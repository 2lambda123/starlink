\section {Introduction}

KAPPA is package of general-purpose astronomical image-processing and
visualization commands. It is documented in \xref{SUN/95}{sun95}{}. Over
the long history of the KAPPA package, many internal Fortran subroutines
have been written to provide facilities within KAPPA which have
subsequently proved to be of more-general use outside KAPPA. In order to
gain the benefit of these internal KAPPA facilities, software developers
have in the past taken copies of the relevant routines and included them
in their own projects. The disadvantages of this are obvious---it is easy
to end up with many, potentially different, copies of the same routines
within a large software suite such as the Starlink Software Collection,
and bug fixes need to be implemented in many different places, rather
than a in single master copy.

Another way of using the internal KAPPA routines is to link your
applications directly against the libraries in the KAPPA package, but
this requires the KAPPA package to be installed anywhere where your
software is to be built, which is not always convenient.

To get round these problems, the KAPLIBS package was created to
contain the internal routines from KAPPA which are deemed to be
``generally useful''. Now, you only need to have KAPLIBS installed to
build your software, not the much larger KAPPA.

There are a large number of routines in KAPLIBS, making it potentially
difficult to find the routines you want. To ease this problem, a search
tool is provided which allows the contents of this document to be
searched (see \hyperref{here}{Section~}{}{SEC:SEARCH}).

\subsection{Stability of the KAPLIBS Interface}
KAPLIBS was created as a pragmatic solution to the problem of
proliferation of KAPPA source code in several other packages. One of the
reasons for previously keeping these routines hidden away within KAPPA was
so that changes could be made to the argument lists or functionality
of these routines without breaking software within other packages. In
practice, it has hardly ever been necessary to change the interface to
routines after an initial development period, but the possibility still
exists that this may be necessary. For this reason, users of KAPLIBS
should be aware that \emph{it may occasionally be necessary to change the
interface to KAPLIBS routines}. Such changes will be listed within
this document at each release. To aid developers decisions over which
routines to use, routines which are deemed to have a significant chance
of being changed within the foreseeable future are highlighted later in
this document. This class of routine will normally just include routines
which have only recently been written.

\subsection{The Scope of this Document}
The purpose of this document is to give reference information about the
argument lists and functionality of the internal KAPPA routines which are
contained within KAPLIBS. It does not give a detailed explanation of how
these routines should be used within a real application. Developers
should usually study examples of existing code within KAPPA for this
purpose. The source code for KAPPA is available from the source code
repository at \htmladdnormallink{https://github.com/Starlink/starlink}{https://github.com/Starlink/starlink}.

Applications within KAPPA are split up into several groups (called
``monoliths'), with names such as \texttt{kapview}, \texttt{ndfpack} and
(rather confusingly but at one time the only KAPPA monolith)
\texttt{kappa}. The top-level routines for the
applications in monolith \texttt{xyz} are in the tar file \texttt{
\$KAPPA\_DIR/xyz\_sub.tar}. Each application may use some
application-specific subroutines (\emph{i.e.} subroutines which are so
closely related to the purpose of a single application that they are not
deemed as ``generally useful''). These will be denoted by subroutines
names with prefix ``\texttt{KPS1\_}'' and will be contained within the tar
file \texttt{\$KAPPA\_DIR/kapsub\_sub.tar}.

\section{Naming Conventions}
Each subroutine within KAPLIBS has a name of the form \texttt{<prefix>\_<name>}
where \texttt{<prefix>} is a prefix indicating which KAPPA library the
routine belongs to, and \texttt{<name>} is a unique name for the routine.
The prefix associated with each KAPPA library indicates something of the
purpose of that library. The following prefixes are currently included
within KAPLIBS:

\begin{description}

\item [AIF\_] These are old routines which were used to access parameter
values or temporary work space. They are gradually being replaced within
KAPPA by more modern routines provided by the PAR and PSX libraries.

\item [FTS1\_] These are routines used to access FITS files and headers -
KAPPA's own \texttt{fitsio}.

\item [IRA\_] These routines were initially part of the IRAS90 Astrometry
library (hence the IRA acronym). They are used to gain access to WCS
information stored within NDFs in the form of IRAS90 Astrometry extension.
This form of WCS is now deprecated in favour of the NDF WCS component,
accessed through the \xref{AST}{sun210}{} library.

\item [KPG1\_] These are other general-purpose routines which do not fall
into such obvious groups.  Even within this library, though, there are
loose associations of routines, usually indicated by some common element
within the routine name. The following are some of the more significant
associations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Routines associated with use of the PGPLOT graphics package usually
have names which start ``\texttt{KPG1\_PG}''.
\item Routines associated with use of the AGI graphics database usually
have names which start ``\texttt{KPG1\_GD}''.
\item Routines associated with accessing or using WCS information usually
have names which start ``\texttt{KPG1\_AS}''.
\end{itemize}

\end{description}

Within all these groups, some routines have different versions for
processing data with different numerical types. The names of such
routines are identical except for the trailing one or two characters
which indicate the data type processed. These one- or two-character
codes are:

\begin{description}
\item [d] - Double-precision floating point
\item [r] - Single-precision floating point
\item [c] - Character
\item [i] - Single-precision integer
\item [w] - Word (usually two-byte integers)
\item [uw] - Unsigned word (usually two-byte unsigned integers)
\item [bw] - Byte (usually one-byte integers)
\item [ub] - Unsigned byte (usually one-byte unsigned integers)
\item [l] - Logical
\end{description}

Sometimes, routine names are documented as ending with a lower-case
``x''. This indicates that routines exist for various of the above
numerical types. The \emph{actual} routines names will not include the trailing
``x'', but will have one of the above codes in place of the ``x''.

\section{Compiling and Linking}
To compile and link an application with the KAPLIBS package, the following
commands should be used (see \xref{SUN/144}{sun144}{}):

\begin{small}
\begin{terminalv}
% alink adamprog.f `kaplibs_link_adam`
\end{terminalv}
\end{small}

Note the use of \emph{opening} apostrophes (`) rather than the more common
closing apostrophe (')\footnote{Currently, the parameter handling
routines within KAPLIBS have not been separated out, and so it is not
currently possible to link stand-alone (\emph{i.e.} ``non-Adam'')
applications against KAPLIBS.}.

This produces an executable image called {\bf prog}. The
\verb+kaplibs_dev+ command creates soft links within the current
directory to the various include files provided by KAPLIBS. These are
removed by the \verb+kaplibs_dev remove+ command.

\subsection{Linking with Native PGPLOT}
The commands described above will link the application with the Starlink
GKS version of the \xref{PGPLOT graphics library}{sun15}{}. If you wish
to link with the \emph{native} version of PGPLOT, then include the switch
``-nogks'' as follows:

\begin{small}
\begin{terminalv}
% alink adamprog.f `kaplibs_link_adam -nogks`
\end{terminalv}
\end{small}

This will include native PGPLOT in the link list, and cause all GKS and IDI
related items to be removed.

\appendix

\section{Changes in Version 3.5}
\begin{itemize}
\item New generic KPG\_STOCx calculates clipped ordered statistics,
      enabling the API of KPG\_STOSx to remain unchanged.
\item New routine kpgPutOutline creates and stores an STC polygon
      describing the spatial extent of an NDF.  It has an option to
      define a convex hull enclosing specified pixels in an array.
\item KPG1\_WRCAT can store arbitrary headers in the output catalogue.
\item KPG1\_CORRx has a new argument which returns the number of used
      points.
\item The random number seed can now be set via environment variable
      STAR\_SEED.
\item kpgGtobj can now create an AST Region describing the coverage of
      a supplied NDF.
\item Fixed a bug in CCG\_FLX1 affecting variance calculations where the
      width was not squared in summations.  This would affect the integ
      estimator in tasks such as KAPPA::COLLAPSE.
\item Prevent values falling outside the histogram in KPG1\_OPGR1.
\item Fixed a memory leak in kpg1Kygp1.
\end{itemize}


\section{Changes in Version 3.4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Handles 64-bit integers.
\item New KPG1\_KY2HD and kpg1Ky2hd have been moved to the ATL library.
\item Added KPG1\_QUOTE to put single quotes round a string and escape any
      embedded single quotes.
\end{itemize}


\section{Changes in Version 3.3}
\begin{itemize}
\item New generic KPG1\_CORRx routine to calculate the Pearson correlation
      coefficient of two arrays.
\item New methods in CCG\_COMNB1/2 to combine lines to give the number (or
      fraction) of good (or bad) pixels.
\end{itemize}


\section{Changes in Version 3.2}
\begin{itemize}
\item New KPG\_TYPSZ routine adapted from CONVERT's COF\_TYPSZ that
      returns the number of bytes for a given numeric HDS data type.
\item Routine KPG1\_BADBX now has an extra argument that indicates how the
      calculated bounding box should be used.
\item Routine KPG1\_ASSET now allows the new pseudo-attribute \texttt{TEXTMARGIN}
      to be used to specify a margin to clear around a text string. The
      value of the attribute gives the width of the margin in units of the
      text height.
\item C wrappers have been added for KPG1\_BADBX, KPG1\_GTOBJ, and KPG1\_PXSCL.
\item A bug handling default-configuration settings in kpg1Config, resulting in
      an "invalid object pointer" error, has been fixed.

\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 3.1}
\begin{itemize}
\item New C function kpg1Config gets a KeyMap containing configuration
      parameters from the user, with name checking and default values
      supplied.
\item The new routine KPG1\_DSSFM displays information about the storage
      form of an NDF array.
\item There is a new generic routine KPG\_FISEx that fills a section
      of a multi-dimensional array.
\item The new KPG1\_GTGPT routine is a variant of KPG1\_GTGRP to obtain
      groups of strings.  KPG1\_GTGPT supports group members that are not
      `sticky', in other words the strings only last for the current
      invocation of an application.
\item The new more-general KPG\_ISEQN replaces the old IRCAM-specific
      NXTNAM routine.  This increments trailing sequence numbers
      in strings, most often used to generate a series of filenames.
\item Add new routine KPG\_LR2Ax that is the same as KPG\_LDA2x
      (formerly LD2AR) except it processes single-precision sparse data.
\item There is a new routine KPG\_NORVx to replace the old NORMAL.  It
      has the benefits of being generic and can operate on an array.
\item KPG\_OSTAx added.  It uses recurrence formulae to calculate
      simple statistics robustly.  It also extends KPG1\_STATx by
      deriving the skewness and kurtosis.

\item DIMLST is renamed KPG\_DIMLS.
\item ICMMM has been renamed KPG\_IMMMx and made generic.  The
      calculations are now in performed double precision.  Note that
      the API has changed: the first two arguments have been transposed
      to the standard order, and the returned floating-point statistics
      are now double precision.
\item LD2AR has been renamed KPG\_LD2Ax and made generic.

\item Remove FTS1\_TREAD since the MAG library has now been removed
      from the main Starlink source tree.
\item A number of long-deprecated old routines without a package prefix
      have been removed.  These are listed below.  The corresponding
      replacement routines appear in the right column.

\begin{tabular}{lcc}
BAD2Dx  & \multicolumn{2}{l}{KPG\_FISEx setting the fill value to VAL\_\_BADx} \\
CHVALx  & \multicolumn{2}{l}{KPG1\_CHVAx} \\
COPAx   & \multicolumn{2}{l}{VEC\_xTOx or KPG1\_COPY} \\

INSET   & \multicolumn{2}{l}{CHR\_INSET} \\

ZERO2D  & \multicolumn{2}{l}{KPG1\_FILLx setting the fill value to 0.0. } \\
\end{tabular}

\item KPG1\_ASSET now parses the supplied parameter name for a
      non-alphanumeric prefix and suffix to determine whether or not
      temporary attributes are supported via the new KPG1\_GTGPT
      routine.  A suffix indicates that KPG1\_ASSET will be called
      again for the same parameter, affecting the value to write to
      the parameter file.
\item The KPG1\_PLTLN routine now accepts a value 6 for the MODE
      argument, which causes a staircase plot to be produced in which
      bad values are not flanked by vertical lines to the lower edge
      of the plot (as are produced by Mode 1), leaving a gap.
\item KPG1\_STDSx and KPG1\_STFLx can respectively report or log the
      skewness and kurtosis via two additional arguments.  Users of
      these routines will need to modify calling routines accordingly;
      without skewness or kurtosis values to document supply
      VAL\_\_BADD for each undefined statistic.
\item Support for FITS tapes was removed from FTS1\_PHEAD, FTS1\_RDATA,
      FTS1\_RGRDA, FTS1\_RSTAB, FTS1\_SKIP.  Argument MEDIUM in these
      routines now only accepts the value \texttt{DISK}.

\item Config files can now include \texttt{<def>} to revert to the default value.
\item Config files can now include \texttt{<undef>} to store an undefined
      value using kpg1Kymap.
\end{itemize}


\section{Changes in Version 3.0}
\begin{itemize}
\item \xref{CTG}{sun262}{}, \xref{IRQ}{sun261}{}, and \xref{LPG}{sun263}{}
      libraries are no longer in KAPLIBS.  They are autonomous
      libraries each with its own documentation and link scripts.
\item KPG1\_MVBDx added. It modifies an array index (such as produced by
      \xref{PDA\_QSIAx}{sun194}{PDA_QSIAx}) to exclude indices that refer
      to bad data values.
\item KPG\_STOSx added.  It calculates accurate order statistics by
      sorting an array by means of an index, returning the median and
      optionally percentiles.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.8}
\begin{itemize}

\item KPG1\_BADBX added. It returns an NDF identifier for the smallest section
      of a supplied NDF that encloses all the good data values in the NDF.
\item KPG1\_BBOX$<$T$>$ added. It obtains the pixel bounding box of a given
     value within an $N$-dimensional data array.
\item KPG1\_LIKE added. It obtains a section of an NDF that matches either
      the pixel or WCS shape of a given template NDF.
\item KPG1\_KYMAP can read vectors as well as scalars from a GRP
      group into an AST keyMap.
\item \texttt{kaplibs\_link} script now works without attempting to load ADAM
      symbols.
\item Can now be built as a shared library.
\item Added KPG1\_ASTCMN to provide access to KPG\_AST private common block
\item The \xref{HLP}{sun124}{} helper routines are no longer part of kaplibs.
      Use the SHL library instead.
\item KPG1\_SCRSZ is no longer present. Please use
      \xref{ONE\_SCRSZ}{sun234}{ONE\_SCRSZ} instead.
\item Now released under the GPL.
\item kpgGtfts and kpgPtfts can now be used to read and write
      AST FitsChan objects from/to an NDF.
\item KAPLIBS no longer links against Tk (the one Tk routine has been
      removed from KAPLIBS).
\item KAPLIBS now has a public C interface (but not for all routines).
\item Added KPG1\_CGET, which returns the value of an NDF character
      component removing any AST or PGPLOT escape sequences.
\item Added KPG1\_MXMNX, which provides a single interface to the
      existing generic KPG1\_MXMNx routines.
\item Added KPG1\_SCALX, which provides a single interface to the
      new doubly generic KPG1\_SCLxx routines, for scaling
      and shifting data values.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.7}
\begin{itemize}
\item A new routine LPG\_REPLA has been added. It controls a new option
      which allows a single NDF to be used as both input and output for an
      ADAM task.  The default is for this option to be disabled.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.6}
\begin{itemize}
\item The GRF module (grf\_kaplibs.c) has been upgraded to include the
      extra functions needed by AST V3.2.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.5}
\begin{itemize}
\item The KPG1\_FFT... routines have been made significantly faster (at
      the expense of using slightly more memory). For instance, a speed gain
      of a factor 10 is typical for an array of 150000 points.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.4}
\begin{itemize}
\item The KPG1\_WRLST routine now normalises the supplied positions (using
      \xref{AST\_NORM}{sun210}{AST_NORM}) before writing them to the output
      catalogue.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.3}
\begin{itemize}
\item The routine GETHLP has been moved from KAPPA to the KAPLIBS:KAPGEN library.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Script \verb+kaplibs_link+ has been added to enable linking of standalone
      applications.
\item The routine KPG1\_DSFRM has been modified to include details of AST
      SpecFrames. \emph{The argument list has also been changed.}
\item The routine KPG1\_ASMRG has been modified to attempt alignment in
      Domain SPECTRAL.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.1}
\begin{itemize}
\item The KPG1\_CPSTY routine has been added to copy AST Plotting styles
      from one graphical element to another.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.0}
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``-nogks'' switch has been added to the
      \verb#kaplibs_link_adam# command, allowing applications to be linked with
      native PGPLOT instead of the Starlink GKS-based PGPLOT.
\item The routine KPG1\_WRLST now allows the user to choose the
      co-ordinate system in which the positions are stored in the catalogue
      columns. This is done using two ADAM parameters called COLFRAME and
      COLEPOCH (these names are hard-wired into the routine to encourage
      conformity). Consequently, applications which use this routine should add
      definitions for these two parameters to their IFL files.
\item The routine KPG1\_RDLST can now read positions from catalogues which
      do not contain a WCS FrameSet, in certain special cases. That is, if the
      catalogue contains columns called RA and DEC, or X and Y.
\item The IRAS90 IRQ library has been included. IRQ is used to manage
      textual representations of NDF Quality bits.

         estimate which values are corrupt.  This applies to all the

   Estimates the mean of a number of normally distributed data

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine is based on maximising the likelyhood function for
      a statistical model in which any of the data points has a
      constant probability of being corrupt. A weighted mean is formed
      with weights chosen according to the deviation of each data
      point from the current estimate of the mean. The weights are
      derived from the relative probability of being invalid or
      corrupt. A sequence of these iterations converges to a
      stationary point in the likelyhood function. The routine
      approximates to a k-sigma clipping algorithm for a large number
      of points and to a mode estimating algorithm for fewer data
      points.  Different weighting for each data point are allowed to
      accomodate known different intrinsic errors in the input data.

      The variance of the input population is determined from the
      whole population and a new variance is computed, after the
      rejection passes, using the order statistics of a trimmed sample
      with the derived weights and initial numbers. Thus the input data
      should be ordered (either increasing or decreasing) so that means
      which are outliers (due to unstabilities from overly small sigma
      clipping) can have their variance properly estimated.

         which can be abbreviated to the initial letter.

         \texttt{'} Amend\texttt{'}  acts as \texttt{'} Update\texttt{'}  if the keyword exists, but as \texttt{'} Write\texttt{'}
         if the keyword is absent.

         \texttt{'} Delete\texttt{'}  removes a named keyword.

         \texttt{'} Exist\texttt{'}  reports TRUE to standard output if the named keyword
         exists in the header, and FALSE if the keyword is not present.

         \texttt{'} Move\texttt{'}  relocates a named keyword to be immediately before a
         second keyword.  When this positional keyword is not supplied,
         it defaults to the END card, and if the END card is absent,
         the new location is at the end of the headers.

         \texttt{'} Null\texttt{'}  nullifies the value of the named keyword.  Spaces
         substitute the keyword\texttt{'} s value.

         \texttt{'} Print\texttt{'}  causes the value of a named keyword to be displayed to
         standard output.  This will be a blank for a comment card.

         \texttt{'} Rename\texttt{'}  renames a keyword, using the value as the new keyword.

         \texttt{'} Update\texttt{'}  revises the value and/or the comment.  If a secondary
         keyword is defined explicitly, the card may be relocated at
         the same time.  If the secondary keyword does not exist, the
         card being edited is not moved.  Update requires that the
         keyword being edited exists.

         \texttt{'} Write\texttt{'}  creates a new card given a value and an optional

         Each element can be abbreviated to the initial letter.

         \texttt{'} Amend\texttt{'}  acts as \texttt{'} Update\texttt{'}  if the keyword exists, but as \texttt{'} Write\texttt{'}
         if the keyword is absent.

         \texttt{'} Delete\texttt{'}  removes a named keyword.

         \texttt{'} Exist\texttt{'}  reports TRUE to standard output if the named keyword
         exists in the header, and FALSE if the keyword is not present.

         \texttt{'} Move\texttt{'}  relocates a named keyword to be immediately before a
         second keyword.  When this positional keyword is not supplied,
         it defaults to the END card, and if the END card is absent,
         the new location is at the end of the headers.

         \texttt{'} Null\texttt{'}  nullifies the value of the named keyword.  Spaces
         substitute the keyword\texttt{'} s value.

         \texttt{'} Print\texttt{'}  causes the value of a named keyword to be displayed to
         standard output.  This will be a blank for a comment card.

         \texttt{'} Rename\texttt{'}  renames a keyword, using the value as the new keyword.

         \texttt{'} Update\texttt{'}  revises the value and/or the comment.  If a secondary
         keyword is defined explicitly, the card may be relocated at
         the same time.  If the secondary keyword does not exist, the
         card being edited is not moved.  Update requires that the
         keyword being edited exists.

         \texttt{'} Write\texttt{'}  creates a new card given a value and an optional
         comment.  Its location uses the same rules as for the Move
         command.

   Uses co-ordinate system information in the supplied FITS headers

      This constructs an AST FrameSet from the supplied FITS headers
      and adds it into the existing WCS information in the supplied NDF.
      It can also create AXIS structures (see below).

      The information needed to create the FrameSet can be stored
      several times in a single FITS header, using different keywords
      each time. Each of these descriptions is known as an \texttt{"} encoding\texttt{"}
      and AST supports several different encoding schemes (e.g.
      FITS-WCS, FITS-IRAF, DSS, NATIVE).  If the supplied FITS header
      contains more than one encoding then we need to choose which one
      to use. This decision is important because is is possible for
      encodings to be inconsistent (i.e. software may modify one
      encoding without making equivalent modifications to the other
      encodings). The simplest way to make this decision is to hand
      responsibility for it over to the user. In this case, the user
      supplies a list of preferred encodings, and the first of these
      encodings that exists in the FITS header gets used. If the user
      does not know which encoding to use, then we can make an
      intelligent guess by comparing the encodings to see which ones are
      consistent and which ones are not.

      In addition to the WCS component, this routine also creates AXIS
      Centre, Label and Units components in the NDF, but only if they do
      not already exist, and if the FrameSet read from the FITS header
      contains an AXIS Frame. NDF2FITS does not write out the AXIS Frame
      if it is equivalent to pixel co-ordinates, and so no AXIS
      structures will be created by this routine in this case. Also, if
      the AXIS Frame represents linear axis co-ordinates, then there
      will already be AXIS structures in the NDF (created earlier within
      FITSIN), and so again no AXIS  structures will be created by this
      routine. Thus, this routine will only create AXIS structures in
      the cases where the axis co-ordinates are non-linear.

   Gets the value and comment of a named header from a buffer of
   FITS-header card images
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine searches a buffer containing the header card images
      from a FITS file for a keyword NAME; and returns its value and
      comment, and the number of the card image within the buffer array
      that contains the named keyword.  The search ends when the next
      end of a header block, marked by the END keyword, is encountered
      or the buffer is exhausted.  If the keyword is present, THERE is
      .TRUE., otherwise it is .FALSE.   Since all cards images are in
      character format, type conversion is performed.  An error status
      will be returned if the conversion has failed.  If the keyword
      expected to be present more than once, then the argument NOCCUR
      controls which occurrence will be retrieved.  If a keyword is not
      found, then no error results and the argument VALUE remains
      unmodified.

      The name may be compound to permit reading of hierarchical
      keywords.  This routine will probably only work for HISTORY,
      COMMENT and \texttt{'}  \texttt{'}  (blank) if there is just one value given on the
      line, i.e. only one \texttt{"} keyword = value\texttt{"}  before any comment
      marker.  An error will result otherwise.

      This subroutine inserts a number of non-reserved keyword cards

      position.  This provides a way to relocate the existing keyword
      card.  If a keyword card does not exist in the extension, the
      routine will put the keyword card at the specified position and
      will add an equals sign to it, at column 9 for simple keywords or
      immediately after the keyword for compound ones.  To those newly
      added keywords, a character value \texttt{'} \{undefined\}\texttt{'}  is assigned.  To
      write new values for these keywords, you should use subroutine
      FTS1\_WKEYx.

      File Format
   }{
      The file consists of a series of lines, one per editing
      instruction, although blank lines and lines beginning with a ! or
      \# are treated as comments.  Note that the order does matter, as
      the edits are performed in the order given.

      The format is summarised below:

        command keyword\{[occur]\}\{(keyword\{[occur]\})\} \{value \{comment\}\}

      where braces indicate optional values, and occur is the
      occurrence of the keyword.  In effect there are four fields
      delineated by spaces that define the edit operation, keyword,
      value and comment.

      Field 1:  This specifies the editing operation.  Allowed values
      are Amend, Delete, Exist, Move, Null, Read, Write, and Update, and
      can be abbreviated to the initial letter.  Delete removes a named
      keyword.  Read causes the value of a named keyword to be
      displayed to standard output.  Exist reports TRUE to standard
      output if the named keyword exists in the header, and FALSE if
      the keyword is not present.  Move relocates a named keyword to be
      immediately before a second keyword.  When this positional
      keyword is not supplied, it defaults to the END card, and if the
      END card is absent, the new location is at the end of the
      headers.  Write creates a new card given a value and an optional
      comment.  Its location uses the same rules as for the Move
      command.  Update revises the value and/or the comment.  If a
      secondary keyword is defined explicitly, the card may be
      relocated at the same time.  Update requires that the keyword
      exists.  Amend behaves as Write if the keyword in Field 2 is
      not already present, or as Update if the keyword exists.  Null
      replaces the value of a named keyword with blanks.

      Field 2:  This specifies the keyword to edit, and optionally the
      position of that keyword in the header after the edit (for Move,
      Write, Update, and Amend edits).  The new position in the header
      is immediately before a positional keyword, whose name is given in
      parentheses concatenated to the edit keyword.  See \texttt{"} Field 1\texttt{"}  for
      defaulting when the position parameter is not defined or is null.

      Both the editing keyword and position keyword may be compound to
      handle hierarchical keywords.  In this case the form is
      keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  All keywords must be valid FITS
      keywords.  This means they must be no more than 8 characters
      long, and the only permitted characters are uppercase alphabetic,
      numbers, hyphen, and underscore.  Invalid keywords will be
      rejected.

      Both the edit and position keyword may have an occurrence
      specified in brackets [].  This enables editing of a keyword that
      is not the first occurrence of that keyword, or locate a edited
      keyword not at the first occurrence of the positional keyword.
      Note that it is not normal to have multiple occurrences of a
      keyword in a FITS header, unless it is blank, COMMENT or HISTORY.
      Any text other than a positive integer is interpreted as the
      first occurrence.

      Use a null value (\texttt{'} \texttt{'}  or \texttt{"} \texttt{"} ) if you want the card to be a comment
      with keyword other than COMMENT or HISTORY.  As blank keywords are
      used for hierarchical keywords, to write a comment in a blank
      keyword you must give a null edit keyword.  These have no keyword
      appears before the left parenthesis or bracket, such as (), [],
      [2], or (EPOCH).

      Field 3:
      This specifies the value to assign to the edited keyword in the
      the Amend, Write, and Update operations, or the name of the new
      keyword in the Rename modification.  If the keyword exists, the
      existing value or keyword is replaced, as appropriate.  The data
      type used to store the value is inferred from the value itself.
      See topic \texttt{"} Value Data Types\texttt{"} .

      For the Update and Write modifications there is a special value,
      \$V, which means use the current value of the edited keyword,
      provided that keyword exists.  This makes it possible to modify a
      comment, leaving the value unaltered.  In addition \$V(keyword)
      requests that the value of the keyword given between the
      parentheses be assigned to the keyword being edited.

      The value field is ignored when the keyword is COMMENT, HISTORY
      or blank and the modification is an Update or Write.

      Field 4:
      This specifies the comment to assign to the edited keyword for the
      Amend, Write, and Update operations.  A leading \texttt{'} /\texttt{'}  should not be
      supplied.

      There is a special value, \$C, which means use the current comment

      it possible to modify a value, leaving the comment unaltered.  In
      addition \$C(keyword) requests that the comment of the keyword
      given between the parentheses be assigned to the edited keyword.

      To obtain leading spaces before some commentary, use a quote (\texttt{'} )
      or double quote (\texttt{"} ) as the first character of the comment.  There
      is no need to terminate the comment with a trailing and matching
      quotation character.  Also do not double quotes should one form
      part of the comment.

      Value Data Types
   }{
      The data type of the value is determined as follows:
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
            Values enclosed in quotes (\texttt{'} ) or doubled quotes (\texttt{"} ) are
            strings.  Note that numeric or logical string values must
            be quoted to prevent them being converted to a numeric or
            logical value in the FITS extension.

         \sstitem
            Otherwise type conversions of the first word after the
            keywords are made to integer, double precision, and logical
            types in turn.  If a conversion is successful, that becomes the
            data type.  In the case of double precision, the type is set
            to real when the number of significant digits only warrants
            single precision.  If all the conversions failed the value
            is deemed to be a string.

      The best way to illustrate the options is by listing some example
      lines.

          P AIRMASS
      This reports the value of keyword AIRMASS to standard output.

          E FILTER
      This determines whether keyword FILTER exists and reports TRUE or
      FALSE to standard output.

          D OFFSET
      This deletes the keyword OFFSET.

          Delete OFFSET[2]
      This deletes any second occurrence of keyword OFFSET.

          Rename OFFSET1[2] OFFSET2
      This renames the second occurrence of keyword OFFSET1 to have
      keyword OFFSET2.

          W AIRMASS 1.379
      This writes a real value to new keyword AIRMASS, which will be
      located at the end of the FITS extension.

          A AIRMASS 1.379
      This writes a real value to keyword AIRMASS if it exists,
      otherwise it writes a real value to new keyword AIRMASS located
      at the end of the FITS extension.

          N AIRMASS
      This blanks the value of the AIRMASS keyword, if it exists.

          W FILTER(AIRMASS) Y
      This writes a logical true value to new keyword FILTER, which
      will be located just before the AIRMASS keyword, if it exists.

          Write FILTER(AIRMASS) \texttt{'} Y\texttt{'}
      As the preceding example except that this writes a character
      value \texttt{"} Y\texttt{"} .

          W COMMENT(AIRMASS) . Following values apply to mid-observation
      This writes a COMMENT card immediately before the AIRMASS card,
      the comment being \texttt{"} Following values apply to mid-observation\texttt{"} .

          W DROCOM(AIRMASS) \texttt{'} \texttt{'}  Following values apply to mid-observation
      As the preceding example but this writes to a non-standard
      comment keyword called DROCOM.  Note the need to supply a null
      value.

          W (AIRMASS) \texttt{'} \texttt{'}  Following values apply to mid-observation
      As the preceding example but this writes to a blank-keyword
      comment.

          U OBSERVER \texttt{"} Dr. Peter O\texttt{'} Leary\texttt{"}  Name of principal observer
      This updates the OBSERVER keyword with the string value
      \texttt{"} Dr. Peter O\texttt{'} Leary\texttt{"} , and comment \texttt{"} Name of principal observer\texttt{"} .
      Note that had the value been enclosed in single quotes (\texttt{'} ), the
      apostrophe would need to be doubled.

          M OFFSET
      This moves the keyword OFFSET to just before the END card.

          Move OFFSET(SCALE)
      This moves the keyword OFFSET to just before the SCALE card.

          Move OFFSET[2](COMMENT[3])
      This moves the second occurrence of keyword OFFSET to just
      before the third COMMENT card.

      This routine searches for the mandatory FITS-Tables-format header
      cards stored in a buffer, and their values are returned, if they
      are present. Should an item be missing or have an unsupported
      value an error is reported, a bad status is set and the routine
      exits. This version supports mandatory descriptors that are not
      in the correct order.

      There are two methods of opening the FACTS description file. The
      first associates the file with a parameter. Unfortunately, FIO
      filename parameters cannot be given dynamic values.  Therefore,
      the name of the table in the header card images is presented, and
      the naming rule for an FACTS description file given.  The user has
      to type in the file name, when prompted for the FACTS file to be
      created for ADC(/SCAR) usage. However, in the alternative,
      automatic mode, the supplied file name is used with the DSCF
      prefix to open the FACTS file without recourse to the parameter
      system. Information in the FITS headers is transferred to this
      description file.  The mandatory FACTS parameters for a sequential
      disk file are written plus EPOCH, VERSION, NRECORDS and AUTHOR
      where these are known. These are followed by FACTS records
      describing the fields in the table, and the ENDFIELD record.
      Finally all the comment lines in the FITS header are copied, in
      order, to the FACTS file.  Blank comment entries are inserted in

        characters, otherwise it is truncated;
        b) the keyword only contains uppercase Latin alphabetic
        characters, numbers, underscore, and hyphen (this is a fatal
        error except for lowercase letters);
        c) value cards have an equals sign in column 9 and a space in
        column 10;
        d) quotes enclose character values;
        e) single quotes inside string values are doubled;
        f) character values are left justified to column 11 (retaining
        leading blanks) and contain at least 8 characters (padding with
        spaces if necessary);
        g) non-character values are right justified to column 30 for
        mandatory keywords, or when the fixed format is requested
        (unless the value is double-precision requiring more than 20
        digits);
        h) the comment delimiter is in column 32 for the mandatory
        keywords or when the fixed format is requested for non-character
        values, or is at least two characters following the value
        otherwise;
        i) an equals sign in column 9 of a commentary card is replaced
        by a space, issuing a warning message at normal reporting
        level; and
        j) comments begin at least two columns after the end of the
        comment delimiter.

      Some non-fatal errors---a), b), c), d), and i)---produce warning
      messages at message level MSG\_\_NORM.

   Imports WCS information from the supplied FitsChan into the supplied

}{
   \sstdescription{
      An attempt is made to read an AST FrameSet (see SUN/210) from the
      supplied FitsChan. If succesful, it is added into the FrameSet
      representing the NDF\texttt{'} s WCS component. This is done by connecting
      the base Frames of the two FrameSets with a UnitMap (on the
      assumption that they are equivalent). The modified FrameSet is
      then stored back in the NDF (the NDF library will automatically
      remove any PIXEL, GRID and AXIS Frames from the FrameSet as these
      are generated afresh each time NDF\_GTWCS is called).

      The supplied FitsChan may contain more than one description (or
      \texttt{"} encoding\texttt{"} ) of the FrameSet to be added to the NDF, each
      encoding using a different set of header cards. These encodings
      may not all be consistent with each other. For instance, if a
      Starlink application stores a FrameSet twice in a FITS header using
      FITS-WCS and AST native encodings, an IRAF application may then
      modify the FITS-WCS encoding without making equivalent modifications
      to the native encoding. In this case, we should use the FITS-WCS
      encoding in preference to the native encoding when reconstructing
      the NDFs WCS component. On the other hand, if the two encodings were
      still consistent, it would be preferable to use the native encoding
      since the FITS-WCS encoding may not give a complete description of the
      original FrameSet.

      The choice of encoding has several stages:

      o  If the caller has supplied a list of preferred encodings in the
      ENCODS argument, then the first available encoding in this list is
      used.
      o  If no preferred encodings are supplied, then a check is made to
      see if a native encoding is available. If there is no native encoding,
      then the default encoding supplied by AST is used. This will be a
      non-native encoding selected on the basis of the header cards available
      in the FitsChan.
      o  If a native encoding is available, and is the only available
      encoding, then it is used.
      o  If both native and non-native encodings are available, then the
      first non-native encoding to be found which is inconsistent with the
      native encoding is used. If all encodings are consistent, then the
      native encoding is used. The first inconsistent encoding is used on
      the assumption that software which modifies the native encoding
      (i.e. mainly Starlink software) will also modify the non-native
      encodings so that they remain consistent. Foreign software however
      (i.e. non-AST software) will probably not bother to modify the native
      encoding when the non-native encoding is modified.

      P(2): The latitude (in the Sky Coordinate System specified by
            argument SCS) of the reference point in radians.

      P(3): The first image coordinate (i.e. X value) of the reference
            point. Image coordinates are fractional values in which the
            centre of the pixel (1,1) has coordinates (0.5,0.5).

      P(4): The second image coordinate (i.e. Y value) of the
            reference point.

      P(5): The size along the X image axis, of a pixel centred at the
            reference point, in radians. Actual pixel size will vary
            over the image due to the distorting effect of the
            projection. The absolute value is used.

      P(6): The size along the Y image axis, of a pixel centred at the
            reference point, in radians. The absolute value is used.

      P(7): The position angle of the Y image axis, in radians. That is,
            the angle from north to the positive direction of the Y
            image axis, measured positive in the same sense as
            rotation from north to east. (Here \texttt{"} north\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} east\texttt{"}  are
            defined by the value of SCS). The X image axis is 90 degrees
            west of the Y axis.

      P(8): An angle through which the celestial sphere is to be rotated
            before doing the projection. The axis of the rotation is a
            radius passing through the reference point. The rotation is
            in an anti-clockwise sense when looking from the reference
            point towards the centre of the celestial sphere. The value
            should be in radians. Changing this angle does not change
            the orientation of the image axes with respect to north
            (which is set by p(7)).

   Converts formatted sky co-ordinate values into double-precision
   values
}{
   \sstdescription{
      The input strings are presumed to hold sky co-ordinate values in
      character form.  This routine reads the strings and produces
      double precision values holding the co-ordinate values, in
      radians.

      Each input string can consist of a set of up to three \texttt{"} fields\texttt{"} .
      Each field starts with a numeric value (which can have a
      fractional part) terminated by a character string. This character
      string consists of an optional single character, called the
      terminator character, followed by an arbitrary number of spaces
      The terminator character (if present) must be one of the letters
      h,d,m,s or r.  An h terminator indicates that the field value is
      in units of hours. A d terminator indicates that the field value
      is in units of degrees.  An r terminator indicates that the field
      value is in units of radians.  An m terminator indicates that the
      field value is in units of minutes.  An s terminator indicates
      that the field value is in units of seconds.  The interpretation
      of minutes and seconds depends on whether the value is a time
      value or an angle value. The longitude value for equatorial sky
      co-ordinate systems (RA) is expected to be a measure of time, all
      other co-ordinate values are expected to be a measure of angle.
      These defaults are overriden if the first field is a \texttt{"} degrees\texttt{"} ,
      \texttt{"} hours\texttt{"}  or \texttt{"} radians\texttt{"}  field (as indicated by the presence of a d,
      h or r terminator character).  The interpretation of fields with
      no terminator character depends on which field is being
      considered. If the first field has no terminator, it is assumed
      to be either a degrees or hours field.  If the second or third
      field has no terminator, it is assumed to be a seconds field if
      the previous field was a minutes field, and a minutes field if
      the previous value was an hours or degrees field.

      In addition, an input string may contain a single field with no
      terminator character in an \texttt{"} encoded\texttt{"}  form. \texttt{"} Encoded\texttt{"}  fields are
      identified by the fact that the field contains 5 or more digits
      to the left of the decimal point (including leading zeros if
      necessary).  These fields are decoded into hours or degrees as
      follows: Any fractional part is taken as the fractional part of
      the seconds field, the tens and units digits are taken as the
      integer part of the seconds field, the hundreds and thousands
      digits are taken as the minutes fields, the remaining digits are
      taken as the degrees or hours field. Thus -12345.4 would be
      interpreted as (- 1 hour 23 mins 45.4 seconds) or (- 1 degree 23
      mins 45.4 seconds). The same value could also be specified as
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         1 23 45.5, -1h 23m 45.5s (if it represents a time value), or

         \sstitem
         1d 23 45.5 (if it represents an angular value).

      }
      The supplied values must be in their first order ranges (i.e. 0
      to 2.PI for longitude values and -PI/2 to $+$PI/2 for latitude
      values). Values outside these ranges cause an error to be
      reported, and the status value IRA\_\_RANGE is returned). The
      exception to this is if the string is prefixed with a \texttt{"} $*$\texttt{"}
      character, in which case any numeric value may be supplied. In
      this case the supplied value is returned directly (e.g. if the
      string \texttt{"} $*$400D\texttt{"}  is given, the radian equivalent of 400 degrees
      will be returned, not 40 (=400-360) degrees).  If either of the
      input strings are blank the corresponding output value is set to
      the Starlink \texttt{"} BAD\texttt{"}  value (VAL\_\_BADD).

      Besselian or Julian epoch, and enclosed in parentheses. The
      named coordinate system is then referred to the mean equinox of

      EQUATORIAL

             The longitude axis is Right Ascension, the latitude axis
             is Declination. Other legal names can be made by appending
             an equinox specifier (eg EQUATORIAL(B1983.5) ). If no
             equinox specifier is added, the coordinates are referred
             to the mean equinox of Besselian epoch 1950.0. If the
             equinox is described by a Besselian epoch, the old FK4
             Bessel-Newcomb system is used. If a Julian epoch is used,
             the new IAU 1976, FK5, Fricke system is used.

      GALACTIC

             The longitude axis is galactic longitude and the latitude
             axis is galactic latitude, given in the IAU 1958 galactic
             coordinate system.

      ECLIPTIC

             The longitude axis is ecliptic longitude and the latitude
             axis is ecliptic latitude. Other legal names can be made
             by appending an equinox specifier (eg ECLIPTIC(B1983.5) ).
             If no equinox specifier is added, the coordinates are
             referred to the mean equinox of Besselian epoch 1950.0.

      AZEL

             The longitude axis is horizon azimuth and the latitude axis is
             horizon elevation.

      All sky coordinate values supplied to, or returned from any IRA
      routine, are given in units of radians.

      NDF\_PIXEL.

      If TRIM is .TRUE., then the Current Frame obtained from the NDFs WCS
      component is also modified so that it has NDIM axes. If the original
      Current Frame has more than NDIM axes, then the axes to use are
      obtained from the environment using parameter USEAXIS. A new Current
      Frame is then made by picking these axes from the original Current
      Frame, assigning the value AST\_\_BAD to the axes which have not been
      chosen.

      If the original Current Frame has fewer than NDIM axes, then simple
      axes are added into the new Current Frame to make up a total of
      NDIM. These axes are given the value 1.0.

      Various environment parameters may be used to obtain options, etc. The
      names of these parameters are hard-wired into this subroutine in
      order to ensure conformity between applications.

   \sstdescription{
      This routine is intended to be registered with an AST Plot (using
      AST\_GRFSET) so that it is subsequently used to draw all lines. When
      called by AST, it calls the underlying PGPLOT line drawing function
      to draw the polyline specified by N, X and Y, and then records the
      details of the drawn polyline in an AST KeyMap (previously specified
      by calling KPG1\_ASPLG). This KeyMap can then be interogated in order
      to determine what lines were drawn. A new entry is added to the
      KeyMap each time this function is called. Each such entry is itself
      a KeyMap containing three entries with keys \texttt{"} N\texttt{"} , \texttt{"} X\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} Y\texttt{"} . The \texttt{"} N\texttt{"}
      entry is a scalar integer holding the corresponding N value, and
      the other two are single precision vector entries holding the X and
      Y values.

      KPG1\_ASPLG should be called prior to registering this function
      using AST\_GRFSET.

   Allows the specification of attribute values for an AST Object
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine allows the user to set attributes for an AST Object (see
      SUN/210). The value to which an attribute is set in the returned
      Object is determined as follows.

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         If the user supplies a value for the attribute using the given
         parameter, then the Object is returned with the attribute set to
         the supplied value. The user supplies the attribute values as a
         GRP group expression in which each element is an AST attribute
         setting. The group expression may comprise persistent and/or
         temporary attributes, the former preceding the latter separated by
         a delimiting string (see argument PARAM).  Persistent values are
         recorded in the parameter\texttt{'} s current value and so can be re-used,
         whereas temporary attributes are not recorded and only apply to the
         current invocation of a task.

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, if the Object already had an explicit value set for the
         attribute on entry (i.e. if AST\_TEST returns .TRUE. for the
         attribute), then the value is unchanged on exit.

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, a search is made for a default value for the attribute
         using the search path described below. If a default value is found
         for the attribute then the Object is returned with the attribute set
         to the default value. The use of these defaults can be suppressed
         by including the string \texttt{"} CLEAR\texttt{"}  as the first element in the group of
         attribute values supplied for the specified environment parameter.

      }
      Defaults are specified as a group of attribute setting strings within a
      \texttt{"} defaults\texttt{"}  text file. This file is found using the following search
      path:

      1) If the environment variable $<$APP$>$\_$<$PARAM$>$ is defined ($<$APP$>$ and
      $<$PARAM$>$ in upper case), its value is taken to be the full path to
      the defaults file.

      2) If $<$APP$>$\_$<$PARAM$>$ is not defined, the file \$HOME/$<$app$>$\_$<$param$>$.def
      is used ($<$app$>$ and $<$param$>$ in lower case).

      3) If the file \$HOME/$<$app$>$\_$<$param$>$.def cannot be accessed, the file
      \$KAPPA\_DIR/$<$app$>$\_$<$param$>$.def is used.

      4) If the file \$KAPPA\_DIR/$<$app$>$\_$<$param$>$.def cannot be accessed, the
      value of environment variable KAPPA\_$<$PARAM$>$ is taken to be the full
      path to the defaults file.

      5) If KAPPA\_$<$PARAM$>$ is not defined, the file \$HOME/kappa\_$<$param$>$.def
      is used.

      6) If the file \$HOME/kappa\_$<$param$>$.def cannot be accessed, the file
      \$KAPPA\_DIR/kappa\_$<$param$>$.def is used.

      Each attribute setting within a group of settings should be of the
      form \texttt{"} $<$name$>$=$<$value$>$\texttt{"} , where $<$name$>$ is taken to be the name of a
      Object attribute (or synonym set by KPG1\_ASPSY), and $<$value$>$ is taken
      to be the value to assign to the attribute. These attributes are
      described in SUN/210. No error is reported if unrecognised attribute
      names or illegal attribute values are specified.

      Before being used, the attribute settings are edited to replace any
      synonyms by their corresponding AST attribute names established by
      earlier calls to KPG1\_ASPSY. Colour names are also replaced by
      corresponding PGPLOT colour indices.

   Trims axes from the current Frame of a FrameSet
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine ensures that the number of axes in the current Frame of
      the supplied FrameSet is the same as the number in the base Frame.
      If this is not the case on entry, a new Frame with the required number
      of axes is created and added into the FrameSet and becomes the new
      current Frame.

      If the original current Frame has too few axes, the new Frame is a
      copy of the original current frame with extra simple axes added to
      the end. These extra axes are supplied a value of AST\_\_BAD by the
      Mapping which connects the original current Frame to the new current
      Frame.

      If the original current Frame has too many axes, the user is
      allowed to select a subset of the original axes using the environment
      parameter USEAXIS (see below). A new Frame is created by picking
      these selected axes from the original current Frame. This Frame is
      added into the FrameSet using a Mapping which has a forward
      transformation which simply drops the values for the unselected axes.
      The inverse transformation (from new to old Frame) attempts to
      assign usable values for the dropped axes if possible. This is only
      possible if the value for a dropped axis can be determined uniquely
      from the value of one of the selected axes. This may be the case
      for instance in a situation where (RA,wavelength) axes were
      selected from the (RA,Dec,Wavelength) axes describing a 2D longslit
      spectrum. The missing Dec value can probably be determined from the
      RA value because the relationship between RA and Dec is determined
      by the position and orientation of the slit on the sky. If it is
      not possible to determine the value for a dropped axis in this way,
      then what happens depends on whether or not any Frames can be found
      in the FrameSet that are Regions having a Domain name of \texttt{"} ROI$<$n$>$\texttt{"} ,
      where \texttt{"} $<$n$>$\texttt{"}  is a positive integer. If no such Frame can be found,
      AST\_\_BAD is supplied for the dropped axis.

      If the supplied current Frame has too many axes, and one or more ROI
      Regions are found in the FrameSet, then a new Frame is added into
      the FrameSet for each ROI Region found. These new Frames are all
      equivalent, containing axes from the supplied current Frame as
      specified by the USEAXIS parameter, and they are all connected to
      the supplied current Frame via a PermMap. Each PermMap has a
      forward transformation that simply drops the unwanted axis values.
      The inverse transformation of each PermMap supplies suitable values
      for the unwanted axes. These are determined by transforming the
      bounding box of the corresponding ROI Region into the original current
      Frame. The Domain name of the corresponding ROI Region is stored in
      the Ident attribute of the new Frame, and is also appended to the
      end of the Frame\texttt{'} s Domain. The new Frame corresponding to the lowest
      numbered ROI Region is left as the current Frame on exit.

      Various environment parameters may be used to obtain options, etc. The
      names of these parameters are hard-wired into this subroutine in
      order to ensure conformity between applications.

      This routine is used to parse a character specification which

      to it.

      An asterisk may be used as a wildcard.  Thus 5-$*$ specifies all
      numbers upwards from 5 inclusive, the upper bound being given by
      the largest integer.  $*$ indicates all integers, i.e. the bounds

   Determines the data limits for an array using a variety of
   methods
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine derives a data range applicable to the supplied
      array.  It is intended to be used to specify the data limits for
      histogram plots and scaling data for image display.  There is a
      variety of methods available to derive the limits, of which a
      subset of appropriate methods can be defined by argument METHOD.

      The method is selected by the user through the literal parameter
      specified by PARAM.  The supplied string should consist of up to
      three sub-strings or elements, separated by commas.  In all but
      one method, the first element must specify the method to use.  If
      supplied, the other two elements should be numerical values as
      described below (default values will be used if these elements are
      not provided).  The following options are available.

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
            \texttt{"} Extended\texttt{"}  -- LOWER and UPPER are returned equal to the
            lowest and highest supplied data values, extended to give a
            margin of 2.5\% of the total data range at each end.

         \sstitem
            \texttt{"} Extended,10,5\texttt{"}  -- Like \texttt{"} Extended\texttt{"} , except the margins at the
            two ends are specified as a pair of numerical value in the
            second and third elements of the array.  These values are
            percentages of the total data range.  So, \texttt{"} Extended,10,5\texttt{"}
            includes a margin of 10\% of the total data range in LOWER, and
            5\% in UPPER.  If only one numerical value is given, the same
            value is used for both limits.  If no value is given, both
            limits default to 2.5.  \texttt{"} Range\texttt{"}  is equivalent to
            \texttt{"} Extended,0,0\texttt{"} .

         \sstitem
            \texttt{"} Faint\texttt{"}  -- The scaling is between the mean data value minus
            one standard deviation and the mean data value plus seven
            standard deviations.  This is retained for historical reasons.

         \sstitem
            \texttt{"} Limit\texttt{"}  --  Allows user to supply explicit lower and upper
            limiting values.  For example, \texttt{"} Limit,10,20\texttt{"}  would set the
            lower limit to 10 and its upper limit to 20.  For compatibility
            reasons and for ease of use, this routine permits the omission
            of the method.  Thus \texttt{"} 10,20\texttt{"}  is equivalent to the previous
            example.  The upper limit may be numerically smaller than the
            lower limit, as might be needed for display scaling.  If fewer
            than two numerical values are supplied, the \texttt{"} Range\texttt{"}  method is
            adopted.  The limits must be within the allowed range for the
            data type of the ARRAY argument.

         \sstitem
            \texttt{"} Percentiles,5,95\texttt{"}  -- The second and third elements of the
            array are interpreted as percentiles.  For instance,
            \texttt{"} Perc,5,95\texttt{"}  causes 5\% of the data points to be below LOWER, and
            10\% to be above the UPPER.  If only 1 value (p1) is supplied,
            the other one, p2, defaults to (100 - p1).  If no values are
            supplied, p1 and p2 default to 5 and 95 respectively.  Values
            must be in the range 0 to 100.

         \sstitem
            \texttt{"} Range\texttt{"}  -- LOWER and UPPER are returned equal to the lowest
            and highest supplied array values.

         \sstitem
            \texttt{"} Sigmas,2,3\texttt{"}  -- The second and third elements of the array
            are interpreted as multiples of the standard deviation of the
            data values.  For instance, \texttt{"} S,2,3\texttt{"}  causes the LOWER to be the
            mean of the data values, minus two sigma, and UPPER to be the
            mean plus three sigma.  If only 1 value is supplied, the same
            value is used for both limits.  If no values are supplied, both
            values default to 3.0.

      }
      The above method names can be abbreviated to one character.

      If the parameter name is supplied as blank, then \texttt{"} Range\texttt{"}  is
      assumed (i.e. LOWER and UPPER are chosen so that the
      encompasses the entire data range).

      The extreme values are reported unless the limits parameter PARAM
      is specified on the command line.  In this case extreme values
      are only calculated where necessary for the chosen method.

      Fourier co-efficients (as produced by FFTPACK subroutine KPG1\_DRFFTF)
      so that the returned array looks like the equivalent array returned
      by NAG routine C06FAF.

      This function is equivalent to PDA\_DR2NAG except that it uses work
      space for greater speed.

      The real and imaginary co-efficients produced by KPG1\_DRFFTF are numerically
      larger than the corresponding C06FAF co-efficients by a factor of
      SQRT( NP ), and are ordered differently. Both routines return A0
      (the zeroth real term, i.e. the DC level in the array) in element 1.
      KPG1\_DRFFTF then has corresponding real and imaginary terms in adjacent
      elements, whereas C06FAF has all the real terms together, followed by
      all the imaginary terms (in reverse order):

         KPG1\_DRFFTF:  A0,    A1, B1,     A2, B2,     A3, B3,   ...
         C06FAF:       A0,    A1, A2, A3, ...,        ..., B3, B2, B1

      The zeroth imaginary term (B0) always has the value zero and so is
      not stored in the array. Care has to be taken about the parity of the
      array size. If it is even, then there is one more real term than
      there is imaginary terms (excluding A0), i.e. if NP = 10, then the
      co-efficients are stored as follows:

         KPG1\_DRFFTF:  A0, A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3, A4, B4, A5
         C06FAF:       A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, B4, B3, B2, B1

   Finds values corresponding to specified fractions of an array\texttt{'} s
   ordered distribution
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine finds the values at defined fractions of an array\texttt{'} s
      ordered distribution, such as percentiles.  Thus to find the
      upper-quartile value, the fraction would be 0.75.  Since it uses
      an histogram technique rather than sorting the whole array, for
      efficiency, the result may not be exactly correct.  However,
      the histogram has a large number of bins (10000), combined with
      linear interpolation between bins in the routine reduce the error.
      The histogram extends between the minimum and maximum data values.

      The routine also has an iterative method, whereby outliers, which
      compress the vast majority of data values into a few bins, are
      excluded from the histogram.  Clipping occurs from both ends.
      A contiguous series of bins are removed until the largest
      or smallest fraction is encountered.  Where the rejection of bins
      end, defines new limits, encompassing the vast majority of values.
      A new histogram is calculated using these revised limits.  The
      excluded outliers are still counted in the evaluation of the
      fractions.  The criterion for iteration may need tuning in the
      light of experience.  At present it is when there are fewer than
      4\% non-zero bins.

      The iteration can still fail to find accurate fractional values if
      smallest and largest fractions are close to 0 or 1 and correspond
      to extreme outliers.  The routine recognises this state and
      determines the values for each outlier fraction separately, and
      then uses the next interior fraction as the limit.  Then the
      routine proceeds with the clipping described above.

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine makes the specified graphics-database (AGI) picture
      current, creates a corresponding PGPLOT viewport and window, and
      returns a Plot associated with the picture.

      On exit, the PGPLOT viewport corresponds to the area encompassed by
      the specified picture. The world co-ordinate bounds within this
      viewport are set so that the PGPLOT world co-ordinate system is
      millimetres from the bottom-left corner of the view surface. This
      corresponds to the Base (GRAPHICS) Frame in the returned Plot.

      The returned Plot will normally be obtained from the MORE structure
      in the graphics database (where it was stored by a previous AST-based
      application). The Base Frame will be a GRAPHICS Frame, giving
      millimetres from the bottom-left corner of the view surface.

      If no Plot is available in the database, then an initial PLOT is
      created containing a Base Frame with Domain GRAPHICS (giving
      millimetres from the bottom-left corner of the view surface), and
      a Current Frame corresponding to AGI world co-ordinates. The Frame
      to represent AGI world co-ordinates in the Plot may be supplied by
      the calling application (for instance, an application may supply a
      PIXEL Frame on the assumption that AGI world co-ordinates are pixel
      co-ordinates). If no such Frame is supplied then a simple Frame is
      used, with Domain set to AGI\_WORLD.

      A third Frame may optionally be added to the Plot representing AGI
      DATA co-ordinates. This Frame will have Domain AGI\_DATA, and the
      Mapping from world to data co-ordinates will be given by the
      TRANSFORM structure stored with the picture in the database. If
      present, it will be the Current Frame in the Plot on exit. See
      \texttt{"} Usage\texttt{"}  below for warnings about using this option.

      Finally, some other Frames are added to the Plot representing
      various normalised co-ordinates:

      BASEPIC: The co-ordinates of the bottom-left corner of the BASE
      picture are (0,0). The shorter dimension of the BASE picture has
      length 1.0, and the other axis has a length greater than 1.0.

      NDC: Normalized device co-ordinates. The bottom-left corner of the
      screen is (0,0) and the top-right corner is (1,1).

      CURPIC: The co-ordinates of the bottom-left corner of the current
      picture are (0,0). The shorter dimension of the current picture has
      length 1.0, and the other axis has a length greater than 1.0.

      CURNDC: The co-ordinates of the bottom-left corner of the current
      picture are (0,0), and the top-right corner is (1,1).

      If the Plot read from the database already contains any of these
      Frames then they are retained and no new Frame is added.

   Finds the default limits for a graph axis

   \sstdescription{
      This routine returns one or both default limits for a graph axis.
      Any limits which are supplied by the calling routine are used as
      supplied. The user is only allowed to over-ride limits which are
      supplied as VAL\_\_BADR. The way in which these limits are chosen is
      specified by the user through the parameter specified by PARAM.
      This parameter can take the following values:

            \texttt{"} Range\texttt{"}  -- LIM1 and LIM2 are returned equal to the lowest and

            and third elements of the array. These values are percentages of
            the total data range. So, \texttt{"} Extended,10,5\texttt{"}  includes a margin of 10\%
            of the total data range in LIM1, and 5\% in LIM2. If only one
            numerical value is given, the same value is used for both limits. If
            no value is given, both limits default to 2.5. \texttt{"} Range\texttt{"}  is equivalent

            of the data points (ignoring error bars) to be below LIM1, and 10\%
            to be above the LIM2. If only 1 value (p1) is supplied, the other

            LIM1 to be the mean of the data values, minus two sigma, and LIM2
            to be the mean plus three sigma. If only 1 value is supplied, the
            same value is used for both limits. If no values are supplied, both
            values default to 3.0.

   Obtains a group of strings from the environment including some

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine obtains group of strings using the specified
      parameter, and returns them in a GRP group (see SUN/150).

      The user specifies the strings by supplying a GRP group expression
      for the parameter value.  If the final character in the supplied
      string is the group \texttt{"} flag character\texttt{"}  (a minus sign by default),
      then the user is re-prompted for another group expression, and the
      strings specified by the second group expression are appended to
      the returned group.  This continues until a group expression is
      supplied that does not end with the continuation character, or a
      null value is supplied (which is annulled).

      The group comprises an optional persistent part that will be
      written as the parameter\texttt{'} s current value, and an optional
      temporary component that only exists for the duration of the
      current application.  The division is determined by the first
      appearance within the string supplied of a delimiter string or
      character (the DELIM argument).  For instance, assume the
      delimiter is \texttt{'} $+$\texttt{'} .  If the supplied value is
      \texttt{'} smooth,box=5$+$filter=gauss\texttt{'} , the persistent value would be
      \texttt{'} smooth,box=5\texttt{'}  and the temporary value \texttt{'} filter=gauss\texttt{'} .  Supplying
      merely the temporary value, such as \texttt{'} $+$filter=gauss\texttt{'}  would return
      the existing current value of the parameter as the persistent
      component, and the temporary component is as before.

      Normally, the \texttt{"} current value\texttt{"}  for the parameter on exit would be
      the final group expression.  If more than one group expression was
      supplied, then this will not represent the entire group.  For this
      reason, this routine concatenates all the group expressions
      supplied, and stores the total group expression as the parameter
      value before exiting.  It also stores the concatenated persistent
      components and writes this as the current value.  Since a new
      value is stored for the parameter, the parameter should not be
      given an access mode of READ in the interface file.

      If a null value is supplied the first time the parameter value is
      obtained, then the PAR\_\_NULL status is returned, and SIZE is
      returned as zero (a valid GRP identifier is still returned
      however).  If a null value is supplied on a subsequent access to
      the parameter, then the PAR\_\_NULL status is annulled, and the
      group is returned containing any values obtained earlier.

      4) Stack all these one-dimensional FFTs into a pair of two-dimensional images,
         image AA holds the real part of each FFT, and image BA holds
         the imaginary part.  Each column of AA will have symmetry such

            this routine are made up of one quadrant from each image.  The

      or another KeyMap (if the keyword name contained other components).

      For example, consider a group containing the following lines:

      gaussclumps.epsilon = (0.001,0.002)
      gaussclumps.contrast = 2.3
      clumpfind.naxis = 2

      The returned KeyMap will contain three entries with keys \texttt{"} gaussclumps\texttt{"} ,

      vector entry containing the values 0.001 and 0.002) and \texttt{"} contrast\texttt{"}
      (a primitive scalar entry with value \texttt{"} 2.3\texttt{"} ). The value associated with
      the \texttt{"} clumpfind\texttt{"}  entry will be another KeyMap containing keys \texttt{"} naxis\texttt{"}

      The value associated with the \texttt{"} method\texttt{"}  entry will be the primitive
      scalar value \texttt{"} gaussclumps\texttt{"} .

      Assigning the value \texttt{"} $<$def$>$\texttt{"}  (case insensitive) to a keyword has the
      effect of removing the keyword from the KeyMap. For example:

      $\wedge$global.lis

      This routine locates the centroid of a blob feature within

      A blob is a series of connected pixels above or below the value
      of the surrounding background.

      The routine forms marginal profiles within a search square.  A
      separate background estimate is subtracted from each sample in
      each of the profiles, in order to ensure that he profiles have
      a roughly flat background.  The background estimate used for each
      profile sample is the lower quartile of the array values which
      were included in the sample.  If this quartile cannot be
      calculated (in the case of a one-dimensional array, for instance,
      each sample will have only one contribution and so the quartile
      cannot be found), the background estimate is taken from a straight
      line passing through the first and last points of the profile.

      A background value for each whole profile is then found, and the
      centroid of all data above this background level is found.  The
      whole process is repeated a number of times, using the previous
      centroid position as the new initial guess position.  Iterations

      If the input pixel is negative, then a bad pixel value is

         There is a routine for each numerical data type: replace \texttt{"} x\texttt{"}  in

         arguments supplied to the routine must have the data type
         specified.

         \sstitem
         There are two stages to identify or validate each character
         value obtained from the parameter. In the first the value is
         converted to the required data type. If this is successful, the
         derived numeric value is compared with the range of acceptable
         values defined by VMIN and VMAX.  A value satisfying these
         constraints is returned in the VALUES. The second stage searches
         for a match of the character value with an item in the menu.

         \sstitem
         This routine adheres to the following rules.
            o  All comparisons are performed in uppercase.  Leading blanks
            are ignored.
            o  A match is found when the value equals the full name of an
            option.  This enables an option to be the prefix of another
            item without it being regarded as ambiguous.  For example,
            \texttt{"} 10,100,200\texttt{"}  would be an acceptable list of options.
            o  If there is no exact match, an abbreviation is acceptable.
            A comparison is made of the value with each option for the
            number of characters in the value.  The option that best fits
            the value is declared a match, subject to two provisos.

      LOC1 is an locator for an HDS structure which contains components
      relating to one or more PGPLOT devices. These components, for
      instance, may contain the colour palette or colour table to be used
      with the corresponding PGPLOT device. This routine searches the
      structure for a component relating to the currently opened PGPLOT
      device, and returns a locator for it if found. If not found, and
      if the currently opened PGPLOT device is a GWM window, a search is
      made for a component relating to a GWM window with a different name.
      If no such device is found, (or if an error occurs) DAT\_\_NOLOC is
      returned.

      For instance, if the currently opened graphics device is \texttt{"} x2windows\texttt{"}
      (i.e. \texttt{"} xwindows2/GWM\texttt{"} ), a search is made first for a component called
      AGI\_3801\_2. If this is not found, a search is made for a component
      with a name corresponding to any /GWM device (e.g. AGI\_3800\_1 which
      corresponds to \texttt{"} xwindows/GWM\texttt{"} , or one of the other xwindows sevices).

      The component names used are the same as the names uses for the device
      within the AGI database (e.g. \texttt{"} AGI\_3801\_2\texttt{"} ).

      polynomial surface to a standard Starlink POLYNOMIAL structure,
      as defined in SGP/38.  An empty POLYNOMIAL structure should
      already have been created.  All floating point components within
      the structure are written as DOUBLE PRECISION.

      It is assumed the calling programme has a one-dimensional array of
      coefficients, where COEFF( ( IX - 1 ) $*$ NYPAR $+$ IY ) contains the
      coefficient for the (IX,IY)th term (with NYPAR being the total
      number of Y terms).  Such a one-dimensional array is used by the
      NAG routines and defined in the NAG manual (see Chapter E02 on
      \texttt{"} Curve and Surface fitting\texttt{"} ).

      This routine will convert the coefficient array to
      two-dimensional, flip it around and store it in the POLYNOMIAL
      structure so that DATA\_ARRAY(IX,IY) contains the coefficient for
      the (IX,IY)th term (see SGP/38).

      The routine will also load the TMIN and TMAX arrays with XMIN,
      XMAX, YMIN and YMAX.  Note that these are compulsory when
      VARNT=\texttt{'} CHEBYSHEV\texttt{'}  but optional when VARNT=\texttt{'} SIMPLE\texttt{'} .  In the latter
      case the logical parameter LIMITS will be used to decide whether
      to write the limits.  All the components have type \_DOUBLE.

   Prepares for graphics output
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine opens a graphics device and prepares for graphical
      output using PGPLOT within a new DATA picture. Optional ancillary
      pictures around the DATA picture may also be created. A FRAME
      picture enclosing the DATA picture and any ancillary pictures is
      created if any ancillary pictures or non-zero margins were
      requested.

      An AST Plot is returned which allows plotting within the DATA
      picture. The Base (GRAPHICS) Frame in this Plot corresponds to
      millimetres from the botttom left corner of the view surface.
      The Current Frame in the Plot is inherited from the supplied
      FrameSet (IWCS).

      If there is an existing DATA picture on the device, then the new
      DATA picture can optionally be aligned with the existing DATA
      picture. In this case, the returned Plot is formed by adding any
      supplied FrameSet (IWCS) into the Plot stored with the existing
      DATA picture in the AGI database (a default Plot is used if the
      database does not contain a Plot). The FrameSet is added into the
      Plot by aligning them in the Current Frame of the FrameSet if
      possible. If this is not possible, they are aligned in the world
      co-ordinate system of the picture (stored in the AGI database).
      The Domain of the AGI world co-ordinate system is not stored in
      the database and must be supplied by the calling application using
      argument DOMAIN (this will usually be \texttt{"} PIXEL\texttt{"} ). If alignment is
      not possible in AGI world co-ordinates, then they are aligned in
      the GRID domain. If this is also not possible, they are aligned in
      any suitable Frame.

      On exit, the current PGPLOT viewport corresponds to area occupied
      by the new DATA picture. The bounds of the PGPLOT window produce a
      world co-ordinate system within the viewport corresponding to the
      Base Frame in the returned Plot (i.e. millimetres from the
      bottom-left corner of the view surface - NOT pixel co-ordinates).
      Note, this is different from the world co-ordinate system stored
      in the AGI database with the new DATA picture.

      If the returned Plot contains an AXIS Frame in which the axes are
      scaled and shifted versions of the axes of the AGI world
      co-ordinate Frame (specified by argument DOMAIN), then a
      TRANSFORM structure is stored with the new DATA picture that
      defines AGI Data co-ordinates. This is purely for the benefit of
      non-AST based applications which may use AGI Data co-ordinates
      (AST-based applications should always use the Plot stored with the
      picture in preference to the TRANSFORM structure stored in the AGI
      database).

      Various environment parameters are used to obtain options, etc.
      The names of these parameters are hard-wired into this subroutine
      in order to ensure conformity between applications.

   Produces a graphical representation of a set of points in two
   dimensions
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine produces a graphical representation of a set of
      points in two-dimensional space (e.g. a data value and a position,
      or two data values).  Errors in both data values may be
      represented by error bars. No annotated axes are drawn. The
      calling routine should do this if required by passing the supplied
      Plot (IPLOT) to routine KPG1\_ASGRD.

      PGPLOT should be active, and the viewport should correspond to the
      DATA picture in which the plot is to be drawn. PGPLOT world co-ordinates
      within the viewport should be GRAPHICS co-ordinates (millimetres from the
      bottom-left corner of the view surface).

      The Plotting style is accessed using one or more environment parameters
      specified by PARAM, and may include the following synonyms for graphical
      elements:
         \texttt{"} Err(Bars)\texttt{"}  - Specifies colour, etc. for error bars. Size(errbars)
                       scales the size of the serifs used if ERSHAP=1 (i.e.
                       a size value of 1.0 produces a default size).
         \texttt{"} Sym(bols)\texttt{"}  - Specifies colour, etc. for markers (used in Modes 3
                       and 5).
         \texttt{"} Lin(es)\texttt{"}  - Specifies colour, etc. for lines (used in Modes 1, 2,
                     4 and 5).

      non-repeatable value, and must be called prior to using any PDA
      random number routine. The seed is only set once in each process,
      and is set to a number which combines the process id and the
      current time.

      The process id is included because the \texttt{"} time\texttt{"}  system call
      (implemented by PSX\_TIME) returns the time in seconds. On modern
      machines it is possible for an application to be called several times
      each second, resulting in the same seed being used each time if the
      seed is based only on the time.

      Alternatively, a fixed seed can be used by assigning the seed value
      to environment variable STAR\_SEED.

   Finds a quantile in a (possibly weighted) set of data
}{
   \sstdescription{
      The routine calculates the value of a specified quantile in a set
      of data values, which may be weighted.  In concept (although not
      in practice) it sorts the supplied data values into ascending
      order along with their associated positive weights, if supplied.
      It then finds a quantile Q such that the sum of the weights
      associated with all data values less than Q is a specified
      fraction FRACT of the sum of all the weights supplied.  If no
      weights are supplied, then each data value is assigned unit
      weight.  There are two main applications of this algorithm:

      a) To find specified quantiles of a distribution of data values
      for statistical purposes.  In this case, the weights may
      optionally be used to represent the number of times each data
      value occurs.  In such cases, it may be useful to regard the
      distribution as continuous, and therefore to interpolate linearly
      between data values when obtaining the result.

      b) Alternatively, the values may represent residuals from some
      fitted function.  In this case, by setting FRACT to 0.5, the
      \texttt{"} weighted median residual\texttt{"}  may be found.  This has the property
      that if it is subtracted from all the original residuals, then
      the weighted sum of the absolute values of the corrected
      residuals will be minimised.  Thus, it may be used as the basis
      for iteratively finding an `L1\texttt{'}  fit.  In such cases, the required
      result will be equal to one of the data values (or may lie
      mid-way between two of them) and interpolation between values is
      not normally required.

      Details of the asymptotic time required to execute the original
      SELECT algorithm are not altogether clear from the published
      papers.  It appears that this algorithm may have better average
      performance than other methods and the time required may
      approximate to EL $*$ LOG( MIN( K, EL - K $+$ 1 ) ) where K is the
      rank of the largest data value which is smaller than the quantile
      being sought.  However, Sedgewick (see References) indicates that
      such algorithms should, in general, complete in time proportional
      to EL, so the above formula may be incorrect.  When using
      weighted data, the time will be multiplied by a further factor
      reflecting the non-linearity of the cumulative weight versus rank
      function and the difficulty of inverting it.

   KPG1\_R2NAG
}{
   Converts an FFTPACK Hermitian Fourier transform array into
   the equivalent NAG array
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This subroutine re-orders and normalises the supplied array of
      Fourier co-efficients (as produced by FFTPACK subroutine KPG1\_RFFTF)
      so that the returned array looks like the equivalent array returned
      by NAG routine C06FAE.

      This function is equivalent to PDA\_R2NAG except that it uses work
      space for greater speed.

      The real and imaginary co-efficients produced by KPG1\_RFFTF are numerically
      larger than the corresponding C06FAE co-efficients by a factor of
      SQRT( NP ), and are ordered differently. Both routines return A0
      (the zeroth real term, i.e. the DC level in the array) in element 1.
      KPG1\_RFFTF then has corresponding real and imaginary terms in adjacent
      elements, whereas C06FAE has all the real terms together, followed by
      all the imaginary terms (in reverse order):

         KPG1\_RFFTF :  A0,    A1, B1,     A2, B2,     A3, B3,   ...
         C06FAE:       A0,    A1, A2, A3, ...,        ..., B3, B2, B1

      The zeroth imaginary term (B0) always has the value zero and so is
      not stored in the array. Care has to be taken about the parity of the
      array size. If it is even, then there is one more real term than
      there is imaginary terms (excluding A0), i.e. if NP = 10, then the
      co-efficients are stored as follows:

         KPG1\_RFFTF :  A0, A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3, A4, B4, A5
         C06FAE:       A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, B4, B3, B2, B1

      If NP = 9, then the co-efficients are stored as follows:

         KPG1\_RFFTF :  A0, A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3, A4, B4
         C06FAE:       A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, B4, B3, B2, B1

   Reads a set of positions from a CAT catalogue
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine reads a FrameSet, and a set of positions with
      associated integer identifiers from a CAT catalogue. The FrameSet
      should be stored as an AST Dump in the textual information associated
      with the catalogue. Such catalogues can be created using KPG1\_WRLST.
      If the catalogue does not contain a FrameSet, then a default
      FrameSet will be used if possible. If the catalogue contains
      floating point columns named RA and DEC, then the default FrameSet
      contains a single SkyFrame (Epoch and Equinox are set from the
      EPOCH and EQUINOX catalogue parameters - if they exist). Otherwise,
      if the catalogue contains floating point columns named X and Y, then
      the default FrameSet contains a single two-dimensional Frame with axis symbols X
      and Y, and Domain GRID. If there is also a column named Z, then
      the Frame will be three-dimensional, with a Z axis.

      However the FrameSet is obtained, it is assumed that the columns
      containing the axis values have CAT names equal to the Symbol
      attribute of the corresponding AST Axis. The catalogue columns from
      which to read the axis values are chosen by matching column names
      with Axis Symbols (only columns containing floating point values are
      considered). Frames are checked in the following order: the Base
      Frame, the Current Frame, all other Frames in order of increasing
      Frame index. An error is reported if no Frame has a set of
      corresponding columns.

      It is assumed that position identifiers are stored in an integer column
      with name PIDENT. If no such column is found, the returned position
      identifiers start at 1 and increase monotonically.

      The routine KPG1\_RDTAB is like KPG1\_RDLST, but provides an extra
      option to return a group of position labels read from a LABEL column
      in the catalogue.

      This routine saves a set of positions in a text file as a CAT

      Frames can also be stored in the file as textual information, allowing
      subsequent applications to interpret the positions. Files written with
      this routine can be read using KPG1\_RDLST (and also XCATVIEW etc.).

      The positions are stored in the file in a Frame selected by the
      user using hardwired parameters CATFRAME and CATEPOCH. This Frame
      defaults to a SKY Frame if present, otherwise a PIXEL Frame if present,
      otherwise the original Base Frame within the supplied FrameSet. The
      positions can be supplied within any of the Frames in the FrameSet
      and will be Mapped into the required Frame if necessary.

      If the ID atttribute of the FrameSet is set to \texttt{"} FIXED\_BASE\texttt{"} , then
      the user is not allowed to change the base Frame using parameters
      CATFRAME and CATEPOCH.

      there are special features that are peculiar to the problem of
      contamination by stars.  The routine also returns the standard
      deviation and the skew of the sample.

      these by including or excluding values at either end of the sorted
      values, deciding which values to reject using the Chauvanet
      criterion.  Iterations stop once no more values are rejected; or
      the statistics stabilise; or there is an oscillation between two
      states, in which case the returned statistics are the averages
      found in these two states; or there are too few values remaining.

   kpg1Config
}{
   Creates an AST KeyMap holding a set of configuration parameter values
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This function first creates a KeyMap by reading the values from a
      specified text file (argument \texttt{"} def\texttt{"} ). This text files specifies the
      complete list of all allowed config parameters and their default
      values. The KeyMap is then locked by setting its MapLocked attribute
      to a true value. A GRP group is then obtained from the environment
      using the specified parameter (argument \texttt{"} param\texttt{"} ). The config
      settings thus obtained are stored in the KeyMap. An error is reported
      if the user-supplied group refers to any config parameters that were
      not read earlier from the default file.

      Both the defaults file and the user-supplied configuration may
      contain several sets of \texttt{"} alternate\texttt{"}  configuration parameter values,
      and the set to use can be specified by the caller via the supplied
      \texttt{"} nested\texttt{"}  keymap. For instance, if a basic configuration contains
      keys \texttt{"} par1\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} par2\texttt{"} , the user could supply two alternate sets of
      values for these keys by prepending each key name with the strings
      \texttt{"} 850\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} 450\texttt{"}  (say). Thus, the user could supply values for any
      or all of: \texttt{"} par1\texttt{"} , \texttt{"} par2\texttt{"} , \texttt{"} 450.par1\texttt{"} , \texttt{"} 450.par2\texttt{"} , \texttt{"} 850.par1\texttt{"} ,
      \texttt{"} 850.par2\texttt{"} . Note, values supplied without any prefix take priority
      over values supplied with a prefix.

      The \texttt{"} nested\texttt{"}  keymap supplied by the caller serves two functions: 1)
      it defines the known alternatives, and 2) it specifies which of the
      alternatives is to be used. Each key in the supplied \texttt{"} nested\texttt{"}  keymap
      should be the name of an allowed alternative. In the above example,
      a KeyMap containing keys \texttt{"} 850\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} 450\texttt{"}  could be supplied. No
      error is reported if the user-supplied configuration fails to
      provide values for one or more of the alternatives. The value
      associated with each key in the \texttt{"} nested\texttt{"}  keymap should be an
      integer - the alternative to be used should have a non-zero value,
      and all other should be zero.

      So first, the configuration parameters specified by the supplied
      defaults file are examined. Any parameter that starts with the name
      of the selected alternative (i.e. the key within \texttt{"} nested\texttt{"}  that has
      an associated value of 1) has the name of the alternative removed
      (but only if no value has been supplied for the parameter without
      an alternative prefix - thus \texttt{"} filt=10\texttt{"}  takes priority of \texttt{"} 450.filt=20\texttt{"} ).
      Any parameter that starts with the name of any of the other
      alternatives is simply removed from the configuration. Thus, using
      the above example, if \texttt{"} nested\texttt{"}  contains two entries - one with key
      \texttt{"} 850\texttt{"}  and value \texttt{"} 1\texttt{"} , and the other with key \texttt{"} 450\texttt{"}  and value \texttt{"} 0\texttt{"}  -
      the \texttt{"} 850.par1\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} 850.par2\texttt{"}  entries in the defaults file would be
      renamed as \texttt{"} par1\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} par2\texttt{"}  (so long as no values already existed for
      \texttt{"} par1\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} par2\texttt{"} ), and the \texttt{"} 450.par1\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} 450.par2\texttt{"}  entries would
      be deleted.

      Next, the same process is applied to the user-supplied
      configuration obtained via the specified environment parameter.

      Finally, the values in the user-supplied configuration are used to
      replace those in the defaults file.

      The benefits of using this function are that 1) the user gets to
      know if they mis-spell a config parameter name, and 2) the default
      parameter values can be defined in a single place, rather than
      hard-wiring them into application code at each place where the
      config parameter is used.

   Creates an AST KeyMap holding keyword/value pairs read from a GRP

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This function checks each non-comment, non-blank line in the supplied
      GRP group. An error is reported if any such lines do not have the
      form \texttt{"} keyword = value\texttt{"} , where the keyword name can be a hierarchical
      list of component names separated by dots. The returned KeyMap has
      an entry for each component name found at the start of any keyword
      name. The value associated with the entry will either be a
      primitive value (if the keyword name contained no other components)
      or another KeyMap (if the keyword name contained other components).

      For example, consider a group containing the following lines:

      gaussclumps.epsilon = (0.001,0.002)
      gaussclumps.contrast = 2.3
      clumpfind.naxis = 2
      clumpfind.deltat = 2.0
      method = gaussclumps

      The returned KeyMap will contain 3 entries with keys \texttt{"} gaussclumps\texttt{"} ,
      \texttt{"} clumpfind\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} method\texttt{"} . The value associated with the \texttt{"} gaussclumps\texttt{"}
      entry will be another KeyMap containing keys \texttt{"} epsilon\texttt{"}  (a primitive
      vector entry containing the values 0.001 and 0.002) and \texttt{"} contrast\texttt{"}
      (a primitive scalar entry with value \texttt{"} 2.3\texttt{"} ). The value associated with
      the \texttt{"} clumpfind\texttt{"}  entry will be another KeyMap containing keys \texttt{"} naxis\texttt{"}
      and \texttt{"} deltat\texttt{"} , which will have primitive scalar values \texttt{"} 2\texttt{"}  and \texttt{"} 2.0\texttt{"} .
      The value associated with the \texttt{"} method\texttt{"}  entry will be the primitive
      scalar value \texttt{"} gaussclumps\texttt{"} .

      Assigning the value \texttt{"} $<$def$>$\texttt{"}  (case insensitive) to a keyword has the
      effect of removing the keyword from the KeyMap. For example:

      $\wedge$global.lis
      method = $<$def$>$

      reads keyword values from the file \texttt{"} global.lis\texttt{"} , and then ensures
      that the KeyMap does not contain a value for keyword \texttt{"} method\texttt{"} . The
      calling application should then usually use a default value for
      \texttt{"} method\texttt{"} .

      Assigning the value \texttt{"} $<$undef$>$\texttt{"}  (case insensitive) to a keyword
      has the effect of forcing the value to be undefined. This can
      be useful in defining defaults where the keymap is locked
