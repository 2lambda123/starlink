      SUBROUTINE AIF_OPFIO( FILNAM, ACMODE, FORM, RECSZ, FD, OPEN,
     :                      STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     AIF_OPFIO

*  Purpose:
*     Opens a Fortran sequential file by name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AIF_OPFIO( FILNAM, ACMODE, FORM, RECSZ, FD, OPEN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine opens a sequential file via FIO_OPEN.  Up to four
*     attempts may be made to open the file.  If a null response is
*     supplied the file is not opened, and the flag returned indicates
*     this fact.

*  Arguments:
*     FILNAM = CHARACTER*(*)
*         The name of the file to be opened.
*     ACMODE = CHARACTER*(*)
*         Expression giving the required access mode.
*           Valid modes are: 'READ', 'WRITE', 'UPDATE' and 'APPEND'.
*           For details, see FIO_OPEN.
*     FORM = CHARACTER*(*)( READ )
*         Expression giving the required formatting of the file.
*           Valid formats are: 'FORTRAN', 'LIST', 'NONE' and
*           'UNFORMATTED'. For details, see FIO_OPEN.
*     RECSZ = INTEGER( READ )
*         Expression giving the maximum record size in bytes.
*           Set it to zero if the Fortran default is required.
*     FD = INTEGER( WRITE )
*         Variable to contain the file descriptor.
*     OPEN = LOGICAL( WRITE )
*         If true the file has been opened.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ, WRITE )
*         Global status value
*
*  Method:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     Initialise looping flag
*     Do while no error obtaining the name and opening the output file
*       and maximum number of attempts not exceeded
*        Get file name and open file
*        If error occurred then
*           If abort requested, do so
*           Increment loop counter
*           If maximum number of attempts not exceeded then
*              Report error
*           Else
*              Set looping flag to exit
*           Endif
*        Else
*           Set flag to indicate that the file has been opened
*           Set looping flag to false
*        Endif
*     Enddo
*     If error then
*        Report and abort
*     Endif
*     Return

*  Bugs:
*     None known.
