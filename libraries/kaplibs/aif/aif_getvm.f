      SUBROUTINE AIF_GETVM( TYPE, NDIM, DIMS, PNTR, WKLOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     AIF_GETVM

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a pointer and a locator to mapped HDS workspace.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AIF_GETVM( TYPE, NDIM, DIMS, PNTR, WKLOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine obtains and file maps a temporary array of a given
*     data type and dimensions via HDS.  A pointer to the mapped work
*     array is returned, as is a locator so that the temporary array
*     may be annulled when no longer required.

*  Arguments:
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The HDS data type of the temporary array.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions of the work array.
*     DIMS( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensions of the temporary array.
*     PNTR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The pointer to the mapped temporary array.
*     WKLOC = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC )(Returned)
*        The HDS locator to the temporary array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The current HDS tuning parameter MAP is stored, so that the
*     temporary array may be accessed via file mapping, and upon exit
*     restored to its former value.

*  Status:

*  Local Variables:

*  Obtain the workspace.

*  Map the workspace.
         CALL DAT_MAP( WKLOC, TYPE, 'WRITE', NDIM, DIMS, PNTR, STATUS )

*  Return to the old tuning setting being careful to ensure that this
*  is successful, even if there has been an error.
