      SUBROUTINE AIF_FLNAM( PARNAM, FILNAM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     AIF_FLNAM

*  Purpose:
*     Returns the name of a file as a character string given its
*     parameter name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AIF_FLNAM( PARNAM, FILNAM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Normally, the handles to HDS data files are locators and files
*     are obtained via the parameter system.  The name of a data
*     file itself is not available to applications via the user-level
*     parameter-system library, and so applications cannot place the
*     file name in log files or use the it to generate compound names.
*     This routine provides that functionality by calling internal
*     parameter-system routines to obtain the name.  This routine also
*     works for Fortran files associated via an ADAM parameter.

*  Arguments:
*     PARNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter name associated with the data object whose name is
*        required.
*     FILNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The name of the file.  If %FILNAM is not long enough a bad
*        status is returned.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This cannot be used to obtain the names of objects within
*        an HDS file.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Get the ADAM internal code that refers to the piece of
*        parameter space associated with the input parameter.
*     -  Get the file name associated with the ADAM internal pointer.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  Must have obtained the file via the input parameter.
