      SUBROUTINE CCG_TRM2<T>( ALPHA, EL, ORDDAT, SVAR, USED, COVAR,
     :                      TMEAN, TVAR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG_TRM2x

*  Purpose:
*     Forms the trimmed mean of the given set of ordered data,
*     returning flags showing which values are used.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG_TRM2x( ALPHA, EL, ORDDAT, ORDVAR, USED, COVAR,
*                     TMEAN, TVAR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine forms the trimmed mean of the given dataset. The
*     alpha (as a fraction) upper and lower ordered values are removed
*     from consideration.  Then the remaining values are added and
*     averaged. The SVAR value is a (given) best estimate of the
*     original un-ordered population variance. The variance of the
*     output value is formed assuming that the original dataset was
*     normal in distribution, and is now fairly represented by the
*     ordered statistics variances-covariances supplied in packed form
*     in COVAR. The elements of the input array which actually
*     contribute to the final value are flagged in the used array.

*  Arguments:
*     ALPHA = REAL (Given)
*        The fraction of data to trim from upper and lower orders.
*        (MUST BE GREATER THAN 0.0 AND LESS 0.5)
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of entries in ORDDAT.
*     ORDDAT( EL ) = ? (Given)
*        The set of ordered data for which a trimmed mean is required.
*     SVAR = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The variance of the unordered sample now ordered in ORDDAT.
*     USED( EL ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If the corresponding value in ORDDAT contributes to the final
*        value then this is set true.
*     COVAR( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The packed variance-covariance matrix of the order statistics
*        from a normal distribution of size EL.
*     TMEAN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The trimmed mean.
*     TVAR = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        A variance estimate of the trimmed mean.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The variance-covariance array must have been generated in a
*     fashion similar to that of ORDVAR.

*        Original version.
*     30-MAY-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Added the used argument.
*     2009 July 4 (MJC):
*         Converted to generic and renamed from CCG1_TRM2R.  Moved EL 
*         (after renaming from NSET) to the normal order in the API.
