      SUBROUTINE CCG_BM3<T>( NPIX, NLINES, STACK, MINPIX, RESULT,
     :                     WRK1, POINT, USED, NCON, NBAD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG_BM3x

*  Purpose:
*     Combines data lines using a broadened median.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG_BM3x( NPIX, NLINES, STACK, MINPIX, RESULT,
*                    WRK1, POINT, USED, NCON, NBAD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine accepts an array consisting a series of (vectorised)
*     lines of data.  The data values in the lines are then combined to
*     form an broadened medium line.  The broadened median is similar to
*     a trimmed mean, except that the trimming fraction changes with
*     the number of values (and is equivalent to a median for fewer than
*     five values).  The output means are returned in the array RESULT.

*  Arguments:
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in a line of data.
*     NLINES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines of data in the stack.
*     STACK( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        The array of lines which are to be combined into a single line.
*     MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The minimum number of pixels required to contribute to an
*        output pixel.
*     RESULT( NPIX ) = ? (Returned)
*        The output line of data.
*     WRK1( NLINES ) = ? (Returned)
*        Workspace for calculations.
*     POINT( NLINES ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Workspace to hold pointers to the original positions of the
*        data before extraction and conversion in to the WRK1 array.
*     USED( NLINES ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Workspace used to indicate which values have been used in
*        estimating a resultant value.
*     NCON( NLINES ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The actual number of contributing pixels from each input line
*        to the output line.
*     NBAD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of bad values in the output array created while
*        forming the statistics.  It excludes those bad values whose
*        corresponding values along the collapse axis are all bad.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for real and double-precision: replace "x"
*     in the routine name by D or R as appropriate.  The STACK, RESULT, 
*     and WRK1 arguments supplied to the routine must have the data type
*     specified.

*  History:
*     19-MAY-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     11-OCT-2004 (BRADC):
*        No longer use NUM_CMN.
*     2009 July 3 (MJC):
*         Converted to generic and renamed from CCG_BMR3R.  Added NBAD 
*         argument.  Moved STACK to the normal order in the API.
*     2009 July 4 (MJC):
*         Made NCON Returned and therefore it is initialised.
*     2009 July 17 (MJC):
*        Do not include collapsed data comprising only bad values
*        in argument NBAD.
