      SUBROUTINE CCG_SUM3<T>( NPIX, NLINES, STACK, MINPIX,
     :                      RESULT, NCON, NBAD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG_SUM3x

*  Purpose:
*     Combines data lines using the sum of values.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG_SUM3x( NPIX, NLINES, STACK, MINPIX,
*                     RESULT, NCON, NBAD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine accepts an array consisting of a series of
*     (vectorised) lines of data.  The data values in the lines are then
*     summed.  The output sums are returned in the array RESULT.

*  Arguments:
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in a line of data.
*     NLINES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines of data in the stack.
*     STACK( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        The array of lines which are to be combined into a single line.
*     MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The minimum number of pixels required to contribute to an
*        output pixel.
*     RESULT( NPIX ) = ? (Returned)
*        The output line of data.
*     NCON( NLINES ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The actual number of contributing pixels from each input line
*        to the output line.
*     NBAD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of bad values in the output array created while
*        forming the statistics.  It excludes those bad values whose
*        corresponding values along the collapse axis are all bad.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric data type: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as appropriate.  The
*     STACK and RESULT arguments supplied to the routine must have the
*     data type specified.  It is not wise to choose an integer type
*     as the chances of overflow are high.

*  History:
*     2005 December 29 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     2009 July 3 (MJC):
*         Renamed from CCG1_SUM3x.  Added NBAD argument. 
*     2009 July 4 (MJC):
*         Made NCON Returned and therefore it is initialised.
*     2009 July 17 (MJC):
*        Do not include collapsed data comprising only bad values
*        in argument NBAD.
