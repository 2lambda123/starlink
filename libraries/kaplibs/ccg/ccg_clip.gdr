      SUBROUTINE CCG_CLIP<T>( VMIN, VMAX, EL, ARRAY, NGOOD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG_CLIPx

*  Purpose:
*     Sets any data outside a given value range BAD

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG_CLIPR( VMIN, VMAX, EL, ARRAY, NGOOD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This generic routine loops over all entries in RA. If any values
*     are outside the range RMIN to VMAX then they are set BAD.

*  Arguments:
*     VMIN = ? (Given)
*        The minimum allowed value.  All values below this are set BAD.
*     VMAX = ? (Given)
*        The maximum allowed value.  All values above this are set BAD.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of entries in ARRAY.
*     ARRAY( EL ) = ? (Given and Returned)
*        The list of values to be clipped within the given range.  On
*        output this contains the clipped list.
*     NGOOD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of values left after rejection.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for real and double-precision: replace "x"
*     in the routine name by D or R as appropriate.  The ARRAY, VMIN,
*     and VMAX arguments supplied to the routine must have the data type
*     specified.

*  History:
*     4-APR-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     15-MAR-1999 (MBT):
*        Modified to use PRIMDAT properly.
*     2009 July 2 (MJC):
*        Converted to generic and renamed from CCG1_CLIPR.  Moved EL
*        (after renaming from NENT) to the normal order in the API.
