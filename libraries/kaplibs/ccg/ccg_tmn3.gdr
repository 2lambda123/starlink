      SUBROUTINE CCG_TMN3<T>( IGNORE, EL, ORDDAT, USED, TMEAN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG_TMN3x

*  Purpose:
*     Forms the n-trimmed mean of the given set of ordered data.
*     This variant does not process variances.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG1_TMN3x( IGNORE, EL, ORDDAT, USED, TMEAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine forms the trimmed mean of the given dataset.  The
*     IGNORE upper and lower ordered values are removed from
*     consideration.  Then the remaining values are added and averaged.
*     The values not rejected are indicated by setting the flags
*     in array used.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of entries in ORDDAT.
*     IGNORE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of values to ignore from the upper and lower orders.
*     ORDDAT( EL ) = ? (Given)
*        The set of ordered data for which a trimmed mean is required.
*     USED( EL ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Flags showing which values have not been rejected.
*     TMEAN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The trimmed mean.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for real and double-precision: replace "x"
*     in the routine name by D or R as appropriate.  The ORDDAT 
*     argument supplied to the routine must have the data type 
*     specified.

*  History:
*     28-MAR-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     4-APR-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed to remove n values from upper and lower orders
*        instead of a given fraction.
*     30-MAY-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Added used array.
*     20-AUG-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Variant of CCG1_TMN2 - variance analysis removed.
*     2009 July 3 (MJC):
*        Converted to generic and renamed from CCG1_TMN3R.  Moved EL 
*        (after renaming from NSET) to the normal order in the API.
