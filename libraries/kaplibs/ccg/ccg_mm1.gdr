*  Name:
*     CCG_MM1x

*  Purpose:
*     Combines data lines using a min-max exclusion trimmed mean.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG_MM1x( NPIX, NLINES, STACK, VARS, MINPIX, NMAT, COVEC, 
*                    RESULT, RESVAR, WRK1, POINT, USED, NCON, NBAD, 
*                    STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine accepts an array consisting a series of (vectorised)
*     lines of data.  The data values in the lines are then combined to
*     form an trimmed mean in which the minimum and maximum values are
*     excluded.  The output means are returned in the array RESULT.  The
*     output variances are propagated from the inverse weights given in
*     array VARS and are returned in the array RESVAR.

*  Arguments:
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in a line of data.
*     NLINES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines of data in the stack.
*     STACK( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        The array of lines which are to be combined into a single line.
*     VARS( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        The data variances.
*     MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The minimum number of pixels required to contribute to an
*        output pixel.
*     NMAT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Size of the first dimension of COVEC.
*     COVEC( NMAT, NLINES ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The packed variance-covariance matrix of the order statistics
*        from a normal distribution of sizes up to NLINES, produced by
*        CCD1_ORVAR.
*     RESULT( NPIX ) = ? (Returned)
*        The output line of data.
*     RESVAR( NPIX ) = ? (Returned)
*        The output variances.
*     WRK1( NLINES ) = ? (Returned)
*        Workspace for calculations.
*     POINT( NLINES ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Workspace to hold pointers to the original positions of the
*        data before extraction and conversion in to the WRK1 array.
*     USED( NLINES ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Workspace used to indicate which values have been used in
*        estimating a resultant value.
*     NCON( NLINES ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The actual number of contributing pixels.
*     NBAD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of bad values in the output array created while
*        forming the statistics.  It excludes those bad values whose
*        corresponding values along the collapse axis are all bad.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for real and double-precision: replace "x"
*     in the routine name by D or R as appropriate.  The STACK, VARS,
*     RESULT, RESVAR, and WRK1 arguments supplied to the routine
*     must have the data type specified.

*  History:
*     19-MAY-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     11-OCT-2004 (BRADC):
*        No longer use NUM_CMN.
*     2006 August 6 (MJC):
*        Exclude data with non-positive variance.
*     2009 July 4 (MJC):
*        Converted to generic and renamed from CCG1_MMR1R.  Added NBAD
*        argument.  Moved STACK, NMAT, and NCON to the normal order in 
*        the API.  Made NCON Returned and therefore it is initialised.
*     2009 July 17 (MJC):
*        Do not include collapsed data comprising only bad values
*        in argument NBAD.
