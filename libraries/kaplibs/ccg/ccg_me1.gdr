      SUBROUTINE CCG_ME1<T>( NPIX, NLINES, STACK, VARS, MINPIX,

*+
*  Name:
*     CCG_ME1x

*  Purpose:
*     Combines data lines using a weighted mean.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG_ME1x( NPIX, NLINES, STACK, VARS, MINPIX,
*                    RESULT, RESVAR, NCON, NBAD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine accepts an array consisting of a series of
*     (vectorised) lines of data.  The data values in the lines are then
*     combined to form a weighted mean. The weights used are are the
*     reciprocal of values given in the array VARS.  The output means
*     are returned in the array RESULT.  The output variances are
*     estimated from the VARS values and are returned in RESVAR.

*  Arguments:
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in a line of data.
*     NLINES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines of data in the stack.
*     STACK( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        The array of lines which are to be combined into a single line.
*     VARS( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        The data variances.
*     MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The minimum number of pixels required to contribute to an
*        output pixel.
*     RESULT( NPIX ) = ? (Returned)
*        The output line of data.
*     RESVAR( NPIX ) = ? (Returned)
*        The output variances.
*     NCON( NLINES ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The actual number of contributing pixels from each input line
*        to the output line.
*     NBAD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of bad values in the output array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for real and double-precision: replace "x"
*     in the routine name by D or R as appropriate.  The STACK, VARS,
*     RESULT, and RESVAR arguments supplied to the routine must have 
*     the data type specified.
*     -  This routine performs its work in double precision.

*  History:
*     20-MAY-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     11-OCT-2004 (BRADC):
*        No longer use NUM_CMN.
*     2006 August 6 (MJC):
*        Exclude data with non-positive variance.
*     2009 July 4 (MJC):
*         Converted to generic and renamed from CCG_ME1x.  Added NBAD
*         argument.  Moved STACK to the normal order in the API.  Made 
*         NCON Returned and therefore it is initialised.
