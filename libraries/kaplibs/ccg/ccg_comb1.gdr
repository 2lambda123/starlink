*  Purpose:
*     Combines a stack of array lines into one line, using a variety of
*     methods.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG_COMB1x( NPIX, NLINES, STACK, VARS, COORDS, IMETH, MINPIX,
*                      NITER, NSIGMA, ALPHA, RMIN, RMAX, NMAT, RESULT,

*  Description:
*     The routine works along each line of the input stack of lines,
*     combining the data.  This variant uses a complete variance array
*     propagates them.
*     
*     The array NCON holds the actual numbers of pixels that were used in 
*     deriving the output value plus any values already present in the 
*     array; thus a cumulative sum of contributing pixel numbers may be
*     kept.

*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for real and double-precision: replace "x"
*     in the routine name by D or R as appropriate.  The STACK, VARS,
*     COORDS, RESULT, RESVAR, WIDTHS, WRK1, and WRK2 arguments supplied 
*     to the routine must have the data type specified.
*     -  Various of the options are simply variations on a theme.  The
*     Broadened median is just a trimmed mean with a variable trimming
*     fraction. The Mode is an iteratively carried out version of the
*     sigma clipping (or more precisely the reverse).  The minmax and
*     threshold mean are also just trimmed means, but require their own
*     mechanisms.
*     -  The 'propagation' of the input variances assumes that the input
*     data are fairly represented by a normal distribution.  This fact
*     is used together with the 'order statistics' of a normal
*     population to form a new variance estimate.  The order statistics
*     are not independent so have non-zero covariances (off diagonal
*     components of the variance-covariance matrix).  All 'trimmed
*     means' of any description use the order of the values to
*     estimate which values are corrupt.  This applies to all the
*     methods supported here except the mean which rejects no data. The
*     variance used to represent the input normal population is the
*     reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocal variances.  We have no
*     other estimate of this value except from the population itself.
*     - Calculations are performed in double precision.

*  History:
*     21-MAY-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version. Revamping of routine structure to increase
*        efficiency and keep in line with new routines.
*     30-JAN-1998 (PDRAPER):
*        Added sigma-clipped median.
*     16-NOV-1998 (PDRAPER):
*        Added fast median.
*     9-SEP-2002 (DSB):
*        Added unweighted mean method.
*     1-NOV-2002 (DSB):
*        Added workspace argument to CCD1_ORVAR.
*     27-AUG-2003 (DSB):
*        Added IMETH 300 to provide a means of estimating the output
*        variances for large samples, for which the memory requirements
*        for the COVEC array would be too large.
*     2005 December 22 (MJC):
*        Added several translations for new estimators and moments 
*        (IMETH=12 upwards except 300).
*     2005 December 24 (MJC):
*        Added mean absolute deviation.
*     2005 December 27 (MJC):
*        Added standard deviation.
*     2005 December 28 (MJC):
*        Add root mean square.
*     2005 December 29 (MJC):
*        Add summation method.
*     2006 January 2 (MJC):
*        Add COORDS argument.
*     2006 January 5 (MJC):
*        Add COIND argument.
*     2006 January 6 (MJC):
*        Add WIDTHS argument and calls for IMETH = 21, 22, 23.
*     2006 January 26 (MJC):
*        Made COORDS and WIDTHS per pixel.  Change calls to
*        reflect new APIs for CCG1_IWC1 and CCG1_IWD1.
*     2006 January 27 (MJC):
*        Use CCG1_I2WC instead of KPG1_VASV to cope with the
*        two-dimensional co-ordinate array.  Derive the widths for
*        IMETH = 21 from the co-ordinates.
*     2007 November 17 (MJC):
*        WIDTHS is returned, not supplied, so move it in the API.
*     2007 December 7 (MJC):
*        Return number of flagged values through new argument NFLAG. 
*        Initialise count of the contributing pixels in each line.
*     2008 September 24 (MJC):
*        Add Option 14.
*     2009 July 2 (MJC):
*         Converted to generic, renamed from CCG1_CM1RR.  Invoke generic
*         routines.  Made VARS take the generic type.  Move STACK and
*         NMAT to normal order in the API.
*     2009 July 4 (MJC):
*         No longer initialise NCON.  This is done in the relevant
*         routines.  Should blocking or chunking be involved in the
*         calling application, a further summation array would be
*         needed at the application level andding the contribution
*         statistics for each block/chunk.  Also moved it to just
*         before the NFLAG argument so it is the same as the statistics
*         routines.  Use revised APIs for invoked subroutines.
*         Use revised APIs for invoked subroutines.
*     2009 July 9 (MJC):
*         Use revised APIS for maxima and minima routines.
