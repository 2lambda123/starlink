      SUBROUTINE KPG1_DWSO<T>( LBND, UBND, AXIS, SCALE, OFFSET, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_DWSOx

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains for the scale and offset for a linear transformation from
*     world to data co-ordinates.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_DWSOx( LBND, UBND, AXIS, SCALE, OFFSET, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines a linear transformation between world
*     (pixel) co-ordinates and data co-ordinates obtained from the axis
*     structure.  A linear equation is solved using the two boundary
*     conditions for the lower and upper bounds in world and data
*     co-ordinates.
*
*  Arguments:
*     LBND = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bound of the axis array.
*     UBND = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bound of the axis array.
*     AXIS( LBND:UBND ) = ? (Given)
*        The axis array.
*     SCALE = ? (Returned)
*        The scale factor of the linear axis to transform from world
*        co-ordinates to data co-ordinates.
*     OFFSET = ? (Returned)
*        The offset of the linear axis at pixel 0 to transform from
*        world co-ordinates to data co-ordinates.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for the data types real or double precision:
*     replace "x" in the routine name by R or D respectively, as
*     appropriate.  The axis array, and the returned scale and offset
*     should have this data type as well.
