      SUBROUTINE KPG1_REPRT( MESS, QUIET, LOG, FD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_REPRT

*  Purpose:
*     Reports a MSG message to user and also optionally write it to a file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_REPRT( MESS, QUIET, LOG, FD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine dislays the supplied message using MSG_OUT (unless
*     QUIET is .TRUE), and (if LOG is .TRUE.) writes out the same text
*     to the file identified by FD.

*  Arguments:
*     MESS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The message, which may contain MSG tokens.
*     QUIET = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Supress screen output?
*     LOG = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Write the text to  a file?
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        An FIO identifier for a file. If LOG is .TRUE., then the message
*        is written to this file.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
