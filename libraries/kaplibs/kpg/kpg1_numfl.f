      SUBROUTINE KPG1_NUMFL( FD, COMENT, NLINES, NCOMS, NBLANK, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_NUMFL

*  Purpose:
*     This counts the number of lines in a text file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_NUMFL( FD, COMENT, NLINES, NCOMS, NBLANK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine counts the number of non-comment, comment, and blank
*     lines in a text file.  Comment lines are those beginning, with
*     any of the characters passed in the COMENT argument (normally !
*     and #).  Here 'beginning' means the first non-blank character.

*  Arguments:
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Fortran file identifier.
*     COMENT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A comma-separated list of comment characters.  If any line of
*        the file begins with one of these, the line is treated as a
*        comment line.
*     NLINES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of non-comment lines in the file.
*     NCOMS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of comment lines in the file.
*     NCOMS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of blank lines in the file.
*     STATUS = INTEGER ({status_access_mode})
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The file is rewound, but not closed on exit.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The Fortran text file must already be opened.
