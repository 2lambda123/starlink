      SUBROUTINE KPG1_COLNM( R, G, B, NAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_COLNM

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the named colour nearest to an RGB triple.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_COLNM( R, G, B, NAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This returns the name of a colour in the standard colour set that
*     matches an input R-G-B colour, or failing that, that is nearest
*     to the input colour.  A city-block metric is used.

*  Arguments:
*     R = REAL (Given)
*        The red intensity of the colour to be identified.  It should
*        be in the range 0.0 to 1.0.
*     G = REAL (Given)
*        The green intensity of the colour to be identified.  It should
*        be in the range 0.0 to 1.0.
*     B = REAL (Given)
*        The blue intensity of the colour to be identified.  It should
*        be in the range 0.0 to 1.0.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The name of the nearest colour in the named colour set to the
*        input RGB colour.  Note at least eighteen characters are
*        required to avoid truncation.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The actual R-G-B colours used will be constrained to lie in the
*     range 0.0--1.0.
