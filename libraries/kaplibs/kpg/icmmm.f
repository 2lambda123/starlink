*  Name:
*     ICMMM

*  Purpose:
*     Iteratively finds the mean, median and mode using the.

*  Language:
*     Starlink

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ICMMM ( ARRAY, DIM, SMEAN, SMED, SMODE, SIGMA, SKEW, NSAM,

*  Description:
*     This finds the mean, median and mode (mmm) of a sample of data
*     taken from a background region of an astronomical plate. It should
*     not be used as a general mmm routine as there are special features
*     which are peculiar to the problem of contamination by stars. The
*     data should not include any invalid pixel values as these are not
*     trapped. The data need not be sorted as a NAG sorting routine
*     (M01CAE, single precision) is called internally. The routine also
*     returns the standard deviation and the skew of the sample.

*     The magic-value method is used for bad pixels.

*  Arguments:
*     ARRAY( DIM ) = REAL( READ )
*        Vector of data samples.
*     DIM = INTEGER( READ )
*        The number of data in the sample.
*     SMEAN = REAL( WRITE )
*        The mean of the sample.
*     SMED = REAL( WRITE )
*        The median of the sample.
*     SMODE = REAL( WRITE )
*        The mode of the sample.
*     SIGMA = REAL( WRITE )
*        The standard deviation of the sample.
*     SKEW = REAL( WRITE )
*        The skewness of the sample.
*     NSAM = INTEGER( WRITE )
*        The population of the sample after the iterative procedure.
*     NINVAL = INTEGER( WRITE )
*        The number of bad pixels in the sample.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER( READ, WRITE )
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.

*  History:
*     1990 Jan 24: First ADAM implementation, based upon the similar
*        routine in DAOPHOT, modified by Nick Eaton; now
*        has bad-pixel handling (RAL::CUR).
*     1990 Jun 3 : Improved handling of variance for the general case
*        (RAL::CUR).
*     1992 Jun 3 : Replaced NAG routine by KAPPA sorting routine.
*        Although the latter is slower it is available on
*        Unix (RAL::CUR).
