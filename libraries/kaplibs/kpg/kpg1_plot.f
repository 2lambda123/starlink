*  Name:
*     KPG1_PLOT

*  Purpose:
*     Prepares for graphics output.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PLOT( IWCS, STAT, APP, DATREF, MARGIN, NP, PNAME, PSIDE,
*                     PSIZE, ASPECT, DOMAIN, BOX, IPICD, IPICF, IPIC,
*                     IPLOT, NFRM, ALIGN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine opens a graphics device and prepares for graphical
*     output using PGPLOT within a new DATA picture. Optional ancillary
*     pictures around the DATA picture may also be created. A FRAME
*     picture enclosing the DATA picture and any ancillary pictures is
*     created if any ancillary pictures or non-zero margins were
*     requested.
*
*     An AST Plot is returned which allows plotting within the DATA
*     picture. The Base (GRAPHICS) Frame in this Plot corresponds to
*     millimetres from the botttom left corner of the view surface.
*     The Current Frame in the Plot is inherited from the supplied
*     FrameSet (IWCS).
*
*     If there is an existing DATA picture on the device, then the new
*     DATA picture can optionally be aligned with the existing DATA
*     picture. In this case, the returned Plot is formed by adding any
*     supplied FrameSet (IWCS) into the Plot stored with the existing
*     DATA picture in the AGI database (a default Plot is used if the
*     database does not contain a Plot). The FrameSet is added into the
*     Plot by aligning them in the Current Frame of the FrameSet if
*     possible. If this is not possible, they are aligned in the world
*     co-ordinate system of the picture (stored in the AGI database).
*     The Domain of the AGI world co-ordinate system is not stored in
*     the database and must be supplied by the calling application using
*     argument DOMAIN (this will usually be "PIXEL"). If alignment is
*     not possible in AGI world co-ordinates, then they are aligned in
*     the GRID domain. If this is also not possible, they are aligned in
*     any suitable Frame.
*
*     On exit, the current PGPLOT viewport corresponds to area occupied
*     by the new DATA picture. The bounds of the PGPLOT window produce a
*     world co-ordinate system within the viewport corresponding to the
*     Base Frame in the returned Plot (i.e. millimetres from the
*     bottom-left corner of the view surface - NOT pixel co-ordinates).
*     Note, this is different from the world co-ordinate system stored
*     in the AGI database with the new DATA picture.
*
*     If the returned Plot contains an AXIS Frame in which the axes are
*     scaled and shifted versions of the axes of the AGI world
*     co-ordinate Frame (specified by argument DOMAIN), then a
*     TRANSFORM structure is stored with the new DATA picture that
*     defines AGI Data co-ordinates. This is purely for the benefit of
*     non-AST based applications which may use AGI Data co-ordinates
*     (AST-based applications should always use the Plot stored with the
*     picture in preference to the TRANSFORM structure stored in the AGI
*     database).
*
*     Various environment parameters are used to obtain options, etc.
*     The names of these parameters are hard-wired into this subroutine
*     in order to ensure conformity between applications.

*  Environment Parameters:
*     CLEAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the graphics device is to be cleared on opening. See
*        argument STAT.
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The plotting device.
*     FILL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the supplied aspect ratio is to be ignored, creating
*        the largest possible DATA picture within the current picture.
*        When FILL is FALSE, the DATA picture is created with the
*        supplied aspect ratio. Only used when creating a new DATA
*        picture.
*     STYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A description of the plotting style required. This the name of
*        a text file containing an AST attribute setting on each line,
*        of the form "name=value", where "name" is an AST Plot
*        attribute name (or synonym recognised by this application--see
*        KPG1_ASPSY), and "value" is the value to assign to the
*        attribute.
*     TEMPSTYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of extra attribute settings which modify the plotting
*        style specified by the STYLE parameter.  This parameter has the
*        same value options as STYLE, however style changes specified
*        using TEMPSTYLE do not persist between invocations of this
*        routine.

*  Arguments:
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to a FrameSet. This may be AST__NULL. The
*        Current and Base Frames are unchanged on exit.
*     STAT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Determines whether or not the new DATA picture should be
*        aligned with an existing DATA picture.
*
*        - "NEW" -- no attempt is made to align the new DATA picture
*        with an existing DATA picture, even if the CLEAR parameter is
*        given a FALSE value.
*
*        - "OLD" -- the new DATA picture is always aligned with an
*        existing DATA picture. The CLEAR parameter is not accessed (it
*        is assumed to have a FALSE value) and an error is reported if
*        no DATA picture is available.
*
*        - "UNKNOWN" -- If CLEAR is given a FALSE value then the new
*        DATA picture is aligned with any existing DATA picture, but no
*        error is reported if no DATA picture exists.
*     APP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the calling application, in the form
*        <package>_<application> (e.g. "KAPPA_DISPLAY",
*        "POLPACK_POLPLOT", etc.). The supplied string is stored as a
*        comment with all new AGI pictures.
*     DATREF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A string describing the source of the data being displayed,
*        which will be stored in the AGI database with the new DATA
*        picture. It is ignore if blank.
*     MARGIN( 4 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The width of the borders to leave around the new DATA picture,
*        given as fractions of the corresponding dimension of the DATA
*        picture. These should be supplied in the order bottom, right,
*        top, left.
*     NP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of extra pictures to be included in the FRAME
*        pictures (the DATA picture itself is not included in this
*        list). Margins are left around the DATA picture with widths
*        given by MARGIN. Any extra pictures are placed outside these
*        margins, in positions described by PSIDE and PSIZE.
*     PNAME( NP ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The names to store in the AGI database with the NP extra
*        pictures.
*     PSIDE( NP ) = CHARACTER * 1 (Given)
*        Each element of this array should be one of L, R, T or B. It
*        indicates which side of the FRAME picture an extra picture is
*        to be placed. For Left and Right, the extra picture occupies
*        the full height of the DATA picture, margins, and any
*        previously created extra pictures. The picture is placed at the
*        far Left or Right of all previously created pictures. For Top
*        or Bottom, the extra picture occupies the full width of the
*        DATA picture, margins, and any previously created extra
*        pictures. The picture is placed at the top or bottom of all
*        previously created pictures. Ignored if NP is zero.
*     PSIZE( NP ) = REAL (Given)
*        The size of each extra picture. For Left and Right pictures,
*        this is the width of the picture, and the value is given as a
*        fraction of the width of the DATA picture. For Top and Bottom
*        pictures, it is the height of the picture, and it is given as a
*        fraction of the height of the DATA picture. Ignored if NP is
*        zero.
*     ASPECT = REAL (Given)
*        The aspect ratio for the DATA picture. This is the height of
*        the DATA picture (in millimetres) divided by the width of the
*        DATA picture (also in millimetres). The new DATA picture is
*        created with this aspect ratio unless the FILL parameter is
*        given a TRUE value, in which case the aspect ratio is adjusted
*        to get the largest DATA picture that can be created within the
*        current picture. If a value of zero is supplied, then the
*        largest DATA picture is used irrespective of FILL (which is
*        then not accessed).
*     DOMAIN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The Domain name corresponding to the AGI world co-ordinates. If
*        a blank value is supplied then "AGI_WORLD" will be used.
*     BOX( 4 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The co-ordinates to be assigned to the bottom-left, and
*        top-right corners of the DATA picture in the AGI database (the
*        co-ordinate system in defined by argument DOMAIN). Only used if
*        the new DATA picture is NOT being aligned with an existing DATA
*        picture. Supplied in the order XLEFT, YBOTTOM, XRIGHT, YTOP.
*        Note, the supplied bounds are stored in the AGI database, but
*        do not effect the PGPLOT window on exit, which always has a
*        world co-ordinate system of millimetres from the bottom-left
*        corner of the view surface. If the supplied box has zero area,
*        then world co-ordinates for the DATA picture in the AGI
*        database will be centimetres from the bottom-left corner of
*        the DATA picture.
*     IPICD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AGI identifier for the new DATA picture.
*     IPICF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AGI identifier for the new FRAME picture. World co-ordinate
*        system is inherited from the current picture on entry. If no
*        FRAME picture is created then an identifier for the current
*        picture on entry is returned.
*     IPIC( NP ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An array of AGI identifiers corresponding to the extra pictures
*        requested in PSIDE and PSIZE. The world co-ordinate system for
*        each picture is inherited from the FRAME picture. The actual
*        size of a picture may be less than the requested size if there
*        is insufficient room left in the FRAME picture to give it its
*        requested size. Identifiers for pictures which would have zero
*        size (i.e. fall completely outside the FRAME picture) are
*        returned equal to -1, but no error is reported.
*     IPLOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AST pointer to the new Plot. Returned equal to AST__NULL if
*        an error occurs.
*     NFRM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A  Frame with index I in the supplied FrameSet (IWCS) will have
*        index ( I + NFRM ) in the returned Plot (IPLOT). Returned equal
*        to zero if an error occurs.
*     ALIGN = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Was the new DATA picture aligned with an existing DATA picture?
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Picture identifiers are returned equal to -1 if an error
*     occurs, or if any pictures cannot be created.
*     -  Close down AGI and PGPLOT using:
