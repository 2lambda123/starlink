      SUBROUTINE KPG1_HRCPR( M, N, BADVAL, D, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_HRCPx
 
*  Purpose:
*     Finds the reciprocal of a purely real Hermitian image
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_HRCPx( M, N, BADVAL, D, STATUS )
 
*  Description:
*     This routine replaces the supplied Hermitian image with one in
*     which the real terms have been inverted (i.e. replaced by their
*     reciprocal) and the imaginary terms have been set to zero.
*
*     To form 1/H where H is a general complex Hermitian image, the
*     numerator and denominator are both multiplied by the complex
*     conjugate of H ("H*").  The denominator then becomes purely real
*     and equal to the modulus squared of H.  The reciprocal of the
*     denominator is then taken using this routine and the resulting
*     array is multiplied by H*.  Thus the steps are:
*
*     1) Call KPG1_HCONx to form H*, the complex conjugate of H.
*     2) Call KPG1_HMLTx to multiply H by H*.  This gives a purely real
*        image holding the squared modulus of H.
*     3) Call KPG1_HRCPx to take the reciprocal of H.H*.
*     4) Call KPG1_HMLTx to multiply the reciprocal of H.H* by H*.
 
*  Arguments:
*     M = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of columns in the Hermitian image D.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines in the Hermitian image D.
*     BADVAL = ? (Given)
*        A value to return instead of the reciprocal of the real term,
*        if any real term is zero.
*     D( M, N ) = ? (Given and Returned)
*        On entry, a purely real Hermitian image.  On exit, an
*        Hermitian image representing the reciprocal of the supplied
*        image (also purely real).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
 
*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for the double precision and real data
*     types: replace "x" in the routine names by D or R as appropriate.
*     The BADVAL and D arguments must have the data type specified.
