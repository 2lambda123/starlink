      SUBROUTINE KPG1_AXTYP( NDF, COMP, ATYPE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_AXTYP

*  Purpose:
*     Determines the implementation type for NDF axis arrays.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_AXTYP( NDF, COMP, ATYPE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine returns the highest precision required to process
*     the NDF axis component in all dimensions.  '_DOUBLE' is returned
*     if any of the arrays have type '_INTEGER' or 'DOUBLE'.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     COMP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the axis array component whose implementation type
*        is required: 'CENTRE', 'VARIANCE', or 'WIDTH'.
*     ATYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The implementation type of the axis arrays.  It is in uppercase
*        and is either '_REAL' or '_DOUBLE'.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The NDF identifier must be valid and there must be an axis
*     structure.
