      SUBROUTINE KPG1_HSTQ<T>( BAD, EL, INARR, NUMBIN, OLDHST, MAP,

*  Name:
*     KPG1_HSTQx

*  Purpose:
*     Equalises the histogram of an array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_HSTQx( BAD, EL, INARR, NUMBIN, OLDHST, MAP, OUTARR,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine equalises (linearises) the histogram of an array.
*     Thus approximately equal numbers of different values appear in
*     output equalised version of the input array.

*  Arguments:
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true there may be bad values within the input array.  If
*        false there are no bad values.  It is used as an efficiency
*        mechanism.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimension of the arrays.
*     INARR( EL ) = ? (Given)
*        The array to be equalised.
*     NUMBIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of bins used in histogram.  A moderately large number of
*        bins is recommended so that there is little artifactual
*        quantisation is introduced, say a few thousand except for
*        byte data.
*     OLDHST( NUMBIN ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The histogram of the input array, i.e. before equalisation.
*     MAP( NUMBIN ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Key to transform the input histogram's bin number to the
*        equalised bin number after histogram mapping.
*     OUTARR( EL ) = ? (Returned)
*        The array containing the equalised values.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric data type: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as appropriate. The
*     arrays supplied to and returned from this routine must have the
*     data type specified.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Get maximum and minimum values in array.  Generate the
*     histogram of the input array.  Initialise cumulative probability
*     variable
*     -  For all bins in the histogram: calculate current bin
*     probability and the cumulative probability; work out the
*     corresponding equalised histogram bin number; and set the key
*     element accordingly to record the mapped bin number.
*     -  Remap the input array according to the key.
