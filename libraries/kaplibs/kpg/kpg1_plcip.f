      SUBROUTINE KPG1_PLCIP( COLOUR, COLIND, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_PLCIP

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the nearest colour in the palette to a named colour
*     (PGPLOT version of KPG1_PALCI).

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PLCIP( COLOUR, COLIND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine finds the PGPLOT colour index within the palette of a
*     named colour.  The required colour must be in the standard colour
*     set, and SAI__ERROR status is returned if it is not.  If the
*     named colour is not present the index of the colour nearest to
*     the requested colour is returned.  A city-block metric is used.
*
*     A close colour is only accepted if the close colour is not equal
*     to the background colour.  This avoids pens becoming invisible.

*  Arguments:
*     COLOUR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the colour whose colour index is required.
*        Note at least eighteen characters are required to avoid
*        truncation.  The name may be abbreviated.  If there is any
*        ambiguity, the first match (in alphabetical order) is selected.
*     COLIND = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The colour index within the palette of the colour or its
*        nearest equivalent.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  A PGPLOT image-display workstation must be open and active.

*     1991 July 19 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     27-FEB-1998 (DSB):
*        Changed for use with PGPLOT instead of GKS.  Re-formatted to
*        modern style.
*     9-JUN-1999 (DSB):
*        Avoid accepting close colours which are equal to the background
*        colour, and thus invisible.
