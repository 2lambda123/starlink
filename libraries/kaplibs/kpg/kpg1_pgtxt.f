      SUBROUTINE KPG1_PGTXT( ANGLE, TEXT, X, Y, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_PGTXT

*  Purpose:
*     Draw text using PGPLOT and return concatenation point.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PGTXT( ANGLE, TEXT, X, Y, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine plots the supplied text at a given angle using 
*     PGPLOT, putting the bottom left corner of the text at the 
*     supplied position. The position at which another string must be
*     drawn to concatenate it with the string just drawn is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     ANGLE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The angle, in degrees, that the baseline is to make with the 
*        horizontal, increasing anti-clockwise (0.0 is horizontal).
*     TEXT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The text to draw. The returned values of X and Y leave room for
*        any trailing spaces, UNLESS THE ENTIRE STRING IS BLANK, IN WHICH
**       CASE X AND Y ARE RETURNED UNCHANGED.
*     X = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The X position for the bottom left corner of the string.
*        On exit, it is the X position at the bottom of the a string
*        to be concatenated to the one just drawn.
*     Y = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The Y position for the bottom left corner of the string.
*        On exit, it is the Y position at the bottom of the a string
*        to be concatenated to the one just drawn.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Make this longer to include any trailing spaces in the supplied text.

*  Return the concatenation point.
