      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ABSET( SEPAR, OPTS, ARRAY, NELM, MCH, MINCH,
     :                       MAXNOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ABSET

*  Purpose:
*     Separates a list of items into a character array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ABSET( SEPAR, OPTS, ARRAY, NELM, MINCH, MAXNOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine separates a list of items into an character array and
*     finds the minimum number of characters required to specify each
*     item uniquely, and the length in characters of the longest item
*     of the list.

*  Arguments:
*     SEPAR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The separator that divides the list of items.
*     OPTS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Contains a list of items separated by the delimiter SEPAR.  It
*        is limited to 132 characters.
*     ARRAY( * ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The list divided into an array of values.  The list is in
*        alphabetic order.
*     NELM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of elements in the list, and stored in ARRAY.
*     MCH( * ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The minimum number of initial characters to identify each of
*        the items in the list uniquely.  In the special case when an
*        option equals the start of another option, MCH for the first
*        option equals the option's length (ignoring trailing blanks)
*        in characters; MCH for the the second will be at least one
*        character greater.
*     MINCH = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The minimum number of initial characters that can identify an
*        item in the list uniquely.  In other words, the minimum value
*        of the elements of MCH.
*     MAXNOC = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The maximum length of an item in the array, ignoring trailing
*        blanks.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The size and dimension of the character array must be
*        sufficient to accommodate the length and number of strings.
*     -  Error status SAI__ERROR is returned when the list of options
*        is ambiguous.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Extract the items from the list and place in an array, and
*        compute the length of the longest item.  It uses an offset
*        within the list to find each separator in turn. Allow for the
*        special case when the list is terminated by the separator.
*     -  If the list contains more than one item then
*        o  Sort the array in alphabetic order
*        o  Loop for all elements, comparing with the two adjacent
*           elements, first starting at one character and increasing
*           until there is no match or the number of initial characters
*           exceeds the length of the item. In the latter case abort
*           if the options are the same, but decrement the length
*           counter if not and continue.
*        o  Take the maximum of the two numbers of initial characters
*           unless the first and last in the list where the comparison
*           is only with the second and penultimate elements
*           respectively.
*     -  Otherwise set the minimum number of characters to 1.

*     1991 January 2 (MJC):
*        Original version based on AIF_ABSET.
*     1991 June 24 (MJC):
*        Made to cope with the special case when an option in full
*        equals the start of another option, e.g. integers.
*     1992 February 29 (MJC):
