F77_SUBROUTINE(kpg1_ptfts)( INTEGER(INDF), INTEGER(FCHAN), INTEGER(STATUS) ) {
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_PTFTS

*  Purpose:
*     Store FITS header information into an NDF

*  Language:
*     C, designed to be called from Fortran.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PTFTS( INDF, FCHAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine stores the contents of an AST FitsChan into an
*     NDF by creating (or replacing) the FITS extension in the NDF.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier of NDF to receive the .FITS extension.
*     FCHAN = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to a FitsChan which contains information about
*        the FITS header to be associated with the NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - If a .MORE.FITS extension already exists it will be completely
*     replaced by this routine.
