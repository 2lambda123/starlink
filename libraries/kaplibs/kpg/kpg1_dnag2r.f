      SUBROUTINE KPG1_DNAG2R( NP, R, WORK )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_DNAG2R

*  Purpose:
*     Converts an NAG Hermitian Fourier transform array into an array
*     usable by FFTPACK routine KPG1_DRFFTB.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_DNAG2R( NP, R, WORK )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine modifies the supplied array of Fourier co-efficients
*     (as produced by NAG subroutine C06FAF) so that an inverse FFT can be
*     performed on them using FFTPACK routine KPG1_DRFFTB. The resulting inverse
*     will have the same normalisation as the original data transformed
*     using KPG1_DRFFTF.
*
*     This function is equivalent to PDA_NAG2R except that it uses work
*     space for greater speed.

*  Arguments:
*     NP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the array.
*     R( NP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        The array holding the Fourier co-efficients. Supplied in NAG
*        format and returned in FFTPACK format.
*     WORK( NP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Work space.

*  Notes:
*     -  A call to KPG1_DR2NAG followed by a call to KPG1_DNAG2R will result in
*     the original data being divided by NP.

      IMPLICIT NONE              ! No implicit typing

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER NP

*  Arguments Given and Returned:

*  Local Variables:

*  Scale the remaining real terms and store in the work array.

*  Scale the imaginary terms and store in the work array.
