      SUBROUTINE CREOUT( PARNAM, TLENAM, NDIM, DIMS, LOCAT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CREOUT

*  Purpose:
*     creates and returns a locator to an IMAGE type structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CREOUT( PARNAM, LABNAM, NDIM, DIMS, LOCAT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An IMAGE-type data structure, associated with the parameter name
*     in PARNAM, is created. A locator for this structure is returned
*     in LOCAT. A TITLE component, associated with the parameter name in
*     TLENAM, is created within the structure and a character value,
*     up to 72 characters long, is obtained from the parameter system
*     and written to the TITLE component. A DATA_ARRAY component is
*     created, this has dimensionality NDIM and dimensions DIMS( NDIM )
*     and is of type _REAL.
*     An immediate return will occur if STATUS has an error value on
*     entry.

*  Arguments:
*     PARNAM = CHAR*(*)( READ )
*        Parameter name associated with the IMAGE type structure to
*        be created.
*     TLENAM = CHAR*(*)( READ )
*        Parameter name associated with the TITLE component created
*        in the new IMAGE-type structure.
*     NDIM   = INTEGER( READ )
*        Dimensionality of the DATA_ARRAY component of the new
*        IMAGE-type structure.
*     DIMS( NDIM ) = INTEGER( READ )
*        Dimensions of the DATA_ARRAY component of the new IMAGE-type
*        structure.
*     LOCAT  = CHAR*(*)( WRITE )
*        Locator to the new IMAGE-type structure.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*        This is the global status, if this variable has an error
*        value on entry then an immediate return will occur. If an
*        error occurs during the execution of this routine STATUS
*        will be returned containing the appropriate error value.

*  Algorithm:
*     If no error on entry then
*        Create a new IMAGE-type data structure associated with the
*          parameter name PARNAM.
*        Get a locator, LOCAT, to this IMAGE-type structure.
*        If no errors so far then
*           Get a character string associated with parameter name TLENAM
*           If reponse was not null then
*              Write this character string to the structure as TITLE
*                component.
*           Endif
*           Create a DATA_ARRAY component of dimensions DIMS( NDIM ).
*           If error has occured while creating TITLE or DATA_ARRAY then
*              Annul the locator LOCAT
*           Endif
*        Endif
*     Endif
