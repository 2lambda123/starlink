      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ARCOG( PARAM, INDF, MCOMP, COMP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ARCOG

*  Purpose:
*     Allow the user to select an array component in a supplied NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ARCOG( PARAM, INDF, MCOMP, COMP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine allows the user to select an NDF array component 
*     selected from the ones available in the supplied NDF. Any of 
*     'Data', 'Quality', 'Variance', and 'Error' can be selected if 
*     they are present in the NDF. The user is re-prompted until a
*     valid component name is obtained, or an error occurs.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter to use.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     MCOMP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The name of the selected array component for use with NDF_MAP. 
*        The  returned values are 'Data', 'Quality', 'Variance', and 
*        'Error' for the array components DATA, QUALITY, VARIANCE, and 
*        ERROR respectively. Returned equal to 'Data' if an error occurs.
*     COMP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        Equal to MCOMP except that 'Variance' is substituted in place of
*        'Error'. Only NDF_MAP accepts 'Error' as a component name. All
*        other NDF routines require 'Variance' to be specified instead
*        and so should use COMP instead of MCOMP.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Most NDF routines with a component argument don't recognise

*  of the few routines that does support 'Error' is NDF_MAP.

*  Flush the error.
            CALL ERR_FLUSH( STATUS )

*  Cancel the parameter value.
            CALL PAR_CANCL( PARAM, STATUS )

*  If a usable component name was obtained, or an error occurred, quit
*  looping.
