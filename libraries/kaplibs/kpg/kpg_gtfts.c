F77_SUBROUTINE(kpg_gtfts)( INTEGER(INDF), INTEGER(FCHAN), INTEGER(STATUS) ) {

*  Name:
*     KPG_GTFTS

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain FITS header information from an NDF

*  Language:
*     C, designed to be called from Fortran.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG_GTFTS( INDF, FCHAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine reads the FITS extension from an NDF and returns an
*     AST pointer to a FitsChan which contains this information. The
*     information may then be accessed using routines from the AST
*     library (SUN/211).

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        NDF identifier.
*     FCHAN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AST pointer to a FitsChan which contains information about
*        the FITS headers associated with the NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - It is the caller's responsibility to annul the AST pointer
*     issued by this routine (e.g. by calling AST_ANNUL) when it is no
*     longer required.
*     - If this routine is called with STATUS set, then a value of
*     AST__NULL will be returned for the FCHAN argument, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be
*     returned if the routine should fail for any reason.
*     - Status is set to KPG__NOFTS if no FITS extension is found.
