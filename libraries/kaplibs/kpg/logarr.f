      SUBROUTINE LOGARR( INARR, DIMS, BASE, OUTARR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     LOGARR

*  Purpose:
*     take the logarithm of an array, pixel by pixel.

*  Language:
*     Starlink

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LOGARR( INARR, DIMS, BASE, OUTARR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine fills the output array pixels with the results
*     of taking the logarithm of the pixels of the input array
*     to the base specified, i.e. New value = Log    ( Old value ).
*                                                Base
*     If the input pixel is negative, then a bad pixel value is
*     used for the output value.
*     To find the logarithm to any base, the following algorithm
*     is used, providing the base is positive and not equal to one :
*      New Value  =  Log ( Old Value ) / Log ( Base )
*                       e                   e

*  Arguments:
*     INARR( DIMS )  =  REAL( READ )
*        Array containing input image data
*     DIMS  =  INTEGER( READ )
*        Dimensions of input and output arrays
*     BASE  =  REAL( READ )
*        Base of logarithm to be used - must be a positive number
*     OUTARR( DIMS )  =  REAL( WRITE )
*        Array containing results of processing input data
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER( READ )
*        Global status value

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - if o.k. reurn immediately
*     If input base is positive and not equal to one
*        Work out factor which defines the base we are working in
*         - factor = 1/loge( base)
*        For all pixels of output array
*           If Inarray value is positive then
*              Outarray value  =  loge( Inarray value ) / factor
*           Else
*              Outarray value  =  bad value
*           Endif
*        Endfor
*     Else base is negative or equal to one
*        For all pixels of output array
*           Outarray value  =  bad value
*        Endfor
*     Endif
*     Return

*  History:
*     03-07-1986 :  First implementation (REVA::MJM)
*     1986 Aug 12:  Renamed from LOGARR2D, generalised to any array,
*        completed prologue and nearly conformed to
*        Starlink standards (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1986 Sep 2 :  Renamed parameters -> arguments section in prologue
*        and added bad-pixel handling (RL.CUR::STAR).
*     {enter_further_changes_here}

*  Bugs:
*     None known.
