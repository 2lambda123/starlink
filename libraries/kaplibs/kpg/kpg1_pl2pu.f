*  Name:
*     KPG1_PL2PU

*  Purpose:
*     Writes 2-dimensional polynomial information to a POLYNOMIAL
*     structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PL2PU( LOC, VARNT, NXPAR, NYPAR, LIMITS, XMIN, XMAX,
*                      YMIN, YMAX, COEFF, VARIAN, WORK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine writes information describing a two-dimensional
*     polynomial surface to a standard Starlink POLYNOMIAL structure,
*     as defined in SGP/38.  An empty POLYNOMIAL structure should
*     already have been created.  All floating point components within
*     the structure are written as DOUBLE PRECISION.
*
*     It is assumed the calling programme has a one-dimensional array of
*     coefficients, where COEFF( ( IX - 1 ) * NYPAR + IY ) contains the
*     coefficient for the (IX,IY)th term (with NYPAR being the total
*     number of Y terms).  Such a one-dimensional array is used by the
*     NAG routines and defined in the NAG manual (see Chapter E02 on
*     "Curve and Surface fitting").
*
*     This routine will convert the coefficient array to 
*     two-dimensional, flip it around and store it in the POLYNOMIAL 
*     structure so that DATA_ARRAY(IX,IY) contains the coefficient for 
*     the (IX,IY)th term (see SGP/38).
*
*     The routine will also load the TMIN and TMAX arrays with XMIN,
*     XMAX, YMIN and YMAX.  Note that these are compulsory when
*     VARNT='CHEBYSHEV' but optional when VARNT='SIMPLE'.  In the latter
*     case the logical parameter LIMITS will be used to decide whether
*     to write the limits.  All the components have type _DOUBLE.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given)
*        Locator to existing but empty POLYNOMIAL structure.
*     VARNT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Variant of the polynomial ('CHEBYSHEV' or 'SIMPLE').  (This is
*        written but not checked).
*     NXPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of x parameters (= order of polynomial in x direction +
*        1)
*     NYPAR  = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of y parameters (= order of polynomial in y direction +
*        1)
*     LIMITS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        When VARNT='SIMPLE' this logical flag may be used to control
*        whether the TMIN and TMAX limits are written to the polynomial
*        structure (based on the next 4 arguments).  Setting
*        LIMITS=.TRUE. will cause the limits to be written.  This
*        parameter is ignored when VARNT='CHEBYSHEV', as the limits
*        then are compulsory.
*     XMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Minimum value along x axis for which polynomial is valid.
*     XMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Maximum value along x axis for which polynomial is valid.
*     YMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Minimum value along y axis for which polynomial is valid.
*     YMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Maximum value along y axis for which polynomial is valid.
*     COEFF( NXPAR * NYPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Array of polynomial coefficients, in the format used by NAG
*        routines.
*     VARIAN( NXPAR * NYPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Array of variances of polynomial coefficients, in the format
*        used by NAG routines.
*     WORK( NXPAR, NYPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Work array used to flip the polynomial coefficients.  On exit
*        it will contain the two-dimensional array of coefficients
*        written to the POLYNOMIAL structure.
*     STATUS =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.

*  Notes:
*     -  Uses the magic-value method for bad or undefined pixels.

*  History:
*     22-Apr-1993 (SMB):
*        Original version.
*     23-Apr-1993 (SMB):
*        DAT_PAR included (commented out) so the routine can work
*       in a UNIX environment.
*     6-May-1993 (SMB):
*        DAT_PAR does not need to be commented out.
*     10-May-1993 (SMB):
*        I had mis-understood the meaning of the arguments of
*        CMP_PUTND. Now corrected.
*     1995 July 30 (MJC):
*        Renamed from PLYGET2D.  Used modern prologue and style.
*     1997 May 10 (MJC):
*        Added VARIAN argument, and improved the documentation.
