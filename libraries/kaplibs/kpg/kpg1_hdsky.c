*  Name:
*     KPG1_HDSKY

*  Purpose:
*     Append a primitive HDS object to an AST KeyMap.

*  Language:
*     C, designed to be called from Fortran.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_HDSKY( LOC, KEYMAP, OLD, NEW, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This function stores the vectorised data values in the supplied HDS 
*     object (which must be primitive) in the supplied KeyMap. The key for 
*     the KeyMap entry is the name of the HDS object. If the KeyMap already
*     contains an entry with this name, then what happens is specified 
*     by OLD. Likewise, if the KeyMap does not already contain an entry 
*     with this name, then what happens is specified by NEW. 

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given)
*        An HDS locator for a primitive scalar or array object.
*     KEYMAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to an existing KeyMap.
*     OLD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Specifies what happens if the supplied KeyMap already contains
*        an entry with the name of the supplied HDS object.
*
*        1 - Append the new vectorised array values read from the HDS
*        object to the end of the values already in the KeyMap. The HDS
*        values will be converted to the data type of the values already 
*        in the KeyMap (an error will be reported if this is not possible).
*
*        2 - Replace the existing KeyMap entry with a new entry holding
*        the vectorised array values read from the HDS object.
*
*        3 - Do nothing. The KeyMap is returned unchanged, and no error
*        is reported.
*
*        4 - Report an error. The KeyMap is returned unchanged, and an error
*        is reported.
*     NEW = INTEGER (Given)
*        Specifies what happens if the supplied KeyMap does not already 
*        contain an entry with the name of the supplied HDS object.
*
*        1 - Create a new entry holding the vectorised array values read from 
*        the HDS object.
*
*        2 - Do nothing. The KeyMap is returned unchanged, and no error
*        is reported.
*
*        3 - Report an error. The KeyMap is returned unchanged, and an error
*        is reported.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - An error is reported if the supplied HDS object is a structure.
