      SUBROUTINE KPG1_FLCOR( PNAME, NDIM, POSCOD, NPOINT, IPCO,
     :                         LBND, UBND, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_FLCOx
 
*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a list of co-ordinates from a text file.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_FLCOx( PNAME, NDIM, POSCOD, NPOINT, IPCO, LBND, UBND,
*                      STATUS )
 
*  Description:
*     This routine obtains a list of n-dimensional co-ordinates for a
*     series of positions.  The text file should contain on each line
*     a set of free-format co-ordinates that defines a position, except
*     for comment lines denoted by a hash or shriek in column 1.
*     The file is opened using the supplied parameter.  A pass is made
*     through the file to see how many records it contains.  Dynamic
*     workspace is reserved to contain the co-ordinates, and the file
*     is then rewound.  Another pass is made through the file to read
*     the co-ordinate values which are then stored in the workspace.
*     Pointers to the workspace are returned.  This workspace should be
*     released by calling PSX_FREE when it is no longer needed.
 
*  Arguments:
*     PNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Name of the parameter with which to associate the text file.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of co-ordinate dimensions to read from the text
*        file.
*     POSCOD( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The column numbers of the co-ordinate information in order
*        x, y, z, etc.  These must be positive.
*     NPOINT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of co-ordinate sets specified in the text file.
*     IPCO = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to workspace of type _REAL and size NDIM by NPOINT
*        holding the NDIM co-ordinates of each point.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = ? (Returned)
*        The lower bounds of the input data, i.e. the minimum value for
*        each co-ordinate.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = ? (Returned)
*        The upper bounds of the input data, i.e. the maximum value for
*        each co-ordinate.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
 
*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each of the real or double-precision
*     data types: replace "x" in the routine name by R or D
*     respectively, as appropriate.  The returned co-ordinate array
*     will have this type, and the supplied bounds arrays should also
*     have the specified data type.
*     -  The number of points read from the file is reported at the
*     normal reporting level.

*  History:
*     11-NOV-1993 (DSB):
*        Original version based on MJC's code in SEGMENT.
*     1995 April 11 (MJC):
*        Made generic, n-dimensional, and renamed from KPS1_FLXYR.
*        Added POSCOD and bounds arguments, and message reporting.
