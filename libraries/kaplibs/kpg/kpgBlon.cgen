*  Name:
*     kpgBlon<T>

*  Purpose:
*     Smooths an n-dimensional image using box filter.

*  Synopsis:
*     void kpgBlon<T>( int bad, int sambad, int var, int ndim,
*                      const int dims[], const CGEN_TYPE a[],
*                      const int ibox[], int nlim, int wdim, CGEN_TYPE b[],
*                      int *badout, CGEN_TYPE asum[], int nsum[], int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function smooths an n-dimensional array using an n-dimensional
*     box filter; each pixel is replaced by the mean of those good
*     neighbours which lie within a box of specified size.

*  Parameters:
*     bad
*        Whether it is necessary to check for bad pixels in the input
*        image.
*     sambad
*        If a non-zero value is given for this parameter, then bad input
*        pixels will be propagated to the output image unchanged (a
*        smoothed output value will be calculated for all other pixels). If
*        a zero value is given, then the "nlim" parameter determines
*        whether an output pixel is good or bad.  The value of "sambad" is
*        not relevant if "bad" is zero.
*     var
*        If a zero value is given for this parameter, then the smoothing
*        applied will be appropriate to a data image. If a non-zero value
*        is given, then the smoothing will be appropriate to an image
*        containing variance values. In the latter case the output values
*        will be (on average) smaller than the input values to take account
*        of the variance-reducing effect which smoothing produces.
*     ndim
*        The number of dimensions of the array to be smoothed.
*     dims
*        The dimensions of the array to be smoothed. The supplied "dims"
*        array should have at least "ndim" elements.
*     a
*        Input array to be smoothed.  Its dimensions are given by parameter
*        "dims".
*     ibox
*        Half-size of the smoothing box in pixels along eeach axis (the
*        actual size of the ith axis's box used will be 2*"ibox"(i)+1
*        pixels). The supplied "ibox" array should have at least "ndim"
*        elements.
*     nlim
*        Minimum number of good pixels which must be present in the
*        smoothing box in order to calculate a smoothed output pixel. If
*        this minimum number is not satisfied, then a bad output pixel will
*        result. "a" value between 1 and the total number of pixels in the
*        smoothing box should be supplied.
*     wdim
*        The dimension of the "asum" and "nsum" workspaces.  It must be at
*        least 1 + "dims"( 1 ) for a two-dimensional array , and at least 1
*        + ( "dims"(1) * ... ( 1 + "dims"("ndim"-1) ) ... ) for an
*        "ndim"-dimensional array.  For example a 20x16x27-element array
*        would need WLIM not fewer than 1+(20*(1+16)=341 elements.
*     b
*        Returned holding the smoothed output array.  It has the same
*        dimensions as "a".
*     *badout
*        Returned holding the whether bad pixels are present in the output
*        image.
*     asum
*        Returned holding the workspace for the pixel sums. The supplied
*        "asum" array should have at least "wdim" elements.
*     nsum
*        Returned holding the workspace for counting good pixels. The
*        supplied "nsum" array should have at least "wdim" elements.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a function for processing single- and double-precision
*     arrays; replace "x" in the function name by R or D as appropriate.
*     The data type of the "a", "b" and "asum" arguments must match the
*     function used.
*     -  The function uses recursion of the standard filter algorithm for
*     each dimension moving from the highest to lowest. Recursion ends when
*     there is only the integrated value and the corresponding number of
*     contributing pixels sums used to find the output smoothed value for
*     the current element of the input array.  At each dimension the filter
*     box is initialised with the required number of values for the box
*     width, and then as the function progresses through each position in
*     the current dimension a new section is incorporated into the
*     summations, while a section leaving the box is subtracted.
