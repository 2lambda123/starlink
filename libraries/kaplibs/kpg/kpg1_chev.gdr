      SUBROUTINE KPG1_CHEV<T>( XMIN, XMAX, NCOEF, CHCOEF, NPTS, X,

*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_CHEVx

*  Purpose:
*     Evaluates a one-dimensional Chebyshev polynomial.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_CHEVx( XMIN, XMAX, NCOEF, CHCOEF, NPTS, X, EVAL,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine evaluates a one-dimensional Chebyshev polynomial for
*     one or more arguments.  It uses Clenshaw's recurrence
*     relationship.

*  Arguments:
*     XMIN = ? (Given)
*        The lower endpoint of the range of the fit.  The Chebyshev
*        series representation is in terms of a normalised variable,
*        evaluated as ( 2x - (XMAX + XMIN) ) / (XMAX - XMIN), where x
*        is the original variable.  XMIN must be less than XMAX.
*     XMAX = ? (Given)
*        The upper endpoint of the range of the fit.  See XMIN.
*     NCOEF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of coefficients.  This must be at least the
*        polynomial order plus one.
*     CC( NCOEF ) = ? (Given)
*        The Chebyshev coefficients.
*     NPTS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of arguments for which the Chebyshev polynomial is
*        to be evaluated.
*     X( NPTS ) = ? (Given)
*        The arguments for which the Chebyshev polynomial is to be
*        evaluated.
*     EVAL( NPTS ) = ? (Returned)
*        The evaluated polynomial for the supplied arguments.  Should an
*        argument lie beyond the range [XMIN,XMAX], the bad value is
*        returned in the corresponding element of EVAL.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  [optional_subroutine_items]...
*  Notes:
*     There is a routine for the real and double precision data types:
*     replace "x" in the routine name by R or D respectively.  The
*     XMIN, XMAX, CC, X, and EVAL arguments supplied to the routine
*     must have the data type specified.
