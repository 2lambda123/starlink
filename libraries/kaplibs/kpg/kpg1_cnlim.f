      SUBROUTINE KPG1_CNLIM( NOS, FIRST, LAST, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_CNLIM

*  Purpose:
*     Parse a character string into integer bounds.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_CNLIM( NOS, FIRST, LAST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine is used to parse a character specification which
*     defines a range of integers.  The specification is of the form:

*       Number[-number]

*     If the second number is specified then it is assumed that a
*     sequence of numbers are to be parsed, e.g. 4-6 (or 6-4) specifies
*     integers 4, 5, 6; and bounds 4 and 6 are returned.  If only one
*     number is specified, then both the returned bounds are set equal
*     to it.

*     An asterisk may be used as a wildcard.  Thus 5-* specifies all
*     numbers upwards from 5 inclusive, the upper bound being given by
*     the largest integer.  * indicates all integers, i.e. the bounds
*     would be the smallest (non-bad) and largest integers. *-4
*     would specify a range from the smallest integer to 4 inclusive.

*     Arguments:
*      NOS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*          Number specification.
*      FIRST = INTEGER (Returned)
*          First integer in the sequence.
*      LAST  = INTEGER (Returned)
*          Last integer in the sequence.
*      STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*          Global status value.

*     Algorithm:
*        - Find character position of the number separator and wildcard
*        if present. Report an error if the first character is a
*        separator.
*        - If there is no separator and no wildcard convert from
*        character to integer the single value and use for the upper
*        and lower limits.
*        - If there is a separator and the wildcard comes before it
*        set the lower limit to the minimum integer and convert the
*        upper limit.
*        - If there is a separator and the wildcard comes after it
*        set the upper limit to the largest positive integer and
*        convert the lower limit.
*        - If there is a separator and no wildcard determine the first
*        and last numbers either side of the separator by type
*        conversion.  If the first is greater than the last then swap
*        them.
