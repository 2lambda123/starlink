      SUBROUTINE KPG1_GDFND( NAME, IPIC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_GDFND

*  Purpose:
*     Selects the highest picture of a given name with WCS within the
*     current AGI picture.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_GDFND( NAME, IPIC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine searches forwards through the AGI database for a
*     picture of a given name that lies within the current picture and
*     has an associated AST Plot structure. The the current picture
*     itself is included in the search.  If such a picture is found it
*     becomes the new current picture.  Otherwise, a bad status will be
*     returned, and the current picture is unchanged.
*
*     This routine is like KPG1_AGFND except that KPG1_AGFDN does not
*     require the returned picture to have an associated Plot.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the picture to be searched for in the graphics
*        database.
*     IPIC = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The picture identifier of the most-recent picture named NAME.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
