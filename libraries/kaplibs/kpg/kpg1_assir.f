      LOGICAL FUNCTION KPG1_ASSIR( FRM, SCS, PEP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASSIR

*  Purpose:
*     Set the attributes of a SkyFrame to match an IRAS90 SCS.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = KPG1_ASSIR( FRM, SCS, PEP, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine modifies the supplied skyframe so that it describes
*     the celestial co-ordinate system given by the supplied IRAS90 "Sky
*     Co-ordinate System" specified (see SUN/163). A .FALSE. function value
*     is returned if the supplied string is not a valid IRAS90 SCS, but no
*     error is reported.

*  Arguments:
*     FRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to the SkyFrame.
*     SCS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The IRAS90 SCS specifier.
*     PEP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of an environment parameter which can be used to get
*        the epoch of observation.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     KPG1_ASSIR = LOGICAL
*        .TRUE. if the supplied SCS string was a valid IRAS90 Sky
*        Co-ordinate System specifier, and ,FALSE. otherwise.

*  FK4 systems need a qualifying epoch value, and other systems may in
*  the future (eg when ICRS is accept). To be on the safe side, we always
*  get an EPOCH from the user, using the SkyFrame's current value as a
*  default.
