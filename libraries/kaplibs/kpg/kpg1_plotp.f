*  Name:
*     KPG1_PLOTP

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a new DATA picture, with optionally ancillary pictures.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PLOTP( IPICD, APP, MARGIN, NP, PNAME, PSIDE, PSIZE, 
*                      ASPECT, BOX, IPICD0, IPICF, IPIC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine createa a new DATA picture, together with optional 
*     ancillary pictures around the DATA picture. The new DATA picture 
*     can be aligned with an existing DATA picture. A FRAME picture 
*     enclosing the DATA picture and any ancillary pictures is created 
*     if any ancillary pictures or non-zero margins were requested.
*
*     On exit, the current PGPLOT viewport corresponds to area occupied 
*     by the new DATA picture. The bounds of the PGPLOT window produce a 
*     world co-ordinate system within the viewport corresponding to 
*     millimetres from the bottom-left corner of the view surface. Note, 
*     this is different to the world co-ordinate system stored in the AGI 
*     database with the new DATA picture.
*
*     Various environment parameters are used to obtain options, etc. The
*     names of these parameters are hard-wired into this subroutine in
*     order to ensure conformity between applications. 

*  Environment Parameters:
*     FILL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the supplied aspect ratio is to be ignored, creating the 
*        largest possible DATA picture within the current picture.  When 
*        FILL is FALSE, the DATA picture is created with the supplied
*        aspect ratio. Only used when creating a new DATA picture.

*  Arguments:
*     IPICD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The AGI identifier for an existing DATA picture. If this is
*        supplied equal to -1, the size and extent of the new DATA picture 
*        are determined by BOX. Otherwise, the size and extent of the new
*        DATA picture are set equal to the existing DATA picture.
*     APP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the calling application in the form
*        <package>_<application> (eg "KAPPA_DISPLAY").
*     MARGIN( 4 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The width of the borders to leave round the new DATA picture, given
*        as fractions of the corresponding dimension of the DATA picture. 
*        These should be supplied in the order bottom, right, top, left.
*     NP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of extra pictures to be included in the FRAME pictures
*        (the DATA picture itself is not included in this list). Margins are
*        left round the DATA picture with widths given by MARGIN. Any extra 
*        pictures are placed outside these margins, in positions described by 
*        PSIDE and PSIZE. 
*     PNAME( NP ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The names to store in the AGI database with the NP extra pictures.
*     PSIDE( NP ) = CHARACTER * 1 (Given)
*        Each element of this array should be one of L, R, T or B. It
*        indicates which side of the FRAME picture an extra picture is to be
*        placed. For Left and Right, the extra picture occupies the full
*        height of the DATA picture, margins, and any previously created 
*        extra pictures. The picture is placed at the far Left or Right of 
*        all previously created pictures. For Top or Bottom, the extra picture 
*        occupies the full width of the DATA picture, margins, and any 
*        previously created extra pictures. The picture is placed at the top or
*        bottom of all previously created pictures. Ignored if NP is zero.
*     PSIZE( NP ) = REAL (Given)
*        The size of each extra picture. For Left and Right pictures, this is
*        the width of the picture, and the value is given as a fraction
*        of the width of the DATA picture. For Top and Bottom pictures, it is 
*        the height of the picture, and it is given as a fraction of the
*        height of the DATA picture. Ignored if NP is zero.
*     ASPECT = REAL (Given)
*        The aspect ratio for the DATA picture. This is the height of the
*        DATA picture (in millimetres)  divided by the width of the DATA
*        picture (also in millimetres). The new DATA picture is created with 
*        this aspect ratio unless the FILL parameter is given a TRUE value, 
*        in which case the aspect ratio is adjusted to get the largest DATA 
*        picture which can be created within the current picture. If a value 
*        of zero is supplied, then the largest DATA picture is used 
*        irrespective of FILL (which is then not accessed).
*     BOX( 4 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The co-ordinates to be assigned to the bottom-left, and top-right 
*        corners of the DATA picture in the AGI database (the co-ordinate 
*        system in defined by argument DOMAIN). Only used if the new DATA 
*        picture is NOT being aligned with an existing DATA picture. Supplied 
*        in the order XLEFT, YBOTTOM, XRIGHT, YTOP. Note, the supplied
*        bounds are stored in the AGI database, but do not effect the PGPLOT
*        window on exit, which always has a world co-ordinate system of
*        millimetres from the bottom-left corner of the view surface. If
*        the supplied box has zero area, then world co-ordinates for the
*        DATA picture in the AGI database will be centimetres from the
*        bottom-left corner of the DATA picture.
*     IPICD0 = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AGI identifier for the new DATA picture.
*     IPICF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AGI identifier for the new FRAME picture. World co-ordinate system
*        is inherited from the current picture on entry. If no FRAME picture 
*        is created then an identifier for the current picture on entry is
*        returned.
*     IPIC( NP ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An array of AGI identifiers corresponding to the extra pictures
*        requested in ZSIDE and PSIZE. The world co-ordinate system for each
*        picture is inherited from the FRAME picture. The actual size of a 
*        picture may be less than the requested size if there is insufficient 
*        room left in the FRAME picture to give it its requested size. 
*        Identifiers for pictures which would have zero size (i.e. fall 
*        completely outside the FRAME picture) are returned equal to -1, but 
*        no error is reported.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Picture identifiers are returned equal to -1 if the picture cannot 
*     be created (eg due to lack of room within the current picture).
