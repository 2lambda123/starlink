      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ASTTL( IPLOT, IWCS, INDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASTTL

*  Purpose:
*     Set the Title attribute of a Plot.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ASTTL( IPLOT, IWCS, INDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine sets the Title attribute of an AST Plot. The Title
*     string can be obtained from a variety of places, and the following
*     priority order is used:
*
*     The value of the Title attribute supplied by the user via the
*     application's STYLE parameter is given top priority. If no Title
*     was supplied then the Title component of the NDF is used. If this
*     is blank, then the TItle attribute stored in the current Frame of
*     the NDF's WCS FrameSet is used, if it has been set explicitly (i.e. 
*     is not just a default value). Otherwise, the name of the NDF is used.

*  Arguments:
*     IPLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer for the Plot. The Title attribute of the current
*        Frame will be set on exit.
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer for the WCS FrameSet obtained from the NDF.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        An NDF identifier for the NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  First priority is given to values explicitly supplied by the user via
*  the application's STYLE parameter. If such a value was supplied it
*  will currently be assigned to the Title attribute of the Plot. However,
*  simply testing the state of the attribute using AST_TEST will not
*  distinguish between titles supplied via the STYLE parameter a title
*  stored in the  NDF's WCS FrameSet. We assume that if the Title in the
*  Plot is the same as the Title in the WCS FrameSet, then the user has
*  not supplied the Title via the STYLE parameter. If these two titles
*  differ, then return with the Plot unchanged since we will then assume
*  that the Plot's Title was supplied via the STYLE parameter (if the
*  user has explicitly supplied a blank title, then we find a better value).

*  If we still have no title, use the NDF path. Ensure we know the length
*  of the title string.

*  If the NDF path has not been used as the title, see if the NDF path
