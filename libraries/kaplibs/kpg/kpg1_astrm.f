      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ASTRM( IWCS, DEFAX, LBND, UBND, WORK, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASTRM

*  Purpose:
*     Trim axes from the current Frame of a FrameSet.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ASTRM( IWCS, DEFAX, LBND, UBND, WORK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine ensures that the number of axes in the current Frame of 
*     the supplied FrameSet is the same as the number in the base Frame.
*     If this is not the case on entry, a new Frame with the required number 
*     of axes is created and added into the FrameSet and becomes the new 
*     current Frame. 
*
*     If the original current Frame has too few axes, the new Frame is a 
*     copy of the original current frame with extra simple axes added to 
*     the end. These extra axes are supplied a value of AST__BAD by the 
*     Mapping which connects the original current Frame to the new current 
*     Frame.
*
*     If the original current Frame has too many axes, the user is
*     allowed to select a subset of the original axes using the environment
*     parameter USEAXIS (see below). A new Frame is created by picking
*     these selected axes from the original current Frame. This Frame is
*     added into the FrameSet using a Mapping which has a forward
*     transformation which simply drops the values for the unselected axes.
*     The inverse transformation (from new to old Frame) attempts to
*     assign usable values for the dropped axes if possible. This is only
*     possible if the value for a dropped axis can be determined uniquely
*     from the value of one of the selected axes. This may be the case
*     for instance in a situation where (RA,wavelength) axes were
*     selected from the (RA,Dec,Wavelength) axes describing a 2D longslit
*     spectrum. The missing Dec value can probably be determined from the
*     RA value because the relationship between RA and Dec is determined
*     by the position and orientation of the slit on the sky. If it is
*     not possible to determine the value for a dropped axis in this way,
*     then what happens depends on whether or not any Frames can be found
*     in the FrameSet that are Regions having a Domain name of "ROI<n>", 
*     where "<n>" is a positive integer. If no such Frame can be found, 
*     AST__BAD is supplied for the dropped axis.
*
*     If the supplied current Frame has too many axes, and one or more ROI 
*     Regions are found in the FrameSet, then a new Frame is added into
*     the FrameSet for each ROI Region found. These new Frames are all
*     equivalent, containing axes from the supplied current Frame as
*     specified by the USEAXIS parameter, and they are all connected to
*     the supplied current Frame via a PermMap. Each PermMap has a
*     forward transformation that simply drops the unwanted axis values.
*     The inverse transformation of each PermMap supplies suitable values 
*     for the unwanted axes. These are determined by transforming the
*     bounding box of the corresponding ROI Region into the original current 
*     Frame. The Domain name of the corresponding ROI Region is stored in
*     the Ident attribute of the new Frame, and is also appended to the
*     end of the Frame's Domain. The new Frame corresponding to the lowest 
*     numbered ROI Region is left as the current Frame on exit.

*  Parameters:
*     The name of the following environment parameter(s) are hard-wired 
*     into this subroutine in order to ensure conformity between application. 
*
*     USEAXIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A set of NDIM axes to be selected from the current Frame. Each 
*        axis can be specified either by giving its index within the current 
*        Frame in the range 1 to the number of axes in the Frame, or by
*        giving its symbol. This parameter is only accessed if the original 
*        current Frame in the supplied FrameSet has too many axes. The value 
*        should be given as a GRP group expression, with default control 
*        characters. 

*  Arguments:
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FrameSet to use. A new current Frame may be added to the
*        FrameSet by this routine.
*     DEFAX( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        This array should have one element for each axis in the base
*        Frame of the supplied FrameSet. The i'th value is the index 
*        within the original current Frame of the axis which is to be
*        associated with the i'th base Frame axis by default. Only used
*        if no better defaults can be found by splitting the FrameSet 
*        Mapping.
*     LBND( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel bound on each pixel axis. Array length should be
*        at least equal to the number of base Frame axes in IWCS.
*     UBND( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel bound on each pixel axis. Array length should be
*        at least equal to the number of base Frame axes in IWCS.
*     WORK( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Work space. It's length should be at least twice as large as the
*        largest pixel dimension implied by LBND and UBND.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
