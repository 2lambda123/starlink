      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ASREF( PNNDF, MODE, GOTNAM, NAME, NDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASREF

*  Purpose:
*     Associates an NDF optionally from a reference name or locator.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ASREF( PNNDF, MODE, GOTNAM, NAME, NDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine obtains an NDF.  There is a search path of sources
*     for the NDF checked in the following order: a) command line, b) a
*     reference locator or name, c) elsewhere in the parameter system
*     (usually by prompting.)  For a) and c) the NDF is obtained by
*     association.  For b) a locator or name is imported into the NDF_
*     system; an error will result if the locator does not point to a
*     valid NDF.  The role of this routine is to permit automatic
*     processing of NDFs associated with database pictures.  The
*     command-line access allows the NDF reference stored with the last
*     DATA picture to be overridden.

*  Arguments:
*     PNNDF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the Starlink parameter to be associated with the
*        input NDF. May be blank, in which case no attempt will be made
*        to obtain the NDF form the environment.
*     MODE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Access mode to the NDF required: 'READ' or 'UPDATE'.
*     GOTNAM = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., a name or locator to a potential NDF has already
*        been obtained and is supplied to this routine through the NAME
*        argument.  The name or locator may come from a reference in
*        the graphics database.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the potential NDF, or a locator to it.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The identifier to the NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The parameter should not have been associated before calling
*     this routine.

*  History:
*     1991 March 24 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1996 March 19 (MJC):
*        The reference string can also be an NDF specification as well
*        as a locator.  The GOTLOC and LOC arguments are renamed to
*        GOTNAM and NAME to reflect this.  Used the modern-style of
*        commenting.
*     2-JUL-1999 (DSB):
*        Modified so that an NDF is obtained by association if the
*        displayed NDF cannot be accessed.
*     13-JAN-2006 (DSB):
*        Modified so that the parameter name is ignored if blank.
