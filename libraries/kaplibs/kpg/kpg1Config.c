/*
*+
*  Name:
*     kpg1Config

*  Purpose:
*     Create an AST KeyMap holding a set of configuration parameter values.

*  Language:
*     C.

*  Invocation:
*     AstKeyMap *kpg1Config( const char *param, const char *def,
*                            AstKeyMap *nested, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function first creates a KeyMap by reading the values from a
*     specified text file (argument "def"). This text files specifies the
*     complete list of all allowed config parameters and their default
*     values. The KeyMap is then locked by setting its MapLocked attribute
*     to a true value. A GRP group is then obtained from the environment
*     using the specified parameter (argument "param"). The config
*     settings thus obtained are stored in the KeyMap. An error is reported
*     if the user-supplied group refers to any config parameters that were
*     not read earlier from the default file.
*
*     Both the defaults file and the user-supplied configuration may
*     contain several sets of "alternate" configuration parameter values,
*     and the set to use can be specified by the caller via the supplied
*     "nested" keymap. For instance, if a basic configuration contains
*     keys "par1" and "par2", the user could supply two alternate sets of
*     values for these keys by prepending each key name with the strings
*     "850" and "450" (say). Thus, the user could supply values for any
*     or all of: "par1", "par2", "450.par1", "450.par2", "850.par1",
*     "850.par2".
*
*     The "nested" keymap supplied by the caller serves two functions: 1)
*     it defines the known alternatives, and 2) it specifies which of the
*     aternatives is to be used. Each key in the supplied "nested" keymap
*     should be the name of an allowed alternative. In the above example,
*     a KeyMap containing keys "850" and "450" could be supplied. No
*     error is reported if the user-supplied configuration fails to
*     provide values for one or more of the alternatives. The value
*     associated with each key in the "nested" keymap should be an
*     integer - the alternative to be used should have a non-zero value,
*     and all other should be zero.
*
*     So first, the configuration parameters specified by the supplied
*     defaults file are examined. Any parameter that starts with the name
*     of the selected alternative (i.e. the key within "nested" that has
*     an associated value of 1) has the name of the alternative removed.
*     Any parameter that start with the name of any of the other
*     alternatives is simply removed from the configuration. Thus, using
*     the above example, if "nested" contains two entries - one with key
*     "850" and value "1", and the other with key "450" and value "0" -
*     the "850.par1" and "850.par2" entries in the defaults file would be
*     renamed as "par1" and "par2" (over-writing the original values for
*     "par1" and "par2"), and the "450.par1" and "450.par2" entries would
*     be deleted.
*
*     Next, the same process is applied to the user-supplied
*     configuration obtained via the specified environment parameter.
*
*     Finally, the values in the user-supplied configuration are used to
*     replace those in the defaults file.
*
*     The beneifts of using this function are that 1) the user gets to
*     know if they mis-spell a config parameter name, and 2) the default
*     parameter values can be defined in a single place, rather than
*     hard-wiring them into application code at each place where the
*     config parameter is used.

*  Arguments:
*     paramc = const char * (Given)
*        The name of the environment parameter to use.
*     def = const char * (Given)
*        The path to a file containing the default value for every allowaed config
*        parameter. For instance, "$SMURF_DIR/dimmconfig.def".
*     nested = AstKeyMap * (Given)
*        If non-NULL, used to determine which nested keys might be in the config
*        and which should be merged with the base keymap. The values in the keymap
*        should be non-zero to indicate merging.
*     status = int * (Given & Returned)
*        The inherited status.

*  Notes:
*     - The KeyError attribute is set non-zero in the returned KeyMap so that an error
*     will be reported by astMapGet<X> if the requested key does not exist in the KeyMap.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the AST KeyMap, or NULL if an error occurrs.
