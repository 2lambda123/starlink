      SUBROUTINE KPG1_GNLBU( NDF, PNLAB, COMP, AXSLAB, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_GNLBU

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains an axis annotation for NDF data or variance.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_GNLBU( NDF, PNLAB, COMP, AXSLAB, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine obtains an axis annotation from the parameter system.
*     The suggested default has the form "label (units)" when the NDF
*     has both a label and units, or "label" if there is a label but 
*     not units.  When neither component is present the default is the
*     component name follwed by " values".  The units are squared for
*     the variance component.  If a bad status, other than abort, is
*     returned by the parameter system when getting the value, the
*     error is annulled and the output annotation is the suggested
*     default value.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     PNLAB = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter from which the annotation will
*        be obtained.
*     COMP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Name of the NDF array component: 'DATA', 'QUALITY', 'VARIANCE',
*        or 'ERROR', though it is used literally and not checked to
*        be a member of this set.
*     AXSLAB = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The annotation obtained from the parameter system.  The dynamic
*        default is limited to 128 characters.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Find the label and units of the NDF so that they can form
*  the default axis label, otherwise take the component name appended
*  with " values"

*  Set the suggested default for the parameter.

*  Obtain the annotation from the parameter.
