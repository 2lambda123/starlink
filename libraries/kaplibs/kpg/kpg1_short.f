      LOGICAL FUNCTION KPG1_SHORT( TEMPLT, TEST, MARK, CASE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_SHORT

*  Purpose:
*     Check whether a string matches a supplied abbreviation template.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = KPG1_SHORT( TEMPLT, TEST, MARK, CASE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns .TRUE. if the supplied test string matches
*     the supplied abbreviation template. All characters in the template
*     must be matched by the corresponding characters in the test string,
*     with the exception that it is permissable for the test string to end
*     anywhere following the first occurrence of the mark string (the
*     mark string itself should not be matched in the test string). The
*     template sub-string in front of the first mark string thus gives
*     the minimum abbreviation which the test string can use.
*
*     For instance, if MARK='*' and TEMPLT='VECT*ORS', then the test string
*     matches if the first 4 characters are 'VECT' and any remaining
*     characters match 'ORS'.

*  Arguments:
*     TEMPLT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The abbreviation template. Trailing blanks are ignored.
*     TEST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The test string. Trailing blanks are ignored.
*     MARK = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The string which marks the end of the minimum abbreviation in
*        TEMPLT. Trailing blanks are ignored.
*     CASE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Should the match be case sensitive?
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Function Value:
*     KPG1_SHORT = LOGICAL
*        Returned .TRUE. if and only if the supplied test string matches the
*        template.
