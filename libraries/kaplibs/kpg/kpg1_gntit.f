      SUBROUTINE KPG1_GNTIT( NDF, PNTITL, DEFAUL, TITLE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_GNTIT

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a title using the NDF title as the suggested default.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_GNTIT( NDF, PNTITL, DEFAUL, TITLE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine obtains a title from the parameter system.  The
*     suggested default is title of the input NDF if it has one,
*     otherwise a supplied default is used.  If a bad status, other
*     than abort, is returned by the parameter system when getting the
*     value, the error is annulled and the output title is the default
*     value.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     PNTITL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter from which the title will be
*        obtained.
*     DEFAUL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The suggested default when the NDF does not have a title, or
*        the actual value returned when a null (!) value or any other
*        non-abort bad status is obtained from the parameter system.
*     TITLE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The title obtained from the parameter system.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
