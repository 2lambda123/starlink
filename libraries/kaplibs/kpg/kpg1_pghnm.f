      SUBROUTINE KPG1_PGHNM( NAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_PGHNM

*  Purpose:
*     Return an HDS name describing the current PGPLOT graphics device.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PGHNM( NAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns a string which can be used as an HDS component
*     name. The string describes the current PGPLOT graphics device. It is
*     intended for use in identifying resources related to the graphics
*     device (such as palette and colour table), stored within HDS files.
*
*     For most devices, the returned name is simply the PGPLOT device type.
*     For GWM windows, the returned string includes the name of the gwm
*     window (so that each window can have separate resources).

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZNAM ) (Returned)
*        The returned string.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A graphics device must previously have been opened using PGPLOT.
