*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASDIS

*  Purpose:
*     Find the distance between two points.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = KPG1_ASDIS( FRAME, DIM, NAX, POS, I1, I2, GEO, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the distance between two positions in the 
*     supplied co-ordinate Frame. Either the geodesic or Euclidean distance 
*     can be returned.

*  Arguments:
*     FRAME = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to the Frame. Only accessed if GEO is .TRUE.
*     DIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the first dimension of the POS array.
*     NAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of axes in the Frame.
*     POS( DIM, NAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        An array holding the co-ordinates at DIM positions within the
*        supplied Frame.
*     I1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the first position, in the range 1 to DIM.
*     I2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the second position, in the range 1 to DIM.
*     GEO = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Is the geodesic distance required?
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Returned Value:
*     KPG1_ASDIS = DOUBLE PRECISION
*        The distance between the two points.
