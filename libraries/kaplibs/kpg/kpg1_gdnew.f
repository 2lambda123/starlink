*  Name:
*     KPG1_GDNEW

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new DATA picture with ancillary pictures.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_GDNEW( COMMNT, MARGIN, NP, PNAME, PSIDE, PSIZE, 
*                      SASPEC, BOX, IPICD, IPICF, IPIC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns identifiers for a new DATA picture together
*     with various ancillary pictures in the graphics database. On exit, 
*     the new DATA picture is the current AGI picture, and the PGPLOT 
*     viewport matches the DATA picture.
*
*     A FRAME picture is only created if it would contain something other
*     than the DATA picture (this is assumed to be the case if any
*     ancillary pictures are requested, or if non-zero margins are requested
*     around the DATA picture). If created, the FRAME picture has the 
*     maximum possible size. The DATA picture is then created with a size 
*     which allows all the requested ancillary pictures to be created within 
*     the FRAME picture.
*
*     Various environment parameters are used to obtain options, etc. The
*     names of these parameters are hard-wired into this subroutine in
*     order to ensure conformity between application. 

*  Environment Parameters:
*     FILL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the supplied aspect ratio (SASPEC) is to be ignored, 
*        creating the largest possible DATA picture within the current 
*        picture.  When FILL is FALSE, the DATA picture is created with 
*        the supplied aspect ratio. Not accessed if argument SASPEC is
*        supplied equal to zero (i.e. (SASPEC .EQ. 0.0) implies FILL=YES)

*  Arguments:
*     COMMENT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A comment to store with the new pictures added to the AGI
*        database. This will usually by an indication of the application
*        being run (eg KAPPA_DISPLAY).
*     MARGIN( 4 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The width of the borders to leave round the DATA picture, given
*        as fractions of the corresponding dimension of the current picture.
*        These should be supplied in the order bottom, right, top, left.
*     NP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of extra pictures to be included in the FRAME pictures
*        (the DATA picture itself is not included in this list). Margins are 
*        left round the DATA picture with widths given by MARGIN. Any extra 
*        pictures are placed outside these margins, in positions described by 
*        PSIDE and PSIZE. 
*     PNAME( NP ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The names to store in the AGI database with the NP extra pictures.
*     PSIDE( NP ) = CHARACTER * 1 (Given)
*        Each element of this array should be one of L, R, T or B. It
*        indicates which side of the FRAME picture an extra picture is to be
*        placed. For Left and Right, the extra picture occupies the full
*        height of the DATA picture, margins, and any previously created 
*        extra pictures. The picture is placed at the far Left or Right of 
*        all previously created pictures. For Top or Bottom, the extra picture 
*        occupies the full width of the DATA picture, margins, and any 
*        previously created extra pictures. The picture is placed at the top or
*        bottom of all previously created pictures. Ignored if NP is zero.
*     PSIZE( NP ) = REAL (Given)
*        The size of each extra picture. For Left and Right pictures, this 
*        is the width of the picture, and the value is given as a fraction
*        of the width of the current picture. For Top and Bottom pictures, 
*        it is the height of the picture, and it is given as a fraction of 
*        the height of the current picture. Ignored if NP is zero.
*     SASPEC = REAL (Given)
*        The aspect ratio with which a new DATA picture should be created.
*        This is the height divided by the width of the DATA picture,
*        assuming equal scales on each axis (eg metres). A value of zero
*        causes the DATA picture to have the aspect ratio which produces
*        the largest picture. The actual value used will depend on the
*        value supplied for the FILL parameter (see above).
*     BOX( 4 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The world coordinate bounds to give to the DATA picture if a new 
*        DATA picture is created. These should normally be pixel
*        coordinates. The (x,y) coordinates of the bottom left corner should 
*        be given in elements 1 and 2, and the (x,y) coordinates of the top 
*        right corner should be given in elements 3 and 4. If the box has 
*        zero area, then world coordinates are set to centimetres from the 
*        bottom left corner of the DATA picture.
*     IPICD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AGI identifier for the DATA picture.
*     IPICF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AGI identifier for the FRAME picture. The world co-ordinate
*        system is inherited from the current picture on entry. If no 
*        FRAME picture was created, then an AGI identifier for the current 
*        picture is returned.
*     IPIC( NP ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An array of AGI identifiers corresponding to the extra pictures
*        requested in ZSIDE and PSIZE. The world coordinate system for each
*        picture is inherited from the FRAME picture. The actual size of a 
*        picture may be less than the requested size if there is insufficient 
*        room left in the FRAME picture to give it its requested size.
*        Identifiers for pictures which would have zero size (i.e. fall 
*        completely outside the FRAME picture) are returned equal to -1, 
*        but no error is reported.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Picture identifiers are returned equal to -1 if an error occurs,
*     or if the picture cannot be created.
