      SUBROUTINE KPG1_GDWIN( IPIC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_GDWIN

*  Purpose:
*     Set PGPLOT world co-ordinates to be the world co-ordinates
*     of the specified AGI picture.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL  KPG1_GDWIN( IPIC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine finds the bounds of the current PGPLOT viewport within
*     the world-coordinate system of a specified AGI picture, and sets the
*     PGPLOT window accordingly.

*  Arguments:
*     IPIC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The AGI picture identifier. If -1, then the current picture is
*        used.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
