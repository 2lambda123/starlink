      SUBROUTINE KPG1_PSFS<T>( PSF, NPIX, NLIN, WORK, NPW, NLW, FRACT,

*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_PSFSx

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the approximate size of a 2-dimensional PSF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PSFSx( PSF, NPIX, NLIN, WORK, NPW, NLW, FRACT, ILEVEL,
*                      XSIZE, YSIZE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Marginal profiles are formed of the absolute PSF values along
*     both axes.  For each axis the maximum and minimum values in the
*     corresponding profile are found.  The first and last point at
*     which each profile reaches a specified fraction of its total
*     range is found, and the difference returned as the corresponding
*     PSF size.  N.B., it is assumed that the input PSF contains no bad
*     pixels.

*  Arguments:
*     PSF( NPIX, NLIN ) = ? (Given)
*        The PSF image.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels per line in the PSF image.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lines in the PSF image.
*     WORK( NPW, NLW ) = ? (Given)
*        Work space.
*     NPW = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of elements per line in the work array.  This should be
*        at least equal to the maximum of NPIX and NLIN.
*     NLW = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lines in the work array.  This should be at least 2.
*     ILEVEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The user information level.  If ILEVEL is 2 or more, then the
*        user is told what the calculated sizes are.
*     FRACT = REAL (Given)
*        The fraction of the PSF peak amplitude at which the PSF size
*        is determined.  It should be positive and less than 0.5.  If
*        it is outside this range one sixteenth is used.
*     XSIZE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The width in x of the PSF, in units of pixels.
*     YSIZE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The width in y of the PSF, in units of lines.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for processing single- and double-precision
*     arrays; replace "x" in the routine name by R or D as appropriate.
*     The data type of the PSF and WORK arguments must match the
*     routine used.

*  History:
*     27-SEP-1990 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     4-MAR-1991 (DSB):
*        Name changed form PSFSIZ to KPS1_PSFS2
*     1991 July 18 (MJC):
*        Named changed from KPS1_PSFS2 to KPG1_PSFS2.  FRACT argument
*        added.
*     10-JAN-1995 (DSB):
*        Name changed from KPG1_PSFS2 to KPG1_PSFSR.  Re-formatted to 
*        edstar-style. Expression for TARGET changed from:
*              TARGET = ( <X/Y>MAX - <X/Y>MIN ) * CFRACT
*        to:
*              TARGET = ( <X/Y>MAX - <X/Y>MIN ) * CFRACT + <X/Y>MIN
*
*        Also changed to use the absolute PSF values instead of the
*        supplied PSF values.
*     1995 March 22 (MJC):
*        Made generic, corrected typo's, removed long lines, various
*        other stylistic changes and used modern-style variable
*        declarations.
