*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_STORx( EL, INDEX, VALUE, DATA, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied value is stored in the array at the given index.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in the array.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index at which to store the supplied value.
*     VALUE = ? (Given)
*        The value to be stored in the array.
*     DATA( EL ) = ? (Given and Returned)
*        The array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
