      SUBROUTINE KPG1_MEDU<T>( BAD, EL, ARRAY, MEDIAN, NELUSE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_MEDU<T>
 
*  Purpose:
*     Derives the unweighted median of a vector.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_MEDU<T>( BAD, EL, ARRAY, MEDIAN, NELUSE, STATUS )
 
*  Description:
*     This routine derives the unweighted median of an array.  If there
*     are an even number of elements, the median is computed from the
*     mean of the two elements that straddle the median.
 
*  Arguments:
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If BAD is .TRUE. there may be bad pixels present in the vector
*        and so should be tested.  If BAD is .FALSE. there is no testing
*        for bad values.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements within the array to sort.
*     ARRAY( EL ) = <TYPE> (Given and Returned)
*        The array whose median is to be found.  On exit the array is
*        partially sorted.
*     MEDIAN = <TYPE> (Returned)
*        The median of the array.
*     NELUSE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of elements actually used after bad values have been
*        excluded.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
 
*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric data type.
 
*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     The routine could be made more efficient by using a partial
*     Quicksort, stopping once the median is found.  The current version
*     is an interim solution.
