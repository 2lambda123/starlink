      SUBROUTINE KPG1_CROUT( PARNAM, TLENAM, NDIM, DIMS, ORIGIN, LOCAT,
     :                       DATLOC, DNAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_CROUT

*  Purpose:
*     Creates and returns locators to the top-level and data-array of
*     an NDF-type structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_CROUT( PARNAM, TLENAM, NDIM, DIMS, ORIGIN, LOCAT,
*                      DATLOC, DNAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An NDF-type data structure, associated with the supplied
*     parameter name is created.  A locator for this structure is
*     returned.  A TITLE component, associated with another parameter
*     name is created within the structure and a character value, is
*     obtained from the parameter system and written to the TITLE
*     component.  A DATA_ARRAY component is created.  If the supplied
*     origins are all one, DATA_ARRAY is primitive, having the supplied
*     dimensionality and dimensions, and is of type _REAL.  Otherwise
*     DATA_ARRAY is a simple ARRAY-type structure containing the
*     primitive _REAL data array and origin information.  The locator to
*     the primitive data array is also returned.

*  Arguments:
*     PARNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter name associated with the NDF-type structure to
*        be created.
*     TLENAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter name associated with the TITLE component created
*        in the new NDF-type structure.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimensionality of the data-array component of the new
*        NDF-type structure.
*     DIMS( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimensions of the data-array component of the new NDF-type
*        structure.
*     ORIGIN( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The origin information of the data array.  If a primitive
*        NDF is to be created these should all be set to 1.  Note though
*        if other ARRAY-type components---QUALITY and VARIANCE---are
*        propagated, the origin data of ARRAY-type components must be
*        consistent not to invalidate the NDF.  Therefore use the values
*        returned by KPG1_GETIM unless QUALITY and VARIANCE are not
*        propagated.
*     LOCAT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        Locator to the new NDF-type structure.  If status is bad on
*        exit this locator is annulled.  If status is bad on exit this
*        locator is annulled.
*     DATLOC  = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Returned)
*        The locator to the structure containing the primitive
*        form of the data array.  If it is the top-level of the NDF
*        structure, it will be a clone of LOCAT.  Either way it will
*        require annulment.  If status is bad on exit this locator is
*        annulled.
*     DNAME = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZNAM ) (Returned)
*        The name of the data array as this will be needed for access,
*        and it is different depending on its location.  This argument
*        is probably unnecessary, but it is here defensively, in case
*        the origin is changed to or from the default.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This a stop-gap routine until the remainder of KAPPA
*     IMAGE-format applications are converted to NDF.  It enables both
*     primitive (i.e. IMAGE-format) and simple NDFs to be processed.
*     -  The maximum length of the TITLE component produced by this
*     routine is 72 characters.

*  aLGOrithm:
*     -  Create a new NDF-type data structure associated with the
*     parameter name PARNAM.  Get a locator to this NDF-type structure.
*     -  If no errors so far then get a character string associated
*     with parameter name TLENAM and write it to the TITLE component.
*     A null title value prevents creation of the TITLE component.
*     -  Determine whether the DATA_ARRAY component WILL BE primitive or
*     a structure.
*        o  For the former all the origins must be 1.  Create a
*        DATA_ARRAY component of dimensions DIMS( NDIM ).  Assign the
*        returned name to 'DATA_ARRAY'.
*        o  For the latter, create an ARRAY structure and create the
*        DATA component of dimensions DIMS( NDIM ).  Create and write
*        the origin data to this structure.  Create an ORIGIN component
*        and write the origin data to it.  Clone the DATA_ARRAY
*        structure's locator for return.  Assign the returned name to
*        'DATA'.
*     -  If error has occurred Annul the returned locators.
