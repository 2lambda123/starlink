      SUBROUTINE KPG1_WCFAX( LBND, UBND, MAP, JAXIS, IAXIS, CENTRE,
     :                       WORK, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_WCFAX

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains the co-ordinate of an axis in the current WCS Frame at
*     every pixel centre in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_WCFAX( LBND, UBND, MAP, JAXIS, IAXIS, CENTRE, WORK,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the world co-ordinate along a nominated WCS
*     axis for each pixel centre of an NDF.  The co-ordinates are defined
*     within the current Frame in the supplied FrameSet. It is assumed
*     that the nominated axis is independent of the other axes.

*  Arguments:
*     LBND( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of the NDF. This array should have
*        one element for each NDF pixel axis.
*     UBND( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of the NDF. This array should have
*        one element for each NDF pixel axis.
*     MAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Mapping from PIXEL coords in the NDF to current WCS coords.
*     JAXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the pixel axis which is varied.
*     IAXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the WCS axis whose values are returned.
*     CENTRE( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The current-Frame co-ordinate along the nominated axis at each
*        pixel centre. The size and shape of this array should be the
*        same as the NDF.
*     WORK( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        A work array with the same length as the requested pixel axis.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     2006 January 25 (MJC):
*        Original version based upon DSB's FTS1_WCSAX.
*     2006 February 2 (MJC):
*        Some tidying after switch from AXIS Frame to current Frame for
*        output co-ordinates.
*     2006 February 10 (MJC):
*        Further tidying.  Checked for a 1-1 mapping to avoid n-D to
*        1-D transformation, preferring to obain just one vector and
*        duplicating it.
*     2006 February 15 (MJC):
*        Set expansion factors to 1 for unused duimensions up to
*        NDF__MXDIM.
*     10-MAY-2007 (DSB):
*        Re-written to use a specified range of GRID coords, and to be
*        simpler.
