      SUBROUTINE KPG1_AXBN<T>( EL, CENTRE, AXLCO, AXUCO, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_AXBNx

*  Purpose:
*     Find the bounds of an NDF's axis centre co-ordinates.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_AXBNx( EL, CENTRE, AXLCO, AXUCO, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines the lowest and highest centre
*     co-ordinate for an NDF axis array component.  Currently, it
*     assumes that these will be the first and last elements.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in the axis.
*     CENTRE( EL ) = ? (Given)
*        The NDF axis centre co-ordinates.
*     AXLCO = ? (Returned)
*        The lowest centre co-ordinates for the axis.
*     AXUCO = ? (Returned)
*        The highest centre co-ordinate for the axis.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for the data types real or double precision:
*     replace "x" in the routine name by R or D respectively, as
*     appropriate.  The centre array and the returned values
*     should have this data type as well.
