*  Name:
*     KPG1_PL2GE

*  Purpose:
*     Reads 2-dimensional polynomial information from a POLYNOMIAL
*     structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PL2GE( LOC, MXPAR, VARNT, NXPAR, NYPAR, LIMITS, XMIN,
*                      XMAX, YMIN, YMAX, COEFF, VARPRE, VARIAN, WORK,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine reads information describing a 2-dimensional
*     polynomial surface from a standard Starlink POLYNOMIAL structure,
*     as defined in SGP/38.  All floating-point information within the
*     structure is returned as DOUBLE PRECISION.
*
*     It is assumed the calling program needs a 1-dimensional array of
*     coefficients, where COEFF( (IX-1)*NYPAR + IY ) contains the
*     coefficient for the (IX,IY)th term (with NYPAR being the total
*     number of Y terms).  Such a 1-dimensional array is used by the
*     NAG routines and defined in the NAG manual (see Chapter E02 on
*     "Curve and Surface fitting").
*
*     This routine will convert read the 2-dimensional coefficient
*     array from the POLYNOMIAL structure (in the format described in
*     SGP/38) and load a flipped version of this into the required
*     1-dimensional array.  If there is a variance array present, the
*     VARPRE flag is set .TRUE., and the variances returned in VARIAN.
*
*     The routine will also read the TMIN and TMAX arrays from the
*     structure and return XMIN, XMAX, YMIN and YMAX.  Note that these
*     items are compulsory when VARNT='CHEBYSHEV' but optional when
*     VARNT='SIMPLE'.  In the latter case an attempt will be made to
*     read TMIN and TMAX from the structure, but their absence will not
*     be regarded as an error.  The returned parameter LIMITS will
*     indicate if these items have been read successfully.
*
*     

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER*( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given)
*        Locator to the existing POLYNOMIAL structure.
*     MXPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of parameters in either x or y.  The
*        declared size of the coefficient arrays given to this routine
*        is assumed to be MXPAR * MXPAR (see below).
*     VARNT = CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        Variant of the polynomial ('CHEBYSHEV' or 'SIMPLE').  This
*        item should be at least CHARACTER*9.
*     NXPAR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of x parameters (= order of polynomial in x direction +
*        1)
*     NYPAR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of y parameters (= order of polynomial in Y direction + 1)
*     LIMITS = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        When VARNT='SIMPLE' this logical flag indicates whether any
*        TMIN and TMAX limits have been read from the polynomial
*        structure and returned in the next 4 arguments (in which case
*        LIMITS will be .TRUE.).
*     XMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Minimum value along x axis for which polynomial is valid.
*     XMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Maximum value along x axis for which polynomial is valid.
*     YMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Minimum value along y axis for which polynomial is valid.
*     YMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Maximum value along y axis for which polynomial is valid.
*     COEFF( MXPAR * MXPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Array of polynomial coefficients, in the format used by NAG
*        routines (see KPS1_FSPF2).
*     VARPRE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether or not there are coefficient variances present in the
*        POLYNOMIAL structure.
*     VARIAN( MXPAR * MXPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Array of polynomial coefficient variances, in the format used
*        by NAG routines.  The values are only assigned when VARPRE is
*        .TRUE..
*     WORK( MXPAR, MXPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Work array containing the 2-dimensional array of coefficients as read from the
*        POLYNOMIAL structure.
*     STATUS =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.

*  Notes:
*     -  Uses the magic-value method for bad or undefined pixels.

*  History:
*     22-Apr-1993 (SMB):
*        Original version.
*     23-Apr-1993 (SMB):
*        DAT_PAR included (commented out) so the routine can work
*        in a UNIX environment.
*     6-May-1993 (SMB):
*        DAT_PAR does not need to be commented out.
*     10-May-1993 (SMB):
*        I had mis-understood the meaning of the arguments of
*        CMP_GETND.  Now corrected.
*     1995 July 30 (MJC):
*        Renamed from PLYPUT2D.  Used modern prologue and style.
*     1997 May 10 (MJC):
*        Added VARIAN and VARPRE arguments.
