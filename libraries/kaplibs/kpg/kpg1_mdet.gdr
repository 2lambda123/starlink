      SUBROUTINE KPG1_MDET<T>( N, EL, ARRAY, WORK1, WORK2, DET, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_MDETx
 
*  Purpose:
*     Computes the determinant of a matrix.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_MDETX( N, EL, ARRAY, WORK1, WORK2, DET, STATUS )
 
*  Description:
*     This routine calculates the determinant of an arbitrary n-by-n
*     matrix.  It LU decomposes the matrix and then forms the product
*     of the diagonals by summing their logarithms to base 10.
*     Logarithmic calculations are used to prevent overflows. A bad
*     status is returned when the matrix is singular or the determinant
*     is too large to store in a <COMM>-number representation.
 
*  Arguments:
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of rows and columns in the matrix whose determinant
*        is to be derived.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the first dimension of the array as declared in the
*        calling routine.  This should be at least equal to N.
*     ARRAY( EL, N ) = ? (Given and Returned)
*        On input this is the matrix whose determinant is to be found.
*        Since the LU decomposition is performed in situ, the input
*        values are lost.  (On exit it is the LU decomposed form of the
*        rowwise-permuted input ARRAY, with the diagonals being part of
*        the upper triangular matrix.)
*     WORK1( N ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Workspace for the LU decomposition.
*     WORK2( N ) = ? (Returned)
*        Workspace for the LU decomposition.
*     DET = ? (Returned)
*        The determinant of matrix ARRAY.  It is set to 1.0 when the
*        matrix is singular.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
 
*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for the data types real or double precision:
*     replace "x" in the routine name by R or D respectively, as
*     appropriate.  The matrix and the SECOND workspace should have
*     this data type as well.
