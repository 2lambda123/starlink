*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_RETRx

*  Purpose:
*     Retrieves a value from an array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_RETRx( EL, INDEX, DATA, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The value stored at a given index within the supplied array is
*     returned.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in the array.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the array of the required value.
*     DATA( EL ) = ? (Given)
*        The input array.
*     VALUE = ? (Returned)
*        The returned value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for all numeric data types: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by B, D, I, R, UB, UW, or W as appropriate.  The
