*  Name:
*     KPG_ASTCMN

*  Purpose:
*     Define functional accessor/setter interface to KPG_AST common block

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutines

*  Description:
*     This file contains a set of functions that enable access to the
*     KPG_AST common block from outside of the KPG library. Routines
*     are only added on demand.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_SETASTxxx    or   VALUE = KPG1_GETASTxxx

*  Implementation Details:
*     The following routines are available:
*       KPG1_SETASTLN( LN ) - Set the ASTLN integer
*       KPG1_SETASTGRP( GRP ) - Set the ASTGRP identifier
*       KPG1_SETASTGSP( CHAR ) - Set ASTGSP character
*       KPG1_SETASTDSB( DRDSB ) - Set DRWDSB flag
*       KPG1_SETASTFIT( FIT ) - Set FIT flag
*       KPG1_SETASTPLN( PLN ) - KeyMap used to store details of lines drawn
*       KPG1_SETASTBLE( BLE ) - Are plot edges to be kept free of ticks etc?
*       KPG1_SETASTX1( X1 ) - Left hand X value in Plot.
*       KPG1_SETASTX2( X2 ) - Right hand X value in Plot.
*       KPG1_SETASTY1( Y1 ) - Bottom Y value in Plot.
*       KPG1_SETASTY2( Y2 ) - Top Y value in Plot.
*       KPG1_GETASTNPS()
*       KPG1_GETASTING()
*       KPG1_GETASTOUG()
*       KPG1_GETASTDSB() 
*       KPG1_GETASTFIT() 
*       KPG1_GETASTPLN() 
*       KPG1_GETASTBLE() 
*       KPG1_GETASTX1() 
*       KPG1_GETASTX2() 
*       KPG1_GETASTY1() 
*       KPG1_GETASTY2() 

*  Notes:
*     Since the routines are only 3 lines long, they are all in 
*     a single file with minimal comment wrapper. Types of the argument
*     for SET methods match the type in the common block.
