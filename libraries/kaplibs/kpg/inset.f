      LOGICAL FUNCTION INSET( SET, STRING )
*+
*  Name:
*     INSET

*  Purpose:
*     will be .TRUE. if STRING is a member of the "set" SET.

*  Language:
*     Starlink

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = INSET( SET, STRING )

*  Description:
*     Checks a character variable, STRING, for being equal to any of a
*     number of possible values given in the pseudo set, SET, which is
*     also a character variable. The possible values can be any length
*     and can differ in length throughout the set. They should be
*     separated by a comma. Upper and lower case are treated as being
*     equivalent.

*  Arguments:
*     SET = CHAR*(*)( READ )
*        The pseudo set of possible values for string. This "set"
*        takes the following form : 'string1,string2,.......,stringN'
*        where each of the substrings string1 up to stringN can be of
*        different lengths.
*     STRING = CHAR*(*)( READ )
*        The string to be checked for membership of the pseudo set.

*  Returned Value:
*     INSET = LOGICAL
*        .TRUE. if STRING is a member of the "set" SET, otherwise
*        .FALSE. .

*  Algorithm:
*     Set the default return value to .FALSE.
*     Find out the stripped lengths of STRING and SET.
*     Initialise the current string start position
*     Initialise the END logical to .FALSE.
*     Do until end-of-set or INSET = .TRUE.
*        Find position of next comma relative to current string start
*          position
*        If no more commas
*           Set comma position to be end of set
*           Set END to .TRUE.
*        Endif
*        INSET = .TRUE. if sub-string of SET between CURR and COMMA-1
*        matches the input test string STRING
*        Work out next CURR position from COMMA+1
*     Enddo
*     Return

*    set up default return value

      INSET = .FALSE.

*    get the length of the "set", stripping trailing blanks

      SETLEN = CHR_LEN( SET )

*    get the length of the string, stripping trailing blanks

      STRLEN = CHR_LEN( STRING )

*    initialise the current position pointer - points to the
*    first character of the next string

      CURR = 1

*    set up 'end-of-set' marker

      END = .FALSE.

*    start search loop - continue until end of set is reached, or
*    string is matched

      DO WHILE( ( .NOT. END ) .AND. ( .NOT. INSET ) )

*       find the position of the next comma relative to the position
*       of CURR, i.e. how many characters away it is from CURR

         COMMA = CHR_INDEX( SET( CURR:SETLEN ), ',' )

*       if this value is zero, then there are no more commas in the
*       set, so set COMMA to be the number of characters left from
*       the current position of CURR to the end of the SET plus 2,
*       Also, set END to be .TRUE.

         IF( COMMA .EQ. 0 ) THEN
            COMMA = SETLEN - CURR + 2
            END = .TRUE.
         END IF

*       now test to see whether the string between CURR and COMMA-1
*       matches up to the value of STRING - if so, INSET = .TRUE.

         INSET = CHR_SIMLR( SET(CURR:CURR+COMMA-2), STRING(1:STRLEN) )

*       update the position of CURR for next pass through loop

         CURR = CURR + COMMA

      END DO

*    that's it - return

      END
