      SUBROUTINE KPG1_VEC2N( NVEC, VEC, NDIM, LBND, UBND, IDIM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_VEC2N

*  Purpose:
*     Converts vectorised array indices into n-dimensional form.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_VEC2N( NVEC, VEC, NDIM, LBND, UBND, IDIM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine converts pixel indices which refer to a pixel in a
*     vectorised array into sets of indices which identify the same
*     pixel when the array is regarded as n-dimensional, with specified
*     lower and upper pixel-index bounds for each dimension.

*  Arguments:
*     NVEC = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of vectorised array indices to convert.
*     VEC( NVEC ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Array of vectorised pixel indices to be converted.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of array dimensions.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Lower pixel-index bounds for each array dimension.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Upper pixel-index bounds for each array dimension.
*     IDIM( NDIM, NVEC ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Returns a set of NDIM pixel-indices for each vectorised index
*        supplied.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The maximum number of dimensions which can be handled by this
*     routine is equal to the symbolic constant NDF__MXDIM.
