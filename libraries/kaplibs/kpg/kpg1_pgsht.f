      SUBROUTINE KPG1_PGSHT( HGT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_PGSHT

*  Purpose:
*     Set the PGPLOT character size in world coordinates.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL  KPG1_PGSHT( HGT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine sets the PGPLOT character size to a specified value in
*     world coordinates. It mimics SGS_SHTX in so far as this is possible.
*
*     Note SGS and PGPLOT behave differently if the scales on the X and Y
*     axes are not equal. SGS keeps the character size constant in world
*     oordinates, so absolute character size will be different for vertical
*     and horizontal text. On the other hand, PGPLOT keeps the absolute
*     character size fixed, resulting in the characters size in world
*     coordinates varying for horizontal and vertical text. This routine
*     sets the size for horizontal text. If the axis scales are not equal, 
*     vertical text will have have a different size (in world coordinates).

*  Arguments:
*     HGT = REAL (Given)
*        The required character height, in world coordinates.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
