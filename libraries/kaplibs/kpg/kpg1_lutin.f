      SUBROUTINE KPG1_LUTIN( INEL, INARR, OUTEL, NN, OUTARR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_LUTIN

*  Purpose:
*     Transfers a lookup table between arrays that have different
*     numbers of colour indices.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_LUTIN( INEL, INARR, OUTEL, NN, OUTARR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine transfers a lookup table between arrays that may
*     have different numbers of colour indices.  When they are unequal
*     the lookup table is expanded or contracted to fit the destination
*     array.  This may be achieved either by linear interpolation or by
*     the nearest-neighbour method.  (There are different sizes
*     presumably because the lookup table was created on a device with
*     a differently sized colour table.)  If the arrays are of equal
*     size the lookup table is merely copied between them.

*  Arguments:
*     INEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of colour indices in the lookup table.
*     INARR( 3, 0:INEL-1 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The source lookup table.  The first dimension is RGB.  Values
*        should lie in the range 0.0--1.0.
*     OUTEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of colour indices available in the destination
*        array.  This is usually the number of colour indices available
*        on the chosen graphics device.
*     NN = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, and the number of input and output colour indices are
*        different, the nearest-neighbour method is used for assigning
*        values in the output array.  Otherwise linear interpolation
*        is used.  Nearest-neighbour preserves sharp edges in the
*        lookup; linear interpolation is recommended for smoothly
*        varying lookup tables.
*     OUTARR( 3, 0:OUTEL-1 ) = REAL (Returned)
*        This is the array into which the table is put. The values will
*        all lie in the range 0.0--1.0, even though the input may beyond
*        this range. (Input values below 0.0 become 0.0 in OUTARR, and
*        those above 1.0 become 1.0)
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  If the data can be copied, i.e. the number of colour indices
*     are the same then transfer lookup table data from the input array
*     to the lookup-table array, checking the bounds lie between 0 and
*     1.
*     -  For unequal arrays a scale factor is computed and loops for
*     all output-array colour indices finding the equivalent input
*     values either by linear interpolation or nearest neighbour.  The
*     output values are constrained to the range 0.0--1.0.
