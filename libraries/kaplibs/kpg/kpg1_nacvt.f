      SUBROUTINE KPG1_NACVT( LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_NACVT

*  Purpose:
*     Convert an HDS object hierarchy to native data representation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_NACVT( LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine recursively descends an HDS object hierarchy,
*     converting any primitive objects within it to have the
*     appropriate native data representation, as provided by the host
*     machine. This will minimise subsequent access time for this
*     machine.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given and Returned)
*        Locator for the object or structure whose contents are to be
*        converted. If the object is primitive, then this locator may
*        be replaced by a new one on output (as the object may need to
*        be erased and re-created).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     The routine implements a recursive algorithm to descend the HDS
*     structure, recursion being implemented by saving current values
*     on a stack and returning to the start of the routine. A
*     subsequent return from the recursively-invoked algorithm then
*     involves returning to the centre of the routine (following the
*     point of invocation) and popping the stack. This requires
*     branching back into the range of several loops, so all looping is
*     in this routine is implemented using GO TO statements rather than
*     DO loops.
