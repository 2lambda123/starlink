      SUBROUTINE KPG1_PQVID( PNDEV, CLASS, CRITER, MININT, UP,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_PQVID

*  Purpose:
*     Tests whether the current graphics device has suitable
*     image-display characteristics.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PQVID( PNDEV, CLASS, CRITER, MININT, UP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines whether the current graphics device is an
*     image display with suitable characteristics.  The checks are
*     performed in the following order: the class of the device is
*     checked against a supplied list of acceptable classes; the
*     presence of certain attributes, given in a supplied list are
*     checked in the order colour, input and open with reset; and
*     finally a minimum number of colour indices must be exceeded.

*  Arguments:
*     PNDEV = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The ADAM parameter associated with the current graphics
*        workstation.  It is used to generate error messages.
*     CLASS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A list of acceptable workstation classes as defined by GNS,
*        each separated by a comma.  See SUN/57 for a list. Note, as
*        GNS does not yet support PGPLOT, no checks are mode on GNS 
*        class when using PGPLOT. Class checks are ignored if a blank
*        string is supplied.
*     CRITER = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A list of criteria that the workstation must pass in order to
*        be an acceptable image display.  The options are: 'COLOUR' if
*        colour must be available, 'CURSOR' if a cursor must be
*        available on the workstation. Non-standard criteria will be
*        ignored.
*     MININT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Minimum number of intensities or colour indices required.  The
*        routine ensures that there are at least the specified number.
*     UP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The highest available colour index available. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  A PGPLOT workstation must be open.
