      SUBROUTINE KPG1_KGODR( VAR, NPTS, INARR, INVAR, NGOOD, OUTARR,
     :                         OUTVAR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_KGODx
 
*  Purpose:
*     Sort through a dataset and throw away bad values.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_KGODx( VAR, NPTS, INARR, INVAR, NGOOD, OUTARR, OUTVAR,
*                      STATUS )
 
*  Description:
*     This routine copies good data and its variance from input arrays
*     to to output arrays, leaving behind bad values.
 
*  Arguments:
*     VAR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., copy the variance array as well, else only copy
*        the data array.
*     NPTS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of points in the input array.
*     INARR( NPTS ) = ? (Given)
*        Input data array.
*     INVAR( NPTS ) = ? (Given)
*        Input variance array.
*     NGOOD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of good points in the input data.
*     INARR( NPTS ) = ? (Returned)
*        Output data array.
*     INVAR( NPTS ) = ? (Returned)
*        Output variance array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*        Global status value.
 
*  Notes:
*     -  Data are still good even if variance is bad.  Put another way,
*     when the data is good, its corresponding variance is copied
*     regardless of its value.
*     -  There is a routine for all numeric data types: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by B, D, I, R, UB, UW, or W as appropriate.  The
*     arrays supplied to the routine must have the data type specified.
