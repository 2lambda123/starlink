      SUBROUTINE KPG1_RDAST( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_RDAST

*  Purpose:
*     Read AST_ data as text from an HDS object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_RDAST

*  Description:
*     This is a service routine to be provided as a "source" routine
*     for the AST_CHANNEL function. It reads data from an HDS object
*     (in response to reading from an AST_ Channel) and delivers it to
*     the AST_ library for interpretation.
*
*     This routine has only a STATUS argument, so it communicates with
*     other KPG routines via global variables stored in the KPG_AST common 
*     blocks. These are described below under "Global Variables used as 
*     Arguments".

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Global Variables used as Arguments:
*     ASTLC = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given)
*        A locator for the HDS object which holds the data. This must
*        be a 1-dimensional _CHAR array, whose size and character
*        string length will be determined via this locator.
*     ASTLN = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        This must initially be set to the value 1, to indicate that
*        data will be read starting at the first element of the HDS
*        array (note the routine will not operate correctly unless 1 is
*        the initial value - you cannot start reading at another point
*        in the array if you have previously read from a different
*        array). On exit it will be incremented by the number of
*        elements used to obtain data, so that it identifies the first
*        element to be used on the next invocation.
*     ASTPT = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to the contents of the HDS object, mapped in 'READ'
*        mode.
