      SUBROUTINE COPY3D( DIM1, DIM2, DIM3, ARRIN, ARROUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COPY3D

*  Purpose:
*     copy one 3-D array into another.

*  Language:
*     Starlink

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COPY3D( DIM1, DIM2, DIM3, ARRIN, ARROUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The input 3-D array, ARRIN, of dimensions in DIM1, DIM2, DIM3, is
*     copied into the output 3-D array, ARROUT, of the same dimensions.
*     An immediate return will occur if STATUS has an error value on
*     entry.

*  Arguments:
*     DIM1 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The first dimension of the 2-d arrays.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The second dimension of the 2-d arrays.
*     DIM3 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The third dimension of the 2-d arrays.
*     ARRIN( DIM1, DIM2, DIM3 ) = REAL( READ )
*        Array to be copied.
*     ARROUT( DIM1, DIM2, DIM3 ) = REAL( WRITE )
*        Will be returned containing a copy of the input array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ )
*        This is the global status, if this variable has an error
*          value on entry then an immediate return will occur.

*  Algorithm:
*     If no error on entry then
*        For all bands of the input and output arrays
*           For all the lines of a band
*              For all the points in a line
*                 Output array point is set to value of input array
*                   point
*              Endfor
*           Endfor
*        Endfor
*     Endif
