*  Name:
*     KPG1_WRLST

*  Purpose:
*     Writes a set of positions to a text file as a CAT catalogue.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_WRLST( PARAM, ARRDIM, NPOS, NAX, POS, IFRM, IWCS, TITLE, 
*                      ID0, IDENTS, NULL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine saves a set of positions in a text file as a CAT
*     catalogue (see SUN/181). Information describing associated co-ordinate 
*     Frames can also be stored in the file as textual information, allowing 
*     subsequent applications to interpret the positions. Files written with 
*     this routine can be read using KPG1_RDLST (and also XCATVIEW etc).
*
*     The positions are stored in the file in a Frame selected by the 
*     user using hardwired parameters CATFRAME and CATEPOCH. This Frame
*     defaults to a SKY Frame if present, otherwise a PIXEL Frame if present,
*     otherwise the original Base Frame within the supplied FrameSet. The
*     positions can be supplied within any of the Frames in the FrameSet
*     and will be Mapped into the required Frame if necessary.
*
*     If the ID atttribute of the FrameSet is set to "FIXED_BASE", then
*     the user is not allowed to change the base Frame using parameters 
*     CATFRAME and CATEPOCH.
*
*     See also KPG1_WRTAB, which is like this routine but allows a
*     textual label to be associated with each position.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter to use.
*     ARRDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the first dimension of the positions array. This must 
*        be larger than or equal to NPOS.
*     NPOS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of positions to store in the file.
*     NAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of axes in the Frame specified by IFRM.
*     POS( ARRDIM, NAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The positions to store in the file. POS( I, J ) should give the
*        axis J value for position I. 
*     IFRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the Frame within IWCS to which the supplied
*        positions relate. Can be AST__BASE or AST__CURRENT.
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to an AST FrameSet to store with the positions. 
*     TITLE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A title to store at the top of the text file. Ignored if blank.
*     ID0 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The integer identifier value to associate with the first
*        supplied position. Identifiers for subsequent positions increase
*        by 1 for each position. If this is supplied less than or equal
*        to zero, then its value is ignored and the identifiers supplied
*        in array IDENTS are used instead.
*     IDENTS( NPOS ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The individual integer identifiers to associate with each
*        position. Only accessed if ID0 is less than or equal to zero.
*     NULL = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Is the user allowed to supply a null value? If so, the error
*        status will be annulled before returning.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     15-SEP-1998 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     13-DEC-2001 (DSB):
*        Added facility to specify the Frame in which to store positions
*        in the catalogue.
*     11-JUN-2002 (DSB):
*        Remove code which pre-opened the output catalogue since CAT does
*        not allow a catalogue to be opened more than once. This gave
*        problems when using ICL due to FITS files not being closed
*        properly.
*     2004 September 1 (TIMJ):
*        Use CNF_PVAL
*     1-NOV-2005 (DSB):
*        Allow the calling application to supress the use of the CATEPOCH
*        and CATFRAME parameters by setting the FrameSet ID attribute to
*        "FIXED_BASE".
*     20-NOV-2006 (DSB)
*        Re-implement by calling KPG1_WRTAB.
*     25-JAN-2007 (DSB)
*        Supply a value for argument HIST when calling KPG1_WRTA2.
