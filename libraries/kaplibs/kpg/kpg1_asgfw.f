*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASGFW

*  Purpose:
*     Writes a line of an AST Object description to a GRP group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ASGFW( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine writes a line of an AST Object description to a GRP
*     group, optionally prepending it with the a given string. It is
*     intended to be used as a sink function with AST_CHANNEL.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
