      SUBROUTINE KPG1_GDFNP( NAME, X, Y, IPIC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_GDFNP

*  Purpose:
*     Selects the highest picture of a given name that embraces a
*     position and has WCS.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_GDFNP( NAME, X, Y, IPIC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns an AGI identifier for the youngest picture
*     that has the specified name, embraces the given position and
*     lies within the bounds of the current picture. In this sense it is
*     like AGI_RCLP. However, it also applies an extra requirement that
*     the returned picture should have associated WCS. If no picture with
*     associated WCS can be found, then it abandons this extra requirement
*     and just returns the youngest picture encompassing the supplied
*     position.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the picture to be searched for in the graphics
*        database.
*     X = REAL (Given)
*        X position of test point
*     Y = REAL (Given)
*        Y position of test point
*     IPIC = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The picture identifier of the most-recent picture named NAME.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
