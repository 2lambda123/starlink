*        Original version.
*     13-AUG-2005 (TIMJ):
*        On some compilers comparing a REAL value with an INTEGER
*        derived from a BOZ (HEX) definition, may result in the
*        bit pattern being treated as a REAL rather than the INTEGER
*        value being converted to REAL. To protect against PRM_PAR changing
*        its notation, use the NUM_ macros which force a type conversion.
