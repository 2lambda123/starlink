*  Name:
*     KPG_AST

*  Purpose:
*     Define the KPG library AST common block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global variables include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of AST-related global variables used 
*     internally by the KPG library for things such as local communication 
*     between the KPG library and the "source" and "sink" routines used to 
*     read and write AST_ data from/to HDS objects, GRP groups, etc.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The DAT_PAR include file should be included prior to this file, in 
*     order to define constants which are needed here.

*  Global Variables:
*  ================

*  GRP group identifier.
      INTEGER ASTGRP

*  Maximum length of text to be stored in a GRP element.
      INTEGER ASTTSZ

*  HDS object locator.
      CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) ASTLC

*  Line number of text being read/written.
      INTEGER ASTLN

*  Pointer to mapped HDS _CHAR array data.
      INTEGER ASTPT

*  GRP identifier for a group holding psynonyms for AST attributes.
      INTEGER ASTING

*  GRP identifier for a group holding corresponding AST attribute names.
      INTEGER ASTOUG

*  Number of defined psynonyms.
      INTEGER ASTNPS

*  Character to prepend to each line when writing an AST Object to a GRP group.
      CHARACTER ASTGSP*1

*  Should axes drawn round a Plot annotate the unselected sideband of a 
*  DSBSpecFrame on the unused edge? This is specified by the KAPPA 
*  "pseudo-attribute" DrawDSB which a user can include in a style file 
*  as if it were a genuine AST Plot attribute.
      LOGICAL DRWDSB

*  Should the path to the NDF be included in the Title drawn by graphics 
*  applications such as DISPLAY, LINPLOT, etc? This is specified by the KAPPA 
*  "pseudo-attribute" FileInTitle which a user can include in a style file 
*  as if it were a genuine AST Plot attribute.
      LOGICAL ASTFIT

*  Pointer to an AST KeyMap used to communicate with KPG1_ASPLN.
      INTEGER ASTPLN

*  The X value at the left edge.
      REAL ASTX1

*  The Y value at the bottom edge.
      REAL ASTY1 

*  The X value at the right edge.
      REAL ASTX2 

*  The Y value at the top edge.
      REAL ASTY2 

*  Do not draw lines that touch an edge?
      LOGICAL ASTBLE
