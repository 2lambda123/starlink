      SUBROUTINE KPG1_HSDS<T>( NUMBIN, HIST, HRMIN, HRMAX, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_HSDSx

*  Purpose:
*     Tabulates an histogram.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_HSDSx( NUMBIN, HIST, HRMIN, HRMAX, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine reports an histogram to the user.

*  Arguments:
*     NUMBIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of bins in the histogram.
*     HIST( NUMBIN ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The array holding the histogram.
*     HRMIN = ? (Given)
*        The minimum data value that could be included within the
*        histogram.
*     HRMAX = ? (Given)
*        The maximum data value that could be included within the
*        histogram.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for the following numeric data types:
*     replace "x" in the routine name by D or R as appropriate.  The
*     extreme values of the histogram must have the data type
*     specified.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  If there are insufficient bins report an error and exit.
*     -  Calculate the binsize.
*     -  For each histogram bin report the range and number in the bin.

*  History:
*     1988 July 7 (MJC):
*        Original version called HSTDSP.
*     1992 March 9 (MJC):
*        Made generic, and reordered the NUMBIN argument.  Used SST
*        prologue.
*     2000 February 25 (MJC):
*        Removed heading as it was superfluous and parameter name
*        TITLE clashed with one in HISTOGRAM.
