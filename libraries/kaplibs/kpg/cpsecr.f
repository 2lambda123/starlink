*  Name:
*     CPSECR

*  Purpose:
*     Copy region of 2-D image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink

*  Invocation:
*     CALL  CPSECR( IMAGE, DIM1, DIM2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, RXDIM, RYDIM,

*  Description:
*     This routine copies the 2-D data of a specified region of an
*     image.

*  Arguments:
*     IMAGE( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL( READ )
*        The array containing the raw image data.
*     DIM1 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The first dimension of the 2-d array.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The second dimension of the 2-d array.
*     X1 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The X co-ordinate of the first point from which the region
*          is determined.
*     Y1 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The Y co-ordinate of the first point.
*     X2 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The X co-ordinate of the second point.
*     Y2 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The Y co-ordinate of the second point.
*     RXDIM = INTEGER( READ )
*        The X-dimension of the region.
*     RYDIM = INTEGER( READ )
*        The Y-dimension of the region.
*     REGION( RXDIM, RYDIM ) = REAL( WRITE )
*        The array into which the region is copied.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ )
*        The status value on entry to this routine.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     The maximum and minimum co-ordinates of the region are found.
*     The region is copied by a direct assignment of the data elements
*     concerned to the elements of the new array.

*  History:
*     28 October 1983:
*     1986 Sep 22: Renamed from KFH_TRANSFER2. Standardised to RAPI2D
*        style; renamed parameters section to arguments and
*        added access; region limits now unaltered within
*        routine; argument reordered (8 -> 10); made generic;
*        removed tabs; relocated 'local' variables to import
*        etc.; stripped of trailing blanks and tidied
*        (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1989 Aug  7: Passed array dimensions as separate variables
*        (RL.STAR::CUR).
