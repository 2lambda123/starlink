      SUBROUTINE KPG1_CHEP<T>( X, NTERM, T, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_CHEPx

*  Purpose:
*     Evaluates a Chebyshev polynomial.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_CHEPx( X, NTERM, T, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This evaluates a Chebyshev polynomial for orders zero to NTERM-1
*     at a given normalised [-1,+1] co-ordinate.   It uses a recurrence
*     relationship to evaluate beyond the second term.

*  Arguments:
*     X = ? (Given)
*        The normalised co-ordinate for which the Chebyshev polynomial
*        is to be evaluated.  It is assumed to lie in the range
*        [-1,+1] having been normalised using the limits that created
*        the coefficients.
*     NTERM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of terms in the Chebyshev polynomial.  It equals the
*        order plus one.
*     T( NTERM ) = ? (Returned)
*        The evaluated Chebyshev polynomial for each term.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
