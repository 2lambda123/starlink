*  Name:
*     KPG_PAR

*  Purpose:
*     Define private (internal) constants for the KPG library.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global constants include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of global constants used
*     internally by routines in the KAPPA KPG library.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The SAE_PAR include file should be included prior to this file, in
*     order to define constants which are needed here.

*  Authors:
*     DSB: David S. Berry (STARLINK)

*  History:
*     16-FEB-1998 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     {enter_further_changes_here}

*  Global Constants:

*  World Coordinate Systems.
*  ========================

*  Length of _CHAR array elements used to store AST data in HDS.
      INTEGER KPG__SZAST
      PARAMETER ( KPG__SZAST = 32 )

*  Number of _CHAR array elements initially created when storing AST
*  data in HDS (i.e. an initial guess at the number of lines of data to
*  be stored). The array is expanded if this proves insufficient. It is
*  always truncated after the data have been written.
      INTEGER KPG__INAST
      PARAMETER ( KPG__INAST = 256 )

*  Minimum length of _CHAR array elements accepted as valid when
*  reading AST data that has been stored in HDS.
      INTEGER KPG__MLAST
      PARAMETER ( KPG__MLAST = 16 )

*  Maximum number of continuation lines (i.e. array elements of size
*  KPG__SZAST) to be used when storing a single line of AST data in
*  HDS.  Continuation lines are indicated by a '+' as the first
*  character (normally this is a space). AST data lines which are still
*  too long to be accommodated will cause an error.
      INTEGER KPG__MXACL
      PARAMETER ( KPG__MXACL = 64 )
