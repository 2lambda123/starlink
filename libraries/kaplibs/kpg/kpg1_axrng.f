      SUBROUTINE KPG1_AXRNG( EL, CENTRE, WIDTH, ASTART, AEND, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_AXRNG

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate the extent of an NDF along an axis.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_AXRNG( EL, CENTRE, WIDTH, ASTART, AEND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine calculates the starting and ending positions of an
*     NDF's pixels along an axis, taking account of the axis width
*     values.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in the axis arrays.
*     CENTRE( EL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The centres of the pixels on the axis.
*     WIDTH( EL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The widths of the pixels on the axis.
*     ASTART = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        If the axis centre positions increase with NDF pixel index,
*        this argument returns the axis position of the edge of the
*        first pixel which has the lower co-ordinate. Otherwise it
*        returns the axis position of the edge with the higher
*        co-ordinate.
*     AEND = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        If the axis centre positions increase with NDF pixel index,
*        this argument returns the axis position of the edge of the
*        last pixel which has the higher co-ordinate. Otherwise it
*        returns the axis position of the edge with the lower
*        co-ordinate.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*     1993 January 4 (MJC):
*        Virually re-written, since previous method of passing the lower
*        and upper-bound centres and widths does not work, if there is
*        no width array and the centres are not incremented by one.
*        Uses completely different input arguments.
