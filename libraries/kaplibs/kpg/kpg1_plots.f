      SUBROUTINE KPG1_PLOTS( IPLOT, IPICD, DATREF, ICURR, WDOM, DDOM,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_PLOTS

*  Purpose:
*     Save an AST Plot with an AGI DATA picture.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PLOTS( IPLOT, IPICD, DATREF, ICURR, WDOM, DDOM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine saves a specified Plot and data reference in the AGI 
*     database with a specified DATA picture. A specified Frame can be 
*     made current before saving the Plot.
*
*     If the supplied Plot contains a "AGI Data" Frame with the
*     Domain given by DDOM in which the axes are scaled and shifted
*     versions of the axes of the AGI world co-ordinate Frame
*     (specified by argument WDOM), then a TRANSFORM structure defining 
*     AGI Data co-ordinates is stored with the DATA picture. This is purely 
*     for the benefit of non-AST based applications which may use AGI Data 
*     co-ordinates (AST-based applications should always use the Plot 
*     stored with the picture in preference to the TRANSFORM structure 
*     stored in the AGI database).

*  Arguments:
*     IPLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to the Plot. The current Frame is unchanged on
*        exit (even if a Frame is specified using ICURR).
*     IPICD = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AGI identifier for the DATA picture.
*     DATREF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A data reference to store with the picture.
*     ICURR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index of a Frame to make current before storing the Plot. The
*        supplied current Frame is used if ICURR is AST__NOFRAME.
*     WDOM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The Domain name of the Frame correspondoing to AGI world
*        co-ordinates.
*     DDOM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Domain name of the co-ordinate Frame within IPLOT corresponding 
*        to AGI data co-ordinates. "AXIS" is used if a blank value
*        is supplied.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
