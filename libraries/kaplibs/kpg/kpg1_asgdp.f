      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ASGDP( MAP, NDIM1, NDIM2, LBND, UBND, INPOS, 
     :                       OUTPOS, STATUS )

*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASGDP

*  Purpose:
*     Find a position with good output co-ordinates within a given input
*     region of a supplied Mapping.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ASGDP( MAP, NDIM1, NDIM2, LBND, UBND, INPOS, OUTPOS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine finds a position which has good co-ordinates in the
*     output Frame of the given Mapping, and returns both the input and 
*     output co-ordinates at this position. The position is constrained
*     to lie within a specified box within the input Frame. The first
*     point to be tested is the centre of the box. If this does not give 
*     valid output co-ordinates then a set of 10000 points randomly
*     distributed within the box is tested. An error is reported if no
*     good position can be found.

*  Arguments:
*     MAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The Mapping to use.
*     NDIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of input co-ordinates.
*     NDIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of output co-ordinates.
*     LBND( NDIM1 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The lower bounds of the test box, within the input Frame of the
*        supplied Mapping.
*     UBND( NDIM1 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The upper bounds of the test box, within the input Frame of the
*        supplied Mapping.
*     INPOS( NDIM1 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The returned input co-ordinates at the selected position.
*        There will be no AST__BAD values in this array.
*     OUTPOS( NDIM2 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The returned output co-ordinates at the selected position.
*        There will be no AST__BAD values in this array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
