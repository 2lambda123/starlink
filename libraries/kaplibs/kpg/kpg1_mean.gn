      SUBROUTINE KPG1_MEAN<T>( N, DATA, MEAN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_MEANx
 
*  Purpose:
*     Finds the mean of the good data values in an array.

*  Description:
*     Finds the mean of the good data values in an array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation
*     CALL KPG1_MEANx( N, DATA, MEAN, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of elements in the array.
*     DATA( N ) = ? (Given)
*        The data array.
*     MEAN = ? (Returned)
*        The mean value.  Set to VAL__BAD<T> if no good data are found.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each of the standard numeric types.
*     Replace "x" in the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as
*     appropriate.    The array and mean arguments supplied to the
*     routine must have the data type specified.
*     -  The summation is carried out in double precision.
