      SUBROUTINE KPG1_AGREF( PICID, ACCESS, THERE, NAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_AGREF

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a name of or a locator to an object referenced in the
*     graphics database.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_AGREF( PICID, ACCESS, THERE, NAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines whether a given picture in the AGI
*     graphics database has an object associated with it by reference.
*     If it has, the name of the object or a locator to the object is
*     returned with the desired access mode.

*  Arguments:
*     PICID = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the picture with which a data object may
*        be associated by reference.
*     ACCESS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Access mode to the object: 'READ', 'WRITE' or 'UPDATE'.
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true the picture has an associated object and the returned
*        name is meaningful.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The name of the data object referenced by picture PICID, or a
*        locator to that object.  It should be ignored if THERE is
*        .FALSE..  The value should be tested to see if it a locator or
*        a name.  If it is a locator, it should be annulled by
*        REF_ANNUL.  A reasonable number of characters should be allowed
*        to accommodate a name including its path and section.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The code is a little convoluted because of a bug in AGI_GTREF
*     which means that a long name cannot be passed to it, if the
*     reference is via a locator.

*  Initialise the flag.
      THERE = .FALSE.

*  Get the locator to, or the name (with length of no more than
*  DAT__SZLOC) of, the NDF associated with the DATA picture.
      CALL AGI_GTREF( PICID, ACCESS, LOC, STATUS )

*  The string was truncated implying the reference object is a name,
*  and not a locator.  So annul the error and get the name.
      IF ( STATUS .EQ. DAT__TRUNC ) THEN
         CALL ERR_ANNUL( STATUS )

*  Obtain this name of the NDF associated with the DATA picture.
         CALL AGI_GTREF( PICID, ACCESS, NAME, STATUS )

*  Check the status to double-check that a reference was found, and
*  isn't still too long.  If there was another error we handle it
*  transparently, since we can ask for an input NDF.
         IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK .AND.  STATUS .NE. DAT__TRUNC ) THEN
            CALL ERR_ANNUL( STATUS )
         ELSE

*  The reference is still truncated, but continue, as it may be better
*  than no reference, and KPG1_ASREF will complain.
            IF ( STATUS .EQ. DAT__TRUNC ) CALL ERR_ANNUL( STATUS )

*  Record that a reference name was found, albeit truncated in some
*  cases.
            THERE = .TRUE.
         END IF

*  Check the status to determine whether or not a reference was found.
      ELSE IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) THEN

*  Not found, but since we can ask for an input NDF the error can be handled
*  transparently.
         CALL ERR_ANNUL( STATUS )

      ELSE

*  Record that the locator or short-length name was found by reference.
*  It may be needed to avoid obtaining the object again, and will be
*  required to annul the locator via REF, if that is what it is.
*  Transfer the locator or name to the returned argument.
         THERE = .TRUE.
         NAME = LOC

      END IF

*  Release the error context.
