      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ASGFR( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASGFR

*  Purpose:
*     Reads a line of an AST Object description from a GRP group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ASGFR( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine reads a line of an AST Object description from a GRP
*     group, removing the first character if it is a "#" or a "!". It then
*     returns the line of text to the AST library using AST_PUTLINE. It is
*     intended to be used as a source function with AST_CHANNEL.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
