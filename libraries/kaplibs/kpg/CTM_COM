*  Name:
*     CTM_COM

*  Purpose:
*     Declares common block used to communicate the KAPPA standard
*     colour set.

*  Notes:
*     -  CTM_PAR must be included in routines that access the CTM
*     common block.
*     -  In BLOCK DATA the RGB array is broken into two because of the
*     restriction of 19 continuation lines.  It therefore does not
*     include this routine, and any changes here must be reflected in
*     CTM_XCOLS.

*  History:
*     1991 July 19 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1992 March 16 (MJC):
*        Split the common block from CTM_COLOURSET to CTM_COLNM and
*        CTM_COLIN in order to separate the characters from the
*        floating-point values as permitted by the standard.
*     1992 March 27 (MJC):
*        Increased the size of the names to twenty for the MIT colour
*        set, and also added facility prefix to the common variables.
