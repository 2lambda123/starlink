      SUBROUTINE ZERO2D( DIM1, DIM2, ARRAY, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ZERO2D

*  Purpose:
*     sets all elements of a 2-dimensional array to zero.

*  Language:
*     Starlink

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ZERO2D( DIM1, DIM2, ARRAY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     All elements of the 2-dimensional array, ARRAY, are set equal to
*     zero. An immediate return will occur if STATUS has an error value
*     on entry.

*  Arguments:
*     DIM1 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The first dimension of the 2-d array to be set to all zeros.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The second dimension of the 2-d array to be set to all zeros.
*     ARRAY( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL( UPDATE )
*        All elements of this array will be set to zero.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ )
*        This is the global status, if this variable has an error
*        value on entry then an immediate return will occur.

*  Algorithm:
*     If no error on entry then
*        For all rows of the array
*           For all elements in a row
*              Value of element becomes zero
*           Endfor
*        Endfor
*     Endif
