      SUBROUTINE KPG1_PRNTH( STRING, OP, CL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_PRNTH

*  Purpose:
*     Locates the outer-most pair of parenthesis in a string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PRNTH( STRING, OP, CL STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine returns the indices of the first opening parenthesis and
*     the last closing parenthesis in the supplied string. Both are
*     returned equal to zero if either parenthesis is not found.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        String to be searched.
*     OP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Position within STRING at which the first occurence of "(" is
*        located.
*     CL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Position within STRING at which the last occurence of ")" is
*        located.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Check the inherited global status.

* Only continue if it was found.
      IF( OP .GT. 0 ) THEN

*  Find the last closing parenthesis in the string following the
*  opening parenthesis.
         CL = 0

*  If not found, return zero for the index of the opening parenthesis.
