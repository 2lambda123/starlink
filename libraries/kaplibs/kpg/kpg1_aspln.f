      INTEGER FUNCTION KPG1_ASPLN( GRFCON, N, X, Y )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASPLN

*  Purpose:
*     Draw a line for an AST Plot and log it at the same time.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = KPG1_ASPLN( GRFCON, N, X, Y )

*  Description:
*     This routine is intended to be registered with an AST Plot (using 
*     AST_GRFSET) so that it is subsequently used to draw all lines. When
*     called by AST, it calls the underlying PGPLOT line drawing function 
*     to draw the polyline specified by N, X and Y, and then records the 
*     details of the drawn polyline in an AST KeyMap (previously specified 
*     by calling KPG1_ASPLG). This KeyMap can then be interogated in order 
*     to determine what lines were drawn. A new entry is added to the
*     KeyMap each time this function is called. Each such entry is itself
*     a KeyMap containing three entries with keys "N", "X" and "Y". The "N"
*     entry is a scalar integer holding the corresponding N value, and
*     the other two are single precision vector entries holding the X and
*     Y values.
*
*     KPG1_ASPLG should be called prior to registering this function
*     using AST_GRFSET.

*  Arguments:
*     GRFCON = INTEGER (Given)
*        A KeyMap containing information passed from the calling application.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pointsin the polyline.
*     X( N ) = REAL (Given)
*        The graphics X coord at each point on the polyline.
*     Y( N ) = REAL (Given)
*        The graphics Y coord at each point on the polyline.

*  Notes:
*     -  The PGPLOT interface to the AGI library should be opened before
*     calling this routine.
