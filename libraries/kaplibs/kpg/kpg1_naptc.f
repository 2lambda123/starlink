      SUBROUTINE KPG1_NAPTC( CVALUE, LOC, NDIM, DIM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_NAPTC

*  Purpose:
*     Swaps argument order when putting a mapped character array into
*     an HDS object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_NAPTC( CVALUE, LOC, NDIM, DIM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This is just a dummy routine to swap the argument order when
*     putting the value of a mapped character array into HDS object.  It
*     is needed for Unix systems.

*  Arguments:
*     CVALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The character value.
*     LOC = CHARACTER * (DAT__SZLOC) (Given)
*        The locator of the object to have value CVALUE.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions.
*     DIM( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensions of the character object.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
