      SUBROUTINE KPG1_SGDIM( NDF, NDIM, DIMV, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_SGDIM

*  Purpose:
*     Determines the number of significant dimensions in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_SGDIM( NDF, NDIM, DIMV, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine finds the number of significant dimensions, i.e.
*     those with greater than one element, in an NDF.  If the number
*     found is not equal to a specified number a bad status, SAI_ERROR,
*     is returned.  Likewise should there be no significant dimensions.
*     The significant dimensions are recorded and returned.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The desired number of dimensions.
*     DIMV( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The significant dimensions i.e. the ones that are greater than
*        one.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The NDF must exist.

*  History:
*     1991 February 11 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1992 April 16 (MJC):
*        Added NDF token to the error reports.
*     15-JUN-1998 (DSB):
*        Modified to avoid addressing DIMV outside the range [1-NDIM].
*        Converted to modern style layout.

*  Type Definitions:

*  Global Constants:
      INCLUDE 'SAE_PAR'          ! Standard SAE constants
      INCLUDE 'NDF_PAR'          ! NDF constants

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER NDF

*  Arguments Returned:

*  Status:
      INTEGER STATUS             ! Global status

*  Local Variables:
