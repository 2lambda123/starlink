F77_SUBROUTINE(kpg1_kygrp)( INTEGER(KEYMAP), INTEGER(IGRP), INTEGER(STATUS) ) {
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_KYGRP

*  Purpose:
*     Create an GRP group holding keyword/value pairs read from an AST
*     KeyMap.

*  Language:
*     C, designed to be called from Fortran.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_KYGRP( KEYMAP, IGRP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This function is the inverse of KPG1_KYMAP. It extracts the values
*     from the supplied AST KeyMap and creates a set of "name=value" strings
*     which it appends to a supplied group (or creates a new group). If
*     the KeyMap contains nested KeyMaps, then the "name" associated with
*     each primitive value stored in the returned group is a hierarchical
*     list of component names separated by dots.

*  Arguments:
*     KEYMAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to the existing KeyMap. Numerical entries which
*        have bad values (VAL__BADI for integer entries or VAL__BADD for
*        floating point entries) are not copied into the group.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP identifier for the group to which to append the "name=value"
*        strings read from the KeyMap. A new group is created if GRP__NOID
*        is supplied.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
