      SUBROUTINE KPG1_RDTAB( PARAM, CURFRM, LABS, IWCS, NPOS, NAX,
     :                       IPPOS, IPID, TITLE, NAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_RDTAB

*  Purpose:
*     Reads a set of positions with labels from a CAT catalogue.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_RDTAB( PARAM, CURFRM, LABS, IWCS, NPOS, NAX, IPPOS,
*                      IPID, TITLE, NAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine is equivalent to KPG1_RDLST except that any labels
*     stored with the positions in the catalogue are returned in a GRP
*     group (see LABS). The labels must be stored in a column called
*     "LABEL". Catalogues containing such labels are written by KPG1_WRTAB.
*
*     See KPG1_RDLST for further information.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter to use.
*     CURFRM = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE. the positions read from the catalogue are Mapped
*        into the Current Frame of the associated FrameSet before being
*        returned. Otherwise, they are returned in the Base Frame.
*     LABS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        A GRP identifier for a group containing the values in the LABEL
*        column. If the catalogue contains a LABEL column, then its values
*        are appended to the end of the supplied group. If LABS holds
*        GRP__NOID on entry, then a new GRP group is created and its
*        identifier returned in LABS, but only if the catalogue contains
*        a LABEL column (otherwise the supplied value of GRP__NOID is
*        retained on exit).
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AST pointer to the FrameSet read from the catalogue.
*     NPOS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of positions returned.
*     NAX = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of axes in the Frame requested by CURFRM.
*     IPPOS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to a 2-dimensional DOUBLE PRECISION array holding the
*        returned positions. Element (I,J) of this array gives axis J for
*        position I. The first axis will have NPOS elements, and the
*        second will have NAX elements. Should be released using PSX_FREE
*        when no longer needed.
*     IPID = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to a 1-dimensional INTEGER array holding the integer
*        identifiers for the returned positions. The array will have NPOS
*        elements. Should be released using PSX_FREE when no longer needed.
*     TITLE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The value of the TITLE parameter in the supplied catalogue.
*        Returned blank if there is no TITLE parameter.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The file spec of the catalogue containing the positions list.
*        Not accessed if the declared length is 1.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
