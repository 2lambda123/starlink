      SUBROUTINE COPY1D( DIM, ARRIN, ARROUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COPY1D

*  Purpose:
*     copy one 1-D array to another.

*  Language:
*     Starlink F77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COPY1D( DIM, ARRIN, ARROUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The input 1-D array, ARRIN, of dimension DIM, is copied into the
*     output 1-D array, ARROUT, of the same dimension.
*     An immediate return will occur if STATUS has an error value on
*     entry.

*  Arguments:
*     DIM = INTEGER( READ )
*        Dimension of the input and output arrays.
*     ARRIN( DIM ) = REAL( READ )
*        1-D array to be copied.
*     ARROUT( DIM ) = REAL( WRITE )
*        Output array is returned as a copy of the input array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ )
*        This is the global status, if this variable has an error
*        value on entry then an immediate return will occur.

*  Algorithm:
*     If no error on entry then
*        For all points in the input array
*           Output array point is set to value of input array point.
*        Endfor
*     Endif
