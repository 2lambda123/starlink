      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ASPLT( IWCS, BOX, OPTS, IPLOT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASPLT

*  Purpose:
*     Create an AST Plot covering the current PGPLOT viewport.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ASPLT(  IWCS, BOX, OPTS, IPLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine create a Plot covering the current PGPLOT viewport.
*     The bounds of the PGPLOT window are changed if necessary to ensure 
*     that the PGPLOT world co-ordinate system corresponds to milliemtres 
*     from the bottom left corner of the view surface. This is the
*     co-ordinate system used in the Base (GRAPHICS) Frame of the returned 
*     Plot.

*  Arguments:
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FrameSet to include in the Plot. May be AST__NULL.
*     BOX( 4 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        An array holding the bounds of the area within the Base Frame of
*        IWCS which is to be mapped linearly onto the current PGPLOT
*        viewport. The first pair of values should give the coordinates at
*        the bottom left corner of the plotting area and the second pair 
*        should give the coordinates at the top right corner. The coordinate 
*        on the horizontal axis should be given first in each pair.
*     OPTS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A set of Plot attribute settings to be used when creating the
*        Plot.
*     IPLOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AST pointer to the Plot. Returned equal to AST__NULL if an 
*        error occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The PGPLOT interface to the AGI library should be opened before
*     calling this routine.
