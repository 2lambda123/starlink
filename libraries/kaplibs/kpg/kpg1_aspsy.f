      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ASPSY( SYNON, TRAN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASPSY

*  Purpose:
*     Establish synonyms for AST attribute names.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ASPSY( SYNON, TRAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine establishes synonyms for AST attribute names or
*     attribute qualifiers (qualifiers are strings in parenthesise following
*     the attribute name - the "graphical elements" used by some Plot
*     attributes are examples of qualifiers). The routine KPG1_ASCHP is
*     used to translated synonyms into values recognised by AST.
*
*     Note, substitutions for synonyms are performed in the order in
*     which they are defined, with later substitutions potentially
*     modifying the results of earlier substitutions. For this reason,
*     synonyms for specific name/qualifer pairs (eg "FORMAT(VEC*TOR)" )
*     should be defined *before* synonyms for qualifiers alone (eg
*     "(VEC*TOR)" ). If these two examples were defined in the opposite
*     order, then the qualifier in FORMAT(VEC) (i.e. "VEC") would get
*     replaced by the translation supplied for synonym "(VEC*TOR)", so
*     that the resulting string would then fail to match the synonym
*     "FORMAT(VEC*TOR)" and so would not result in the correct translation.

*  Arguments:
*     SYNON = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A synonym for an AST attribute name and/or qualifier. The
*        supplied value is converted to upper case, and stripped of spaces.
*        If the synonym contains just a qualifier (i.e. no attribute
*        name), then KPG1_ASCHP will substitute the qualifier from the
*        translation irespective of the attribute name. Minimum
*        abbreviations for attribute qualifiers may be given by including
*        an asterisk in the qualifier to mark the end of the minimum
*        abbreviation. If a blank value is supplied, then the resources used
*        to store the synonyms and translations are released.
*     TRAN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The translation for the supplied synonym. This should be a legal
*        AST attribute name/qualifier combination (but no check is made
*        on this). The supplied value is converted to upper case, and
*        stripped of spaces.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
