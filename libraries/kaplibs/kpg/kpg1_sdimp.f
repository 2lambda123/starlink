      SUBROUTINE KPG1_SDIMP( NDF, NDIM, DIMV, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_SDIMP

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains up to a number of significant dimensions of an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_SDIMP( NDF, NDIM, DIMV, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine finds the dimensions which are significant in an
*     NDF, i.e. those with greater than one element.  The significant
*     dimensions are recorded and returned.  If the number of
*     significant dimensions found is less than a specified value, the
*     insignificant dimensions pad out the array of dimension indices
*     returned; and all the dimensions are returned in order of
*     increasing dimensionality.  However, should the number of
*     significant dimensions exceed the required number a bad status,
*     SAI_ERROR, is returned.  Likewise there is an error when there
*     are no significant dimensions.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The desired number of dimensions.
*     DIMV( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The significant dimensions i.e. the ones that are greater than
*        one.  There is an execption when there are fewer than NDIM
*        present in the NDF, whereupon this array includes in dimension
*        order those that are insignificant too.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The NDF must exist.
