      SUBROUTINE KPG1_GNDFP( PARNDF, PARPAX, NDIM, MODE, INDF, SDIM,

*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_GNDFP

*  Purpose:
*     Gets an NDF or NDF section with a specified number of significant
*     dimensions, but also may select one further significant iteration
*     dimension.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_GNDFP( PARNDF, PARPAX, NDIM, MODE, INDF, SDIM, LBND,
*                      UBND, PERPAX, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied parameter name PARNDF is associated with an NDF
*     through the environment, and an identifier is obtained for the NDF
*     using the specified access mode.  Each axis of the NDF is checked
*     to see if is significant (i.e. has a size greater than 1).  The
*     index of each significant axis is returned in SDIM; and the bounds
*     of the axes are returned in LBND and UBND.  If the number of
*     significant axes is exactly one more than NDIM, one axis may be
*     chosen for later iteration over `planes' of NDIM dimensions.
*     If there are fewer than NDIM significant dimensions then the
*     insignificant dimensions are used (starting from the lowest) to
*     ensure that the required number of dimensions are returned.

*  Arguments:
*     PARNDF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter name to obtain the NDF.
*     PARPAX = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter name to obtain the axis to iterate over the
*        `planes'.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions required.
*     MODE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The access mode required for the NDF.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An identifier for the NDF.
*     SDIM( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The indices of the significant dimensions.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The lower bounds of the NDF.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The upper bounds of the NDF.
*     PERPAX = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index of the axis perpendicular to the `plane' if there is
*        exactly one more significant axis than NDIM, otherwise set to
*        zero.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
