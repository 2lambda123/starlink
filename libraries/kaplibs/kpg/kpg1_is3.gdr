      SUBROUTINE KPG1_IS3<T>( ORDDAT, DDAT, PDAT, NENT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_IS3x

*  Purpose:
*     Sorts an array of data into increasing order, also shuffling
*     two ancillary arrays correspondingly.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_IS3x( ORDDAT, DDAT, PDAT, NENT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine uses an insert sort method. This has proven itself
*     the quickest for sorting small sets of data lots of times, as in
*     image stacking using ordered statistics. The method looks at the
*     second value, compares this with the first if swaps if necessary,
*     then it looks at the third, looks at the previous values swaps
*     with the lowest (or not at all) and so on until all values have
*     been passed. It is fast (for the case above ) simply because of
*     the very few lines of operation. The sort is extended to the
*     ancillary data DDAT, and PDAT these maintain their
*     correspondence with the ORDDAT dataset on exit.

*  Arguments:
*     ORDDAT( NENT ) = ? (Given and Returned)
*        The data to order. On output it contains the data in increasing
*        order.
*     DDAT( NENT ) = ? (Given and Returned)
*        A list of data associated with ORDDAT which needs to retain its
*        correspondence with the items in ORDDAT.
*     PDAT( NENT ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        A list of data associated with ORDDAT which needs to retain its
*        correspondence with the items in ORDDAT (probably pointers).
*     NENT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of entries in ORDDAT.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for the double-precision and real
*     floating-point data types: replace "x" in the routine name by 
*     D or R as appropriate.  The ORDDAT and DDAT arrays must have the 
*     data type specified.
