      SUBROUTINE COPA<T>( DIM, ARRIN, ARROUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COPA<T>

*  Purpose:
*     Copy a one-dimensional array.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COPA<T>( DIM, ARRIN, ARROUT, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     DIM = INTEGER ( READ )
*           Dimension of the input and output arrays.
*     ARRIN( DIM ) = <TYPE> ( READ )
*           1-D array to be copied.
*     ARROUT( DIM ) = <TYPE> ( WRITE )
*           Output array is returned as a copy of the input array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     The input one-dimensional array, ARRIN, of dimension DIM, is 
*     copied into the output one-dimensional array, ARROUT, of the same 
*     dimension.  An immediate return will occur if STATUS has an error
*     value on entry.
