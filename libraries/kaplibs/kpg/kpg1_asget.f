      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ASGET( INDF, NDIM, EXACT, TRIM, REQINV, SDIM,

*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASGET

*  Purpose:
*     Gets an AST FrameSet from the WCS component of an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ASGET( INDF, NDIM, EXACT, TRIM, REQINV, SDIM, SLBND, SUBND,
*                      IWCS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines the axes to be used from an NDF and returns a
*     FrameSet representing the WCS information in the NDF.
*
*     Each axis of the supplied NDF is checked to see if it is significant
*     (i.e. has a size greater than 1).  The index of each significant axis
*     is returned in SDIM, and the bounds of the axis are returned in SLBND
*     and SUBND.  If EXACT is .TRUE., an error is reported if the number of
*     significant axes is not exactly NDIM.  This mode is intended for case
*     where (say) the user has supplied a single plane from a 3D data cube
*     to an application which requires a 2D array.
*
*     If EXACT is .FALSE. an error is only reported if the number of
*     significant dimensions is higher than NDIM.  If there are less than
*     NDIM significant dimensions then the insignificant dimensions are
*     used (starting from the lowest) to ensure that the required number
*     of dimensions are returned. This mode is intended for cases where (say)
*     the user supplies a 1D data stream to an application which requires a
*     2D array.
*
*     The GRID Frame (i.e. the Base Frame) obtained from the NDFs WCS
*     component is modified so that it has NDIM axes corresponding to the
*     axes returned in SDIM (the value 1.0 is used for the other axes).
*
*     Likewise, the PIXEL Frame obtained from the NDFs WCS component is
*     modified so that it has NDIM axes corresponding to the axes returned
*     in SDIM (the lower pixel bound is used for the other axes). The
*     original PIXEL Frame is retained, but with Domain changed to
*     NDF_PIXEL.
*
*     If TRIM is .TRUE., then the Current Frame obtained from the NDFs WCS
*     component is also modified so that it has NDIM axes. If the original
*     Current Frame has more than NDIM axes, then the axes to use are
*     obtained from the environment using parameter USEAXIS. A new Current
*     Frame is then made by picking these axes from the original Current
*     Frame, assigning the value AST__BAD to the axes which have not been
*     chosen.
*
*     If the original Current Frame has less than NDIM axes, then simple
*     axes are added into the new Current Frame to make up a total of
*     NDIM. These axes are given the value 1.0.
*
*     Various environment parameters may be used to obtain options, etc. The
*     names of these parameters are hard-wired into this subroutine in
*     order to ensure conformity between applications.

*  Environment Parameters:
*     USEAXIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A set of NDIM axes to be selected from the Current Frame. Each
*        axis can be specified either by giving its index within the Current
*        Frame in the range 1 to the number of axes in the Frame, or by
*        giving its symbol. This parameter is only accessed if TRIM is
*        .TRUE. and the original Current Frame in the supplied NDF has
*        too many axes. The dynamic default selects the axes with the same
*        indices as the selected NDF axes. The value should be given as a
*        GRP group expression, with default control characters.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier for the NDF.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions required by the application.
*     EXACT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Must the NDF have exactly NDIM significant axes? Otherwise it is
*        acceptable for the NDIM axes to include some insignificant axes.
*     TRIM = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Should the returned FrameSet be trimmed to ensure that the
*        Current Frame has NDIM axes? Otherwise, the Current Frame read
*        from the NDF is not changed.
*     REQINV = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Is the inverse mapping (from Current Frame to Base Frame)
*        required? If it is, an error is reported if the inverse mapping
*        is not available. REQINV should be supplied .TRUE. in most cases.
*     SDIM( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The indices of the significant dimensions.
*     SLBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of the significant dimensions.  These
*        are stored in the same order as the indices in SDIM.
*     SUBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of the significant dimensions.  These
*        are stored in the same order as the indices in SDIM.
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AST pointer to the WCS FrameSet. Returned equal to AST__NULL
*        if an error occurs. The Base Frame is an NDIM-dimensional GRID
*        Domain.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the Current Frame in the returned FrameSet has no Title, then
*     the Title is set to the value of the NDF TITLE component (so long
*     as the NDF TITLE is not blank or undefined).

*  History:
*     30-JUN-1998 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     22-JUN-1999 (DSB):
*        Remove call to NDF_SECT which set the pixel bounds fo all
*        insignificant axes to (1:1).
*     15-JAN-2000 (DSB):
*        Do not remove insignificant axes from the current Frame if TRIM
*        indicates that a precise number of axes is required in the
*        current Frame.
*     30-AUG-2004 (DSB):
*        Replaced hardwired "3" by "NDIMS" in call to KPG1_ASSIG!
*     2-DEC-2005 (DSB):
*        Added INPRM to argument list for KPG1_ASTRM.
*     14-FEB-2006 (DSB):
*        Ensure INPRM is initialised even if NDIM is equal to NBAX. Lack
*        of initialisation caused KPG1_ASTRM to crash in the case where
*        NDIM and NBAX are equal.
*     12-SEP-2006 (DSB):
*        If the current Frame is AXIS and the AXIS structures are
*        non-monotonic, reset the current Frame to PIXEL.
*     16-NOV-2006 (PWD):
*        Stop modfication of NDIM given argument in call to NDF_BOUND.
*     19-AUG-2010 (DSB):
*        Add SDIM argument to KPG1_ASNDF.
