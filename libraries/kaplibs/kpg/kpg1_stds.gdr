*  Description:
*     This routine displays the statistics of pixel data as generated by
*     the routines KPG1_STATx, KPG_OSTAx, and KPG1_HSTAx.

*  Arguments:
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to WCS FrameSet.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of dimensions of the array whose statistics are being
*        displayed.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        Total number of pixels in the array.
*     NGOOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of valid pixels which contributed to the statistics.
*     DMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Minimum pixel value.
*     MINP( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pixel indices at which the minimum pixel value was (first)
*        found.
*     MINC( NDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The co-ordinate values of the centre of the minimum pixel.
*     DMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Maximum pixel value.
*     MAXP( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pixel indices at which the maximum pixel value was (first)
*        found.
*     MAXC( NDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The co-ordinate values of the centre of the maximum pixel.
*     SUM = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Pixel sum.
*     MEAN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Pixel mean value.
*     STDEV = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Pixel standard deviation value.
*     SKEW = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Skewness of the pixel values.
*     KURTOS = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Pixel kurtosis.
*     MEDIAN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Median value.
*     MODE = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Modal value.
*     NUMPER = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of percentiles values to report.
*     PERCNT( NUMPER ) = REAL (Given)
*        The array of percentiles levels corresponding to the values
*        given by PERVAL.  They should be in the range 0.0 to 100.0,
*        and preferably in ascending order.  If there are none to
*        report, set NUMPER to 1 and pass the bad value in PERCNT( 1 ).
*     PERVAL( NUMPER ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Percentile values corresponding to the percentile fractions
*        in PERCNT.
*     MAXWCS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The formatted WCS co-ordinates at the minimum position.
*     MINWCS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The formatted WCS co-ordinates at the minimum position.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for both real and double-precision
*     statistics: replace "x" in the routine name by R or D as
*     appropriate. Note that the two routines have identical argument
*     lists (with floating-point qualitities in double precision) but
*     differ in the precision with which the results are displayed.
*     -  If the value of NGOOD is not positive, then this routine will
*     assume that all the derived statistics (except for the sum) are
*     undefined and will not display them.
*     -  If a statistic is undefined, i.e. has the bad value, it is
*     not reported.  In the case of arrays, the first value is checked.
*     For the co-ordinates and pixel indices of the extreme values both
*     of the first elements of these must be good to display these
*     positions.

*  History:
*     1988 February 19 (MJC):
*        First implementation.
*     1990 January 23 (MJC):
*        No report for invalid pixels for negative number.
*     1990 March 8 (MJC):
*        Added extra arguments to output the co-ordinates of the
*        maximum and minimum values.
*     1991 March 18 (RFWS):
*        Changed to handle new data from the generic version of the
*        statistics generating routine.
*     1991 March 27 (RFWS):
*        Converted to a generic routine, handling R and D precisions.
*        Supressed display of undefined statistics.
*     1996 March 11 (MJC):
*        Redo addition of the ordered statistics and checking for bad
*        values (originally around 1993).
*     6-AUG-2004 (DSB):
*        Re-instated generic source and added argument IWCS. Display WCS
*        co-ordinates instead of AXIS co-ordinates.
*     6-JAN-2006 (DSB):
*        Normalise WCS co-ordinates before displaying them.
*     18-MAY-2007 (DSB):
*        Added arguments MINWCS and MAXWCS.
*     2010 July 21 (MJC):
*        Added and reported arguments SKEW and KURTOS.
*     2018 January 20 (MJC):
*        Initialise returned values before the status check.  A WCS
*        string could be undefined if its corresponding value is bad.
*     5-DEC-2019 (DSB):
*        Support huge files.
