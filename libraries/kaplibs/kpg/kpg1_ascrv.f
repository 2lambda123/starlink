      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ASCRV( IPLOT, FAST, N, X, Y, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ASCRV

*  Purpose:
*     Draw a polyline using AST.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ASCRV( IPLOT, FAST, N, X, Y, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine draw a polyline between the supplied positions. These
*     positions are presumed to refer to the (2D) Current coordinate Frame 
*     in the supplied AST Plot. 
*
*     If FAST is .TRUE., the supplied positions are transformed into 
*     graphics coordinates, and the polyline is then drawn as a series 
*     of straight line segments using PGPLOT directly. Drawing performed 
*     with FAST = .TRUE. is buffered to increase efficiency. Call this 
*     routine with N=0 to flush the buffer. 
*
*     If FAST is .FALSE., AST_CURVE is used to draw the polyline as a
*     series of geodesic curves in the Current Frame of the Plot. This
*     will take into account any discontinuities in the Mapping from
*     the Current Frame to the graphics coordinate Frame, but will be
*     slower.

*  Arguments:
*     IPLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to a Plot.
*     FAST = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Is faster plotting required?
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of points in the polyline. Zero to flush the buffer
*        when drawing in fast mode.
*     X( N ) = REAL (Given)
*        The X coordinates at the polyline points, in the Current Frame of
*        the Plot.
*     Y( N ) = REAL (Given)
*        The Y coordinates at the polyline points, in the Current Frame of
*        the Plot.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*     8-DEC-1998 (DSB):

*        Use different arrays for input and output when calling AST_TRANx.
