      REAL FUNCTION KPG1_SEED( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_SEED

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain a semi-random seed for random-number generation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = KPG1_SEED( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This function uses the computer time from an arbitrary date, plus
*     the current process id., to generate a non-repeatable seed.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     KPG1_SEED = REAL
*        The non-repeatable seed for use in SLA_RANDOM.  Note that
*        it is not necessarily in the range 0 to 1.

*  Local Variables:
      INTEGER NTICKS             ! Number of computer clock ticks
      INTEGER PID                ! Process id.
      LOGICAL DONE               ! Has seed been set before?
      REAL SEED                  ! The returned seed

*  Ensure DONE is set false on the first call to this routine for 
*  each process. Ensure the flag and seed values are retained for 
*  future invocations.
      DATA DONE /.FALSE./
      SAVE DONE, SEED
*.

*  Check the inherited status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  If the seed has already been set, just update the previous seed by a 
*  random amount.
      IF( DONE ) THEN
         SEED = 2*SEED*SLA_RANDOM( SEED )

*  If this is the first time the seed has been set in this process...
      ELSE

*  Obtain the computer time since an arbitrary epoch, in seconds.
         CALL PSX_TIME( NTICKS, STATUS )

*  Obtain the process id as an integer.
         CALL PSX_GETPID( PID, STATUS )

*  Generate the seed as an odd number.  The process id is included 
*  because the ticks are in seconds.  On modern machines the 
*  application may be called several times each second, and so the same 
*  seed would be used if it depended on NTICKS alone.  Including the PID
*  causes different seeds to be used each time because the PIDs will be 
*  different.  If the application is run repeatedly in the same process
*  (e.g. ICL), then the seed will be set in the above (DONE=.TRUE.) 
*  block.
         SEED = REAL( ( MOD( NTICKS, NORM ) + 100*PID )* 2 + 1 )

*  Indicate the seed has been set.
         DONE = .TRUE.

      END IF

*  Return the seed value
      KPG1_SEED = SEED
