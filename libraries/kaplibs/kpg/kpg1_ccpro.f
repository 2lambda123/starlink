      SUBROUTINE KPG1_CCPRO( PNCOMP, COMP, NDFI, NDFO, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_CCPRO

*  Purpose:
*     Gets a character component for an output NDF with optional
*     propagation from another NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_CCPRO( PNCOMP, COMP, NDFI, NDFO, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine uses the parameter sysyem to obtain a value for a
*     selected character component of an output or updated NDF.  If the
*     null value is supplied, the character component is copied from
*     an input NDF to the output NDF, unless the component is undefined,
*     in the input, in which case it is left undefined in the output.

*  Arguments:
*     PNCOMP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter used to obtain the character
*        component's value.
*     COMP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the character component.  It must be 'TITLE',
*        'LABEL', or 'UNITS'.
*     NDFI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the input NDF from which a character
*        component is to be copied to the output NDF.
*     NDFO = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the output or updated NDF to which a
*        character component is to be written.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     1994 September 27 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     9-JAN-2001 (DSB):
*        Changed behaviour so that the component is left undefined in
*        the output NDF (rather than being set blank) if a null
*        parameter value is supplied, and no component exists in the
*        input NDF.
*     2008 June 17 (MJC):
*        Trim trailing blanks from output NDF character components.
