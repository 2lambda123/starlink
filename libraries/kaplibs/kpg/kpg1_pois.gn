      SUBROUTINE KPG1_POIS<T>( EL, VALUES, SEED, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_POISx

*  Purpose:
*     Takes values and returns them with Poisson noise added.

*  Language:
*     Starlin Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_POISx( EL, VALUES, SEED, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine adds or subtracts pseudo-random Poissonian (shot)
*     noise to a series of values.  It uses a Box-Mueller algorithm to
*     generate a fairly good normal distribution.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of values to which to add Poisson noise.
*     VALUES( EL )  =  ? (Given and Returned)
*        On input these are the value to which noise is to be applied.
*        On return the values have the noise applied.
*     SEED  =  REAL (Given & Returned)
*        The seed for random number generator; updated by the
*        random-number generator.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric data type: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as appropriate. The
*     array supplied to the routine must have the data type specified.
*     -  There is no checking for overflows.
*     -  Bad values remain bad in the returned array.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Loop until a suitable random number (in range 0-1) is found).
*     Get two uncorrelated random numbers from the seed.  Get another
*     from these that lies in the range 0--1.  If it lies in the range
*     add it to input value.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Has to overcome the bug that odd and even random numbers
*     generated are correlated when using the Vax-specific RAN (called
*     by SLA_RANDOM).
