*  Name:
*     LPG_COM 

*  Purpose:
*     Define the common blocks used by the LPG library.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global variables include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains declarations of global variables used internally 
*     by the LPG library for accessing groups of data files (NDFs or 
*     catalogues). 

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The DAT_PAR and LPG_CONST include file should be included prior to 
*     this file, in order to define constants which are needed here.

*  Authors:
*     DSB: David S. Berry (STARLINK)

*  History:

*        Original version.

*-

*  The names of the data file parameters (NDFs and catalogues) used by the 
*  application.
      CHARACTER PNAME( LPG__MXPAR )*( DAT__SZNAM ) 

*  The names of other parameters used by the application.
      CHARACTER PNAME2( LPG__MXPAR )*( DAT__SZNAM ) 

*  The identifier for the GRP groups holding the names supplied for 
*  each data file parameter.
      INTEGER IGRP( LPG__MXPAR ) 

*  The number of data files supplied for each data file parameter.
      INTEGER SIZE( LPG__MXPAR ) 

*  The number of data file parameters used by the application.
      INTEGER NPAR

*  The number of other parameters used by the application.
      INTEGER NPAR2

*  The number of times the application has been invoked so far.
      INTEGER NRUN               

*  A flag for each data file parameter indicating if the parameter is
*  used to access existing (i.e. old) data files. If not, the parameter
*  is used to access new data files to be created by the application.
      LOGICAL OLD( LPG__MXPAR )

*  A flag for each data file parameter indicating if the parameter value 
*  has been reported.
      LOGICAL REP( LPG__MXPAR )

*  The original (i.e. before the first invocation was performed) PAR state 
*  of each parameter listed in array PNAME2.
      INTEGER STATE2( LPG__MXPAR )

*  A flag indicating if the values used for each data file parameter 
*  should be displayed each time the parameter is accessed.
      LOGICAL VERB

*  A flag indicating if looping is currently disabled.
      LOGICAL DISAB

*  A delay (in seconds) to place between invocations.
      REAL DELAY

*  Declare the common blocks, one for numeric/boolean data, and one for
*  character data.
      COMMON /LPG_COM1/ NPAR, NRUN, IGRP, SIZE, OLD, VERB, REP, STATE2,
     :                  NPAR2, DELAY, DISAB
      COMMON /LPG_COM2/ PNAME, PNAME2

*  Ensure the contents of the common blocks are retained throughout the
*  life of the applicaton.
      SAVE /LPG_COM1/
      SAVE /LPG_COM2/
