     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CTG1_EXPAN

*  Purpose:
*     Expands a wild card template.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CTG1_EXPAN( VERB, TEMPLT, IGRP, NFMT, FMT, FOUND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied wild-card template is expanded into a list of file 
*     names, which are appended to the supplied group. If the supplied 
*     template matches files with the same directory/basename but with 
*     different file types, then only the file with the highest priority 
*     file type is returned (i.e. the file type which is closest to 
*     the start of CAT_FORMATS_IN).

*  Arguments:
*     VERB = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If TRUE then errors which occur whilst accessing supplied catalogues 
*        are flushed so that the user can see them before re-prompting for
*        a new catalogue ("verbose" mode). Otherwise, they are annulled and 
*        a general "Cannot access file xyz" message is displayed before 
*        re-prompting.
*     TEMPLT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The wild card template.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group to which the expanded names should
*        be appended. On exit, this group is at the end of a chain of 
*        groups connected by a GRP "owner-slave" relationship. The other
*        groups is the chain hold individual fields  from the full catalogue
*        specification. The full chain (starting from the head) is as
*        follows:
*
*                 1) FITS extension specification
*                 2) File types
*                 3) Base file names
*                 4) Directory paths
*                 5) Full catalogue specification (this is the returned group - IGRP)
*
*        The other groups in the chain are deleted automatically by GRP
*        when the returned group (IGRP) is deleted.
*     NFMT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of catalogue file types stored in FMT. May be zero.
*     FMT( NFMT ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An array of known catalogue file types. 
*     FOUND = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Returned .TRUE. if one or more files were found matching the
*        supplied template. Returned .FALSE. otherwise.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
