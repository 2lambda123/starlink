      SUBROUTINE CTG_ASSO1( PARAM, VERB, MODE, CI, FIELDS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CTG_ASSO1

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain an identifier for a single existing catalogue using a 
*     specified parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CTG_ASSO1( PARAM, VERB, MODE, CI, FIELDS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine is equivalent to CAT_ASSOC except that it allows the 
*     catalogue to be specified using a GRP group expression (for instance,
*     its name may be given within a text file, etc). The first catalogue in 
*     the group expression is returned. Any other names in the group
*     expression are ignored. Supplemental information describing the 
*     separate fields in the catalogue specification are also returned.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Name of the ADAM parameter.
*     VERB = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If TRUE then errors which occur whilst accessing supplied catalogues 
*        are flushed so that the user can see them before re-prompting for
*        a new catalogue ("verbose" mode). Otherwise, they are annulled and 
*        a general "Cannot access file xyz" message is displayed before 
*        re-prompting.
*     MODE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Type of catalogue access required: 'READ', 'UPDATE' or 'WRITE'.
*     CI = INTEGER (Returned)
*        catalogue identifier.
*     FIELDS( 5 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Each element contains the following on exit:
*
*           1 - FITS extension specification (eg "{3}") if any
*           2 - File type
*           3 - Base file name
*           4 - Directory path
*           5 - Full catalogue specification 
*
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
