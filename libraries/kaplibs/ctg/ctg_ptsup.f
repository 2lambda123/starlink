      SUBROUTINE CTG_PTSUP( IGRP, I, FIELDS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CTG_PTSUP

*  Purpose:
*     Store suplemental information for an catalogue.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CTG_PTSUP( IGRP, I, FIELDS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Stores the supplied items of supplemental information for a given 
*     entry in a CTG group. The GRP groups needed to store this
*     supplemental information are created if they do not already exist,
*     and associated with the supplied group by means of a chain of GRP
*     "owner-slave" relationships. They will be deleted automaticaly when
*     the supplied group is deleted using GRP_DELET.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The CTG group as returned by CTG_ASSOC, etc. This should be the last 
*        group in a GRP owner-slave chain.
*     I = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the required entry.
*     FIELDS( 5 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The supplemental information to be stored with the entry specified
*        by I. Each element of the supplied array should contain the 
*        following:
*           1 - FITS extension (eg "{3}") if any
*           2 - File type
*           3 - Base file name
*           4 - Directory path
*           5 - Full catalogue specification 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
