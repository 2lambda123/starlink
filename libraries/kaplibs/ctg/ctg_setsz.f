      SUBROUTINE CTG_SETSZ( IGRP, SIZE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CTG_SETSZ

*  Purpose:
*     Reduces the size of a CTG group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CTG_SETSZ( IGRP, SIZE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine should be used instead of GRP_SETSZ to set the size of
*     a group created by CTG. It sets the size of the supplied group, and
*     also sets the size of each of the supplemental groups associated with
*     the supplied group.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The CTG group as returned by CTG_ASSOC, etc. This should be the last 
*        group in a GRP owner-slave chain.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The new group size. Must be less than or equal to the size of the
*        smallest group in the chain.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

      IGRP1 = IGRP
      DO WHILE( IGRP1 .NE. GRP__NOID ) 

*  Set the size of this group.
        CALL GRP_SETSZ( IGRP1, SIZE, STATUS )

*  Find the owner of this group. GRP__NOID is returned if the group
*  has no owner.
        CALL GRP_OWN( IGRP1, IGRP2, STATUS )
