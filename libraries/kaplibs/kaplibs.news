KAPLIBS is a package containing several Fortran subroutine libraries 
which provide general purpose algorithms required by the KAPPA package,
and which may be of use to anyone developing their own KAPPA-like 
applications (see SUN/238).

Version 2.8

   - Can now be built as a shared library
   - Added kpg1_astcmn to provide access to KPG_AST private common block
   - The link script now accepts a -notk option so that no Tk dependencies
     will be included in the link
   - The HLP helper routines are no longer part of kaplibs. Use SHL
     library instead.
   - kpg1_trmsz no longer present. Please use one_trmsz instead.

Version 2.7. includes the following changes:

   - New routine LPG_REPLA controls a new option which allows a single NDF
   to be used as both input and output for an adam task. The default is
   for this option to be disabled.
