\section {Introduction}

KAPPA is package of general purpose astronomical image processing and
visualization commands. It is documented in \xref{SUN/95}{sun95}{}. Over
the long history of the KAPPA package, many internal Fortran subroutines
have been written to provide facilities within KAPPA which have
subsequently proved to be of more general use outside KAPPA. In order to
gain the benefit of these internal KAPPA facilities, software developers
have in the past taken copies of the relevant routines and included them
in their own projects. The disadvantages of this are obvious - it is easy
to end up with many, potentially different, copies of the same routines
within a large software suite such as the Starlink Software Collection,
and bug fixes need to be implemented in many different places, rather
than a in single master copy.

Another way of using the internal KAPPA routines is to link your
applications directly against the libraries in the KAPPA package, but
this requires the KAPPA package to be installed anywhere where your
software is to be built, which is not always convenient.

To get round these problems, the KAPLIBS package was created to
contain the internal routines from KAPPA which are deemed to be
``generally useful''. Now, you only need to have KAPLIBS installed to
build your software, not the much larger KAPPA.

There are a large number of routines in KAPLIBS, making it potentially
difficult to find the routines you want. To ease this problem, a search
tool is provided which allows the contents of this document to be
searched (see \hyperref{here}{section }{}{SEC:SEARCH}).

\subsection{Stability of the KAPLIBS Interface}
KAPLIBS was created as a pragmatic solution to the problem of
proliferation of KAPPA source code in several other packages. One of the
reasons for previously keeping these routines hidden away within KAPPA was
so that changes could be made to the argument lists or functionality
of these routines without breaking software within other packages. In
practice, it has hardly ever been necessary to change the interface to
routines after an initial development period, but the possibility still
exists that this may be necessary. For this reason, users of KAPLIBS
should be aware that \emph{it may occasionally be necessary to change the
interface to KAPLIBS routines}. Such changes will be listed within
this document at each release. To aid developers decisions over which
routines to use, routines which are deemed to have a significant chance
of being changed within the foreseeable future are highlighted later in
this document. This class of routine will normally just include routines
which have only recently been written.

\subsection{The Scope of this Document}
The purpose of this document is to give reference information about the
argument lists and functionality of the internal KAPPA routines which are
contained within KAPLIBS. It does not give a detailed explanation of how
these routines should be used within a real application. Developers
should usually study examples of existing code within KAPPA for this
purpose. The source code for KAPPA is available from the Starlink
Software Librarian, {\tt ussc@star.rl.ac.uk}.

Applications within KAPPA are split up into several groups (called
``monoliths'), with names such as {\tt kapview}, {\tt ndfpack} and
(rather confusingly) {\tt kappa}. The top-level routines for the
applications in monolith {\tt xyz} are in the tar file {\tt
\$KAPPA\_DIR/xyz\_sub.tar}. Each application may use some
application-specific subroutines (\emph{i.e.} subroutines which are so
closely related to the purpose of a single application that they are not
deemed as ``generally useful''). These will be denoted by subroutines
names with prefix ``{\tt KPS1\_}'' and will be contained within the tar
file {\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/kapsub\_sub.tar}.

\section{Naming Conventions}
Each subroutine within KAPLIBS has a name of the form {\tt <prefix>\_<name>}
where {\tt <prefix>} is a prefix indicating which KAPPA library the
routine belongs to, and {\tt <name>} is a unique name for the routine.
The prefix associated with each KAPPA library indicates something of the
purpose of that library. The following prefixes are currently included
within KAPLIBS:

\begin{description}

\item [CTG\_] These are routines for accessing groups of catalogues through
a single parameter using wild-cards, \emph{etc.}. This is analogous to
the way the NDG library (see \xref{SUN/95}{sun95}{}) accesses groups
of NDFs using a single parameter.

\item [LPG\_] These are routines which are used to implement looping
within a monolith in order to allow a command to be repeatedly invoked
until all supplied data files (catalogues or NDFs) have been processed.
See the KAPPA monolith routines such as {\tt kapview\_mon.f}, {\tt
ndfpack\_mon.f} and {\tt kappa\_mon.f}. LPG routines should be used instead
of NDF or CAT routines to access NDFs or catalogues within applications
if this looping behaviour is required.

\item [AIF\_] These are old routines which were used to access parameter
values or temporary work space. They are gradually being replaced within
KAPPA by more modern routines provided by the PAR and PSX libraries.

\item [FTS1\_] These are routines used to access FITS files and headers -
KAPPA's own {\tt fitsio}.

\item [IRA\_] These routines were initially part of the IRAS90 Astrometry
library (hence the IRA acronym). They are used to gain access to WCS
information stored within NDFs in the form of IRAS90 Astrometry extension.
This form of WCS is now deprecated in favour of the NDF WCS component.

\item [IRQ\_] These routines were initially part of the IRAS90 Astrometry
library (hence the IRQ acronym). They are used to manage and use textual
names representing bits in the NDF Quality component. Further information
about IRQ is available in the document id6.tex which is part of the
KAPLIBS source distribution.

\item [KPG1\_] These are other general purpose routines which do not fall
into such obvious groups.  Even within this library, though, there are
loose associations of routines, usually indicated by some common element
within the routine name. The following are some of the more significant
associations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Routines associated with use of the PGPLOT graphics package usually
have names which start ``{\tt KPG1\_PG}''.
\item Routines associated with use of the AGI graphics database usually
have names which start ``{\tt KPG1\_GD}''.
\item Routines associated with accessing or using WCS information usually
have names which start ``{\tt KPG1\_AS}''.
\end{itemize}

\end{description}

Within all these groups, some routines have different versions for
processing data with different numerical types. The names of such
routines are identical except for the trailing one or two characters
which indicate the numerical type processed. These one or two character
codes are:

\begin{description}
\item [d] - Double precision floating point
\item [r] - Single precision floating point
\item [c] - Character
\item [i] - Single precision integer
\item [w] - Word (usually 2 bytes integers)
\item [uw] - Unsigned word (usually 2 bytes unsigned integers)
\item [bw] - Byte (usually 1 byte integers)
\item [ub] - Unsigned byte (usually 1 byte unsigned integers)
\item [l] - Logical
\end{description}

Sometimes, routine names are documented as ending with a lower case
``x''. This indicates that routines exist for various of the above
numerical types. The \emph{actual} routines names will not include the trailing
``x'', but will have one of the above codes in place of the ``x''.

\section{Compiling and Linking}
To compile and link an application with the KAPLIBS package, the following
commands should be used (see \xref{SUN/144}{sun144}{}):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
      % kaplibs_dev
      % alink adamprog.f `kaplibs_link_adam`
      % kaplibs_dev remove
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Note the use of {\em opening} apostrophes (`) rather than the more common
closing apostrophe (')\footnote{Currently, the parameter handling
routines within KAPLIBS have not been separated out, and so it is not
currently possible to link stand-alone (\emph{i.e.} ``non-Adam'')
applications against KAPLIBS.}.

This produces an executable image called {\bf prog}. The
\verb+kaplibs_dev+ command creates soft links within the current
directory to the various include files provided by KAPLIBS. These are
removed by the \verb+kaplibs_dev remove+ command.

\subsection{Linking with Native PGPLOT}
The commands described above will link the application with the Starlink
GKS version of the \xref{PGPLOT graphics library}{sun15}{}. If you wish 
to link with the {\em native} version of PGPLOT, then include the switch
``-nogks'' as follows:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
      % alink adamprog.f `kaplibs_link_adam -nogks`
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This will include native PGPLOT in the link list, and cause all GKS and IDI
related items to be removed.

\section{Changes in Version 3.0}
\begin{itemize}
\item \xref{CTG}{sun262}{}, \xref{IRQ}{sun261}{}, and \xref{LPG}{sun263}{} 
      libraries are no longer in KAPLIBS.  They are autonomous
      libraries each with its own documentation and link scripts.
\item KPG1\_MVBDx added. It modifies an array index (such as produced by
      \xref{PDA\_QSIAx}{sun194}{PDA_QSIAx}) to exclude indices that refer 
      to bad data values.
\item KPG\_STOSx added.  It calculates accurate order statistics by
      sorting an array by means of an index, returning the median and
      optionally percentiles.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.8}
\begin{itemize}

\item KPG1\_BADBX added. It returns an NDF identifier for the smallest section 
      of a supplied NDF that encloses all the good data values in the NDF.
\item KPG1\_BBOX$<$T$>$ added. It obtains the pixel bounding box of a given 
     value within an $N$-dimensional data array.
\item KPG1\_LIKE added. It obtains a section of an NDF that matches either
      the pixel or WCS shape of a given template NDF.
\item KPG1\_KYMAP can read vectors as well as scalars from a GRP
      group into an AST keyMap.
\item {\tt kaplibs\_link} script now works without attempting to load ADAM
      symbols.
\item Can now be built as a shared library.
\item Added KPG1\_ASTCMN to provide access to KPG\_AST private common block
\item The \xref{HLP}{sun124}{} helper routines are no longer part of kaplibs.
      Use the SHL library instead.
\item KPG1\_SCRSZ is no longer present. Please use
      \xref{ONE\_SCRSZ}{sun234}{ONE\_SCRSZ} instead.
\item Now released under the GPL.
\item kpgGtfts and kpgPtfts can now be used to read and write
      AST FitsChan objects from/to an NDF.
\item KAPLIBS no longer links against Tk (the one Tk routine has been
      removed from KAPLIBS).
\item KAPLIBS now has a public C interface (but not for all routines).
\item Added KPG1\_CGET, which returns the value of an NDF character
      component removing any AST or PGPLOT escape sequences.
\item Added KPG1\_MXMNX, which provides a single interface to the
      existing generic KPG1\_MXMNx routines.
\item Added KPG1\_SCALX, which provides a single interface to the
      new doubly generic KPG1\_SCLxx routines, for scaling
      and shifting data values.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.7}
\begin{itemize}
\item A new routine LPG\_REPLA has been added. It controls a new option
      which allows a single NDF to be used as both input and output for an 
      ADAM task.  The default is for this option to be disabled.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.6}
\begin{itemize}
\item The GRF module (grf\_kaplibs.c) has been upgraded to include the
      extra functions needed by AST V3.2.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.5}
\begin{itemize}
\item The KPG1\_FFT... routines have been made significantly faster (at
      the expense of using slightly more memory). For instance, a speed gain
      of a factor 10 is typical for an array of 150000 points.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.4}
\begin{itemize}
\item The KPG1\_WRLST routine now normalises the supplied positions (using
      \xref{AST\_NORM}{sun210}{AST_NORM}) before writing them to the output
      catalogue.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.3}
\begin{itemize}
\item The routine GETHLP has been moved from KAPPA to the KAPLIBS:KAPGEN library.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Script \verb+kaplibs_link+ has been added to enable linking of standalone
      applications.
\item The routine KPG1\_DSFRM has been modified to include details of AST
      SpecFrames. \emph{The argument list has also been changed.}
\item The routine KPG1\_ASMRG has been modified to attempt alignment in
      Domain SPECTRAL.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.1}
\begin{itemize}
\item The KPG1\_CPSTY routine has been added to copy AST Plotting styles
      from one graphical element to another.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in Version 2.0}
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``-nogks'' switch has been added to the
      \verb#kaplibs_link_adam# command, allowing applications to be linked with
      native PGPLOT instead of the Starlink GKS-based PGPLOT.
\item The routine KPG1\_WRLST now allows the user to choose the
      co-ordinate system in which the positions are stored in the catalogue
      columns. This is done using two ADAM parameters called COLFRAME and
      COLEPOCH (these names are hard-wired into the routine to encourage
      conformity). Consequently, applications which use this routine should add
      definitions for these two parameters to their IFL files.
\item The routine KPG1\_RDLST can now read positions from catalogues which
      do not contain a WCS FrameSet, in certain special cases. That is, if the
      catalogue contains columsn called RA and DEC, or X and Y.
\item The IRAS90 IRQ library has been included. IRQ is used to manage
      textual representations of NDF Quality bits.
\end{itemize}
