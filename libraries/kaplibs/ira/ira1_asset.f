      SUBROUTINE IRA1_ASSET( LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA1_ASSET

*  Purpose:
*     Set an astrometry structure to the DEFINED state.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA1_ASSET( LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The STATE component of the astrometry structure (AS) is given the
*     value "DEFINED". This will cause other IRA routines to accept
*     the values stored for the other AS components.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Locator to the astrometry structure.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
