      SUBROUTINE IRA_IPROJ( LIST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA_IPROJ

*  Purpose:
*     Return a list of supported projection names.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA_IPROJ( LIST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A string is returned containing the list of supported projection
*     names and equivalent names. The names are separated by commas. The
*     currently supported projections are:
*
*     GNOMONIC ( or equivalently TANGENT_PLANE )
*
*     LAMBERT (  or equivalently CYLINDRICAL )
*
*     AITOFF (  or equivalently ALL_SKY )
*
*     ORTHOGRAPHIC
*
*     See ID/2 appendix "Projection Equations" for more details about
*     the supported projections.

*  Arguments:
*     LIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The list of supported projections and equivalent names. The
*        character variable supplied for this argument should have a
*        declared size equal to the value of parameter IRA__SZPLS. If
*        the supplied string is not long enough to hold all the names, a
*        warning message is given, but no error status is returned. Each
*        returned projection name has a maximum length given by symbolic
*        constant IRA__SZPRJ.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
