      SUBROUTINE IRA_WRITE( IDA, LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA_WRITE

*  Purpose:
*     Write astrometry information into an HDS object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA_WRITE( IDA, LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The astrometry information identified by IDA is stored within the
*     object located by argument LOC. The constant IRA__HDSTY gives the
*     HDS type required for the object. The object must have this type
*     and be empty.

*  Arguments:
*     IDA = INTEGER (Given)
*        An IRA identifier for the astrometry information.
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A locator to the object to which the astrometry information is
*        to be written.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
