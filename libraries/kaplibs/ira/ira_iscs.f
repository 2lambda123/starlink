      SUBROUTINE IRA_ISCS( LIST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA_ISCS

*  Purpose:
*     Return a list of supported sky coordinate systems.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA_ISCS( LIST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A string is returned containing a list of names identifying the
*     supported sky coordinate systems. The names in the output list
*     are separated by commas.
*
*     By default, Equatorial and Ecliptic coordinates are referred to
*     the mean equinox of Besselian epoch 1950.0. The calling
*     application can override this default by appending a string known
*     as an "equinox specifier" to the end of the SCS name (in fact all
*     IRA routines will accept any unambiguous abbreviation of the SCS
*     name). An equinox specifier consists of a year with upto 4
*     decimal places, preceded with the letter B or J to indicate a
*     Besselian or Julian epoch, and enclosed in parentheses. The
*     named coordinate system is then referred to the mean equinox of
*     the epoch given in the equinox specifier. The following are
*     examples of legal SCS values; EQUATORIAL(B1950), EQUAT(J2000),
*     ECLIP, ECLIP(1983.2534), etc. If the date is not preceded with
*     either B or J (as in the last example), a Besselian epoch is
*     assumed if the date is less than 1984.0, and a Julian epoch is
*     assumed otherwise.
*
*     The currently supported sky coordinate systems are:
*
*     EQUATORIAL
*
*            The longitude axis is Right Ascension, the latitude axis
*            is Declination. Other legal names can be made by appending
*            an equinox specifier (eg EQUATORIAL(B1983.5) ). If no
*            equinox specifier is added, the coordinates are referred
*            to the mean equinox of Besselian epoch 1950.0. If the
*            equinox is described by a Besselian epoch, the old FK4
*            Bessel-Newcomb system is used. If a Julian epoch is used,
*            the new IAU 1976, FK5, Fricke system is used.
*
*     GALACTIC
*
*            The longitude axis is galactic longitude and the latitude
*            axis is galactic latitude, given in the IAU 1958 galactic
*            coordinate system.
*
*     ECLIPTIC
*
*            The longitude axis is ecliptic longitude and the latitude
*            axis is ecliptic latitude. Other legal names can be made
*            by appending an equinox specifier (eg ECLIPTIC(B1983.5) ).
*            If no equinox specifier is added, the coordinates are
*            referred to the mean equinox of Besselian epoch 1950.0.
*
*     AZEL
*
*            The longitude axis is horizon azimuth and the latitude axis is
*            horizon elevation.
*
*     All sky coordinate values supplied to, or returned from any IRA
*     routine, are given in units of radians.

*  Arguments:
*     LIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The list of supported sky coordinate system names. The
*        character variable supplied for this argument should have a
*        declared size equal to the value of parameter IRA__SZCLS. If
*        the supplied string is not long enough to hold all the names, a
*        warning message is given, but no error status is returned.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
