      SUBROUTINE IRA_GTSCS( SCSPAR, DEFLT, SCS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA_GTSCS

*  Purpose:
*     Get the full name of a Sky Coordinate System (with equinox
*     specifier) from the environment.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA_GTSCS( SCSPAR, DEFLT, SCS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The ADAM parameter specified by argument SCSPAR is used to get a
*     character string from the environment. A check is done to make
*     sure that the string obtained represents a supported Sky
*     Coordinate System (SCS). The user may include an equinox
*     specifier (see IRA_ISCS) in the text string to override the
*     default reference equinox of B1950. If an illegal SCS name is
*     entered the user is reprompted. If DEFLT is given true, the value
*     of SCS on entry is used as a default for the parameter.  The
*     value of SCS is expanded (both on entry and exit) to a full SCS
*     name (an abbreviation of the SCS may be supplied either by the
*     calling routine or by the user instead of the full name).

*  Arguments:
*     SCSPAR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter to use, which should be of type
*        LITERAL.
*     DEFLT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then the value of argument SCS on entry is used (after
*        expansion) as the run-time default for the parameter.
*     SCS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        On entry, specifies the default value for the parameter. On
*        exit, contains the full version of the sky coordinate system
*        entered by the user. The supplied variable should have a
*        declared length given by symbolic constant IRA__SZSCS.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
