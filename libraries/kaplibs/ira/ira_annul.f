      SUBROUTINE IRA_ANNUL( IDA, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA_ANNUL

*  Purpose:
*     Annul an IRA identifier.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA_ANNUL( IDA, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine should be called when access to the astrometry
*     information associated with an IRA identifier is no longer
*     needed. It releases the resources used to store the astrometry
*     information.
*
*     This routine attempts to execute even if STATUS is bad on entry.
*     However, in this case no error report will be produced if this
*     routine subsequently fails.

*  Arguments:
*     IDA = INTEGER ( Given )
*        The IRA identifier to be annulled.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*        ACM_VALID( IRA__MAX ) = LOGICAL (Write)
*           If true, then the associated elements of the other arrays
*           held in common contain valid astrometry information.

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER IDA

*  Status:
      INTEGER STATUS             ! Global status

*.

*  Start a new error reporting environment.
      CALL ERR_BEGIN( STATUS )

*  Check the supplied identifier is valid.
      CALL IRA1_CHECK( IDA, STATUS )

*  If it is, set the IRA identifier invalid.
      IF( STATUS .EQ. SAI__OK ) ACM_VALID( IDA ) = .FALSE.

*  If an error has been reported, give a context message.
      IF( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) THEN
         CALL ERR_REP( 'IRA_ANNUL_ERR1',
     :          'IRA_ANNUL: Unable to annul an IRA identifier', STATUS )
      END IF

*  End the error reporting environment.
      CALL ERR_END( STATUS )
