      SUBROUTINE IRA_GTCO1( PARAM, PROMPT, SCS, NC, DEFLT, VALUE,
     :                      STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA_GTCO1

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain a single sky coordinate value from the ADAM environment.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA_GTCO1( PARAM, PROMPT, SCS, NC, DEFLT, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The ADAM parameter specified by argument PARAM is used to acquire
*     a longitude or latitude value in the requested sky coordinate
*     system. Argument NC determines which is to be obtained.  The
*     string is decoded into a double precision number representing the
*     sky position.  See the documentation for IRA_CTOR for a
*     description of the allowed formats.  The input sky coordinate
*     value can optionally be communicated to the environment as a
*     dynamic default.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter used to get the sky
*        coordinate value.
*     PROMPT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A string to override the current prompt for the parameter.
*        If this is blank, the prompt is left at its current value.
*        The initial value for the prompt is defined in the interface
*        file. Note, unlike routine IRA_GETCO, the axis name is not
*        automatically included in the prompt.
*     SCS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The sky coordinate system in use. Any unambiguous abbreviation
*        will do  (see ID2 section "Sky Coordinates").
*     NC = INTEGER (Given)
*        Determines which sky coordinate is to be returned. If a value
*        of 1 is supplied, the string obtained for the parameter is
*        interpreted as a longitude value (eg RA if an equatorial
*        system is being used). If a value of 2 is supplied, the string
*        is interpreted as a latitude value.  Any other value causes an
*        error to be reported.
*     DEFLT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then the value of VALUE on entry is communicated to
*        the environment as a dynamic default. If false, or if VALUE is
*        "BAD" on entry (i.e. equal to VAL__BADD), then no dynamic
*        default is set up.
*     VALUE = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        The sky coordinate value. On input it contains the default
*        value (in radians) to use if DEFLT is true. On exit it
*        contains the decoded value obtained from the environment, in
*        radians.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
