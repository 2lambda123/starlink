      SUBROUTINE IRA1_DECOD( IN, OUT, BADFLD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA1_DECOD

*  Purpose:
*     Decode an "encoded" coordinate value.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA1_DECOD( IN, OUT, BADFLD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The input value represents a time value in the form
*     ..hhhhmmss.ss.., or an angular value in the form ..ddddmmss.ss..
*     The hours (h) or degrees (d) fields can have any number of
*     digits, as can the fractional part of the seconds (s) field. The
*     output value is a normal DOUBLE PRECISION value in units of hours
*     or degrees. The absolute value of the input is used, but if the
*     input is negative, then the output is negated before being
*     returned.

*  Arguments:
*     IN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The input "encoded" value.
*     OUT = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The output value in units of hours or degrees.
*     BADFLD = REAL (Returned)
*        If either the minutes or seconds field has a value greater
*        than 60, STATUS is returned equal to IRA__RANGE, and the
*        illegal field value is returned in BADFLD. NOTE, no error
*        is reported in this situation (an exception to standard
*        Starlink policy!).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Status:

*  Local Variables:

*  Check inherited global status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  Divide by 10000.0. The integer part is the hours or degrees
*  field.
      INTPT = INT( ABS(IN)/10000.0D0 )
      REMPT = ABS(IN) - INTPT*10000.0D0
      OUT = INTPT

*  Divide the remainder by 100.0. The integer part of the result
*  is the minutes field.

      INTPT = INT( REMPT/100.0D0 )
      REMPT = REMPT - INTPT*100.0D0
      OUT = OUT + INTPT/60.0D0

*  Check that the minutes field is less than 60.
      IF( INTPT .GE. 60 ) THEN
         STATUS = IRA__RANGE
         BADFLD = REAL( INTPT )
         GO TO 999
      END IF

*  The remainder is the seconds field.
      OUT = OUT + REMPT/3600.0D0

*  Check that the seconds field is less than 60.
      IF( REMPT .GE. 60 ) THEN
         STATUS = IRA__RANGE
         BADFLD = REAL( REMPT )
         GO TO 999

*  Transfer the sign from the input value.
      OUT = SIGN( OUT, IN )
