      SUBROUTINE IRA1_ASDEF( LOC, DEF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA1_ASDEF

*  Purpose:
*     See if an astrometry structure is in the DEFINED state.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA1_ASDEF( LOC, DEF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     If the STATE component of the astrometry structure (AS)
*     exists and has the value other DEFINED, then DEF is returned
*     .true. Otherwise, DEF is returned .false.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Locator to the astrometry structure.
*     DEF = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Returned true if the AS is in the DEFINED state.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
