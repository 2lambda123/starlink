      SUBROUTINE IRA1_CHECK( IDA, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA1_CHECK

*  Purpose:
*     CHeck that the identifier is OK and that IRA has been initialised.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA1_CHECK( IDA, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A check is made that IRA has been initialised. If not an error is
*     reported, otherwise a check is made that the supplied IRA
*     identifier is valid. An error is report if it is not.

*  Arguments:
*     IDA = INTEGER (Given)
*        The IRA identifier to be checked.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
