      SUBROUTINE IRA1_ASNDF( INDF, LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA1_ASNDF

*  Purpose:
*     Create an empty astrometry structure within an NDF extension.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA1_ASNDF( INDF, LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns an HDS locator to an empty astrometry
*     structure (AS) stored in a given NDF. The AS is stored in an NDF
*     extension (identified by global variable ACM_XNAME) which must
*     already exist. An error is returned if the extension does not
*     exist. The name of the AS itself is held in global variable
*     ACM_ASNAME. Both extension name and AS name can be set up by
*     calling IRA_LOCAT. The default values (set up by IRA_INIT) are
*     an extension name of "IRAS", and an AS name of "ASTROMETRY".
*
*     If the NDF already contains an astrometry structure (at any
*     location) it is deleted before creating the new one.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        An HDS locator to the astrometry structure.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
