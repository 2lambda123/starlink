*  Name:
*     FTS1_SCTAB

*  Purpose:
*     Create an ASCII catalogue and description file in SCAR format
*     from a FITS tape or disk file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_SCTAB( HEADER, PNDSCF, PNTAB, MEDIUM, MD, NCARD, SCARD,
*    :                 NDIM, DIMS, LOGHDR, FD, CFN, SUBFIL, PREFIX,
*    :                 AUTO, BLKSIZ, ACTSIZ, BFPNTR, OFFSET, CURREC,
*    :                 RCPNTR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This is a server routine for FITSIN/FITSDIN.  It packages up the
*     operations required to handle a FITS ASCII table file and turn it
*     into an ASCII catalogue and SCAR description file.  The names of
*     the output files are recorded in the logfile.

*  Arguments:
*     HEADER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * 80 (Given)
*        The FITS headers in 80-character records.
*     PNDSCF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter by which the filename of the SCAR
*        description file will be obtained.
*     PNTAB = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter by which the filename of the
*        table will be obtained.
*     MEDIUM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The medium containing the FITS file.  Currently supported are
*        'DISK' for a disk file, and 'TAPE' for standard magnetic tape.
*     MD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The tape or file descriptor depending on the value of %MEDIUM.
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of card images in the buffer.
*     SCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from where the searches of the header
*        will begin.  This is needed because the headers make contain a
*        dummy header prior to an extension.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimensionality of the table.  At present only 2-d is supported.
*     DIMS( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensions of the table.
*     LOGHDR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true there is a log file open and records of the output file
*        names will be written to it.
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The file descriptor for the log file.  It is ignored if %LOGHDR
*        is false.
*     CFN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The number on the tape of the FITS file being processed if
*        MEDIUM is 'TAPE', or the input disk-FITS filename if MEDIUM
*        is 'TAPE'.
*     SUBFIL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the sub-file/extension within the current FITS
*        file being processed.
*     PREFIX = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The prefix to be given to the file name of catalogues produced
*        in automatic mode. It is ignored when %MEDIUM = 'DISK'.
*     AUTO = LOGICAL (Given)
*         If true the processing should be done in automatic mode, where
*         the user is not prompted for file names, since these are
*         generated from the prefix, file and sub-file numbers in the
*         case where the medium is tape.  The form is prefix_file or
*         prefix_file_subfile if the subfile is greater than 1.
*         %MEDIUM = 'DISK' the prefix is ignored.
*     BLKSIZ = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The maximum block size and dimension of %BUFFER.
*     ACTSIZ = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The actual block size on tape or disk (a multiple of the FITS
*        record length of 2880 bytes). It is only an input argument for
*        %MEDIUM = 'DISK'.
*     BFPNTR = INTEGER (Given) 
*        Pointer to the buffer containing catalogue data, the buffer
*        itself will be updated each time a tape block is read.  
*        If the offset equals the block size then the existing data 
*        in the buffer will not be used.
*     OFFSET = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of bytes in the current block already interpreted
*        as the header plus any earlier FITS files.
*     CURREC = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        If true the current FITS record is to be used immediately, i.e.
*        it has alrady been read from tape or disk into %RECORD.
*     RCPNTR = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to the buffer to hold the current FITS record of 36
*        80-character card images.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The magnetic tape or disk file must already be associated, and
*     any log file must be opened.

*    ===========================================

*    The FITS data must start in a new record.  Now this record may

*    be procesed from its start, hence a zero displacement.  The flag
*    can be switched off as this positioning information is imparted
*    to the record displacement.  If the current record is not the
*    first FITS record containing the data, set the the displacement
*    to the end of the FITS record.  This will cause a new record be
*    read.  For simple FITS the displacement will be either 0 or 2880.
*    This is only needed in thisd routine to permit tables to be
*    skipped.
