      SUBROUTINE FTS1_SCOFB ( BSCALE, BZERO, UNDEF, BLANK, SIZE, ARRAY,
     :                        STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_SCOFB

*  Purpose:
*     Applies scale and zero to a REAL data vector, and substitutes
*     magic values for blank FITS data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_SCOFB ( BSCALE, BZERO, UNDEF, BLANK, SIZE, ARRAY,
*    :                  STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine applies scale and offset to a 1-d REAL array.  Any
*     pixels with the %BLANK value are substituted by the standard
*     magic value. On output, pixel is input value times scale plus
*     offset.

*  Arguments:
*     BSCALE = REAL (Given)
*        Scale factor to be applied to the array.
*     BZERO = REAL (Given)
*        Offset to be applied to the array.
*     UNDEF = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, testing and replacement of undefined data values is
*        to occur.  A blank value, as specified by %BLANK, is replaced
*        by the standard magic value.  If false, the value of %BLANK
*        is ignored.
*     BLANK = INTEGER (Given)
*        Value of an undefined datum.
*     SIZE  = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of elements in the data array.
*     ARRAY( SIZE ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The data array to which scaling and offset is to be applied.
*     STATUS  = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     If replacement of blank pixels required then
*        For all pixels
*           If pixel is undefined then
*              Set pixel to magic value
*           Else
*              Compute output pixel value
*           Endif
*        Endfor
*     Else
*        For all pixels
*           Compute output pixel value
*        Endfor
*     Endif
*     End

*          Since values have been converted from integers, NINT will not

*          the standard bad value, otherwise apply the scale and offset.
