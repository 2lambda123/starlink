*  Name:
*     FTS1_RDATA

*  Purpose:
*     Read the data of a FITS file on disk or tape.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_RDATA ( MEDIUM, MD, SIZE, BPV, REVERS, BLKSIZ, ACTSIZ,
*    :                  BUFFER, OFFSET, RECORD, RDISP, DARRAY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine reads the byte stream in the data blocks from the
*     FITS tape or disk file written in the simple format, and writes
*     the data into an array.  The bytes may be reversed for VAX/VMS.

*  Arguments:
*     MEDIUM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The medium containing the FITS file.  Currently supported are
*        'DISK' for a disk file, and 'TAPE' for standard magnetic tape.
*     MD     = INTEGER (Given)
*        The tape or file descriptor depending on the value of %MEDIUM.
*     SIZE   = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of elements in the data array.
*     BPV    = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of bytes per data value.
*     REVERS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true the FITS data bytes are to be reversed within each
*        word (when BPV is 2) or each integer (when BPV is 4) etc.  If
*        BPV=1 this flags makes no difference.  Normally, only 2's
*        complement integer data need be reversed.  Floating-point data
*        require adjacent bytes to be swapped.
*     BLKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum blocksize and dimension of the tape/disk buffer.
*     ACTSIZ = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The actual block size (a multiple of the FITS record length of
*        2880 bytes).  It is only an input argument for
*        %MEDIUM = 'DISK'.
*     BUFFER( BLKSIZ ) = BYTE (Given and Returned)
*        The buffer containing the block of data. This is only read
*        when %OFFSET does not equal %ACTSIZ, i.e. there are some
*        non-header data within it.
*     OFFSET = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of bytes in the current block already interpreted.
*     RECORD( 2880 ) = BYTE (Given and Returned)
*        The buffer to hold the current FITS record.
*     RDISP = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of bytes in the current record already interpreted.
*        If this displacement is equal to the record length then a new
*        FITS record will be obtained.  The displacement will be updated
*        during processing of the group parameters and data, and
*        therefore can have an arbitrary value between 0 and 2880.  Do
*        not modify this argument outside this routine once initialised.
*     DARRAY( SIZE * BPV ) = BYTE (Returned)
*        The data array used to store the data read.
*     STATUS  = INTEGER(Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     Compute number of bytes of data to be read
*     Initialise count of data-array bytes read
*     While not end of data
*        If buffer contains only previously processed information
*           Read a data block into the buffer
*           If an error occurred, report context and exit
*           Zero the offset
*        Endif
*        Find number of bytes in current block remaining to be processed
*        Put the parts of the buffer containing data into the data
*          structure
*        Increment byte count
*        Sum offset of data within input buffer
*     End while
*     End

*  History:
*     1987 Jul 21 (PMA):
*        Original version.
*     1988 May    (MJC):
*        Tidied to KAPPA style.
*     1988 Sep 19 (MJC):
*        Converted to blocked FITS tapes and reordered the arguments.
*     1989 Nov 24 (MJC):
*        Change to use OFFSET=ACTSIZ meaning block is exhausted rather
*        than the counter-intuitive 0.
*     1990 November 19 (MJC):
*        Renamed from FITSRD, and converted to the SST prologue style.
*     1990 November 30 (MJC):
*        Added MEDIUM, RDISP and RECORD arguments; and permitted
*        disk-file access; altered to process FITS records rather than
*        blocks (needed for disk access but made consistent by doing the
*        same for tape).
*     1991 Jul 11 (MJC):
*        Added REVERS argument so that IEEE data are not reversed.
*     1992 December (RDS):
*        Added extra argument to FTS1_DREAD calls.
*     2006 April 21 (MJC):
*        Modern-style variable declarations and commenting.
