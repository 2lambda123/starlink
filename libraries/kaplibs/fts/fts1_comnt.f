      SUBROUTINE FTS1_COMNT( NCARD, BUFFER, STCARD, THERE, VALUE, CARD,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_COMNT

*  Purpose:
*     Get the value of a FITS COMMENT card from a buffer of cards.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_COMNT( NCARD, BUFFER, STCARD, THERE, VALUE, CARD,
*    :                 STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine searches a buffer containing the header card images
*     from a FITS file for the next card with keyword COMMENT.  The
*     search begins at a defined card image; and ends when the next end 
*     of a header block, marked by the END keyword, is encountered or
*     the buffer is exhausted.  The routine returns the comment string, 
*     and the number of the card image within the buffer array that
*     contains the comment.  If the keyword is is present %THERE is
*     true, otherwise it is false.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of card images in the buffer.
*     BUFFER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The buffer containing the header card images.
*     STCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from which to search for the next
*        comment card
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true the parameter %NAME is present.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The comment string of the first COMMENT keyword found at or
*        after %STCARD.  The length should be at least 72 characters.
*     CARD = INTEGER(Returned)
*        The number of the card containing the first COMMENT card. If
*        no COMMENT card could be found this is returned with a value of
*        zero.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     Initialise counter and flag
*     For all cards until the last card, or the requested card
*        If card contains the required parameter then
*           Set flag to say parameter has been found
*           Define search limits for trailing quote
*           Extract character string from between the quotes in the
*             buffer
*        Else
*           Increment number of header records
*        Endif
*     Endfor
*     Reset card number to zero if the keyword is not present
*     End
