      SUBROUTINE FTS1_UKEY<T>( NCARD, BUFFER, STCARD, NAME, VALUE,

*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_UKEYx

*  Purpose:
*     Write the value of type <COMM> to the specified keyword from a
*     buffer of FITS-header card images.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_UKEYx( NCARD, BUFFER, STCARD, NAME, VALUE, CMTBGN,
*                      COMNT, THERE, CARD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine searches a buffer containing the header card images
*     from a FITS file for card with keyword %NAME; and, if found,
*     override its original value with the given value %VALUE of type
*     <COMM>.  The keyword can have a comment string leading by the
*     character specified by %CMTBGN.  The search ends when the next
*     end of a header block, marked by the END keyword, is encountered
*     or the buffer is exhausted.  If the keyword is present %THERE is
*     true, otherwise it is false.  If the parameter is present more
*     than once in the header, only the first occurence will be used.
*
*     The name may be compound to permit writing of hierarchical
*     keywords.
*
*     The buffer of FITS header card image should be mapped in the
*     'UPDATE' mode.
*
*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of card images in the buffer.
*     BUFFER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The buffer containing the header card images.
*     STCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from which to start search.
*     NAME = CHARACTER *( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the keyword to be written a new value.  This may be
*        a compound name to handle hierarchical keywords, and it has the
*        form keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  The maximum number of
*        keywords per FITS card is 20.  Comparisons are performed in
*        uppercase and blanks are removed.  Each keyword must be no
*        longer than 8 characters.  The total length must not exceed
*        48 characters.  This is to allow for the value, and indentation
*        into a blank-keyword card (as hierarchical keywords are not
*        standard and so cannot be part of the standard keyword name).
*     VALUE = <TYPE> (Given)
*        The value to be used to override the original value of the
*        keyword.
*     CMTBGN = CHARACTER * ( 1 ) (Given)
*        The character which indicates the beginning of the comment
*        string of to be appended to the keyword.  Normally it is '/'.
*        when it is blank, no comment will be appended to the keyword.
*     COMNT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The comment string of the keyword.  It may be truncated at the
*        end to put into the space left after writing keyword value.
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true, the specified keyword is present.
*     CARD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the last continuation comment card whose contents
*        are included in the returned string.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each of the data types logical, integer,
*     real and double precision: replace "x" in the routine name by L,
*     I, R or D as appropriate.
*     -  The comments are written from column 32 or higher if the value
*     demands more than the customary 20 characters for the value.  A
*     comment may be omitted if the value is so long to leave no room.
*     -  The BUFFER appears out of standard order because when this
*     routine is called, BUFFER is expected to be a mapped array.
*     This order prevents having to append several %VAL(length)
*     arguments instead of just the one.

*  History:
*     1991 September 9 (WG):
*        Original version.
*     1994 July 16 (MJC):
*        Renamed and tidied.  Fixed violations of the Fortran standard
*        for appending to character-strings.  Fixed bugs that made
*        comments and values uppercase, filtered the comments, and
*        positioned the comment string in the wrong location.  Used
*        parameters to define lengths of the parts of a FITS header
*        card.  Does not attempt to write a blank comment.
*     1996 July 26 (MJC):
*        Allowed for values longer than 20 characters by shifting the
*        comment rightward.  Append the old comment, if requested,
*        after writing the value rather than trying to squeeze the
*        new value into the space left by the old.
*     1996 November 13 (MJC):
*        Renamed from FTS1_WKEYx to FTS1_UKEYx, and calls new
*        FTS1_WKEYx.
