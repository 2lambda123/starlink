*  Name:
*     FTS1_EDKEY

*  Purpose:
*     Edits keywords in a FITS card array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_EDKEY( NOCARD, NKEY, MXCARD, EDITS, NAMES, PSTNS,
*                      KOCCUR, POCCUR, VALUES, COMNTS, TYPES, FTSCAR,
*                      ACTNUM, IARY1, IARY2, CARY, EXISTS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine inserts, updates, moves, deletes, reports, and
*     tests the existence of a number of keyword cards in a FITS-header
*     array.  The occurrence of keywords may be defined, when there are
*     more than one cards of the same name.  The location of each
*     insertion or move is immediately before some occurrence of a
*     corresponding keyword.  The routine returns the modified
*     FITS-header array.

*  Arguments:
*     NOCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of cards in the original FITS array.
*     NKEY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of keyword cards to be inserted into the FITS-header
*        array.
*     MXCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Maximum number of cards in the resultant FITS array.  This must
*        be not less than NOCARD + NKEY + 1.
*     EDITS( MAXMOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The editing commands.  Allowed values are 'Amend', 'Delete', 
*        'Exist', 'Move', 'Rename', 'Print', 'Update', and 'Write'.
*        Each element can be abbreviated to the initial letter.
*
*        'Amend' acts as 'Update' if the keyword exists, but as 'Write'
*        if the keyword is absent.
*
*        'Delete' removes a named keyword.
*
*        'Exist' reports TRUE to standard output if the named keyword
*        exists in the header, and FALSE if the keyword is not present.

*        'Move' relocates a named keyword to be immediately before a
*        second keyword.  When this positional keyword is not supplied,
*        it defaults to the END card, and if the END card is absent,
*        the new location is at the end of the headers.
*
*        'Null' nullifies the value of the named keyword.  Spaces 
*        substitute the keyword's value and equals sign.
*
*        'Print' causes the value of a named keyword to be displayed to
*        standard output.  This will be a blank for a comment card.
*
*        'Rename' renames a keyword, using the value as the new keyword.
*
*        'Update' revises the value and/or the comment.  If a secondary
*        keyword is defined explicitly, the card may be relocated at
*        the same time.  If the secondary keyword does not exist, the
*        card being edited is not moved.  Update requires that the
*        keyword being edited exists.

*        'Write' creates a new card given a value and an optional
*        comment.  Its location uses the same rules as for the Move
*        command.
*     NAMES( NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The names of the keywords to be edited in the FITS card
*        array.  A name may be compound to handle hierarchical
*        keywords, and it has the form keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.
*        The maximum number of keywords per FITS card is twenty.  Each
*        keyword must be no longer than eight characters, and be a valid
*        FITS keyword comprising alphanumeric characters, hyphen, and
*        unsderscore.  Any lowercase letters are converted to uppercase
*        and blanks are removed before inserted or comparison with the
*        existing keywords.
*
*        The keywords ' ', 'COMMENT', and 'HISTORY' are comment cards
*        and do not have a value.
*
*        The keyword must exist except for the Amend, Write, and Exist
*        commands.
*     PSTNS( NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The position keyword names.  A position name may be compound
*        to handle hierarchical keywords, and it has the form
*        keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  The maximum number of
*        keywords per FITS card is twenty.  Each keyword must be no 
*        longer than eight characters.  When locating the position card,
*        comparisons are made in uppercase and with the blanks removed.

*        The new keywords are inserted immediately before each
*        corresponding position keyword.  If any name in it does not
*        exist in FITS array, the consequences will be as follows.  In
*        the Write, Amend (new keyword), and Move edits its 
*        corresponding keyword will be inserted just before the END
*        card or appended to FITS array when the END card does not
*        exist; however, the card is not relocated for an Update or 
*        Amend (with an existing keyword) edit.  If two or more new 
*        cards have the same position name, they will all be put just  
*        before the position name in the same order as they are in 
*        NAMES.
*
*        A positional keyword is used by the Move, Write, Amend, and 
*        Update editing commands.
*     KOCCUR( NKEY ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The occurrences of the NAMES keywords to use.  Values less than
*        or equal to 1 will manipulate the first occurrence of the
*        keyword to insert.
*     POCCUR( NKEY ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The occurrences of the PSTNS keywords to use.  Values less than
*        or equal to 1 will situate the inserted keyword immediately
*        before the first occurrence of the positional keyword.
*     VALUES( NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The new values of the NAMES keywords for the Update and Write
*        editing commands.  The special value '$V' means use the
*        current value of the NAMES keyword.  This makes it possible to
*        modify a comment, leaving the value unaltered.  In addition
*        $V(keyword) requests that the value of the keyword given
*        between the parentheses be assigned to the keyword being
*        edited.  This positional keyword must exist and have a value
*        for a Write edit; whereas the FITS-header value is unchanged
*        for Update if there are problems with this positional keyword.
*        edited.
*        
*        For a Rename edit, VALUES has a different meaning; in this
*        case it stores the replacement keyword name.
*     COMNTS( NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The comments to be written to the NAMES keywords for the Amend,
*        Update, and Write editing commands.  The special value '$C'
*        means use the current comment.  In addition $C(keyword)
*        requests that the comment of the keyword given between the
*        parentheses be assigned to the keyword being edited.  If this
*        positional keyword does not exist the comment is unchanged for
*        Update, and is blank for a Write edit.
*     TYPES( NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The data types of the values to Write or Update.  This does
*        allow some numeric or logical values to be written as strings.
*        These will be one of the following: '_CHAR',  '_DOUBLE',
*        '_INTEGER', '_LOGICAL', '_REAL'.  In addition there are two
*        special values: 'COMMENT' to indicate that the card is a
*        comment (so strictly it has no type), and ' ' to indicate that
*        the data type is unknown, as occurs for a value defined by a
*        reference keyword.  The length should be at least eight
*        characters.
*     FTSCAR( MXCARD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        On entry its first NOCARD elements hold the original FITS
*        cards. On exit, its first ACTNUM elements hold the FITS cards
*        after the insersion.
*     ACTNUM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The actual number of cards in the FITS array after inserting.
*     IARY1( MXCARD ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The first temporary working space.
*     IARY2( MXCARD ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The second temporary working space.
*     CARY( MXCARD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        A temporary working space.
*     EXISTS = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        The result of the last "Exist" operation.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  When an error occurs during editing, warning messages are sent
*     at the normal reporting level, and processing continues to the
*     next editing command.
*     -  The FITS fixed format is used for writing or updating
*     headers, except for double-precision values requiring more space.
*     The comment is delineated from the value by the string ' / '.
*     -  The comments in comment cards begin one space following the
*     keyword or from column 10 whichever is greater.
*     -  At present the following reserved keywords are neither
*     modifiable nor movable: SIMPLE, BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXISn, EXTEND,
*     PCOUNT, GCOUNT, XTENSION, BLOCKED, and END.  This is because
*     order in the extension should be fixed and should not be
*     changed by any routine.
