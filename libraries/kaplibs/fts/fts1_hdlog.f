      SUBROUTINE FTS1_HDLOG( HEADER, FD, CFN, SUBFIL, NHEADS, HDNUM, 
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_HDLOG

*  Purpose:
*     Outputs the FITS header cards to an ASCII file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_HDLOG( HEADER, FD, CFN, SUBFIL, NHEADS, HDNUM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This is a server routine for FITSIN.  It packages up the
*     operations required to write the FITS header cards (80-character)
*     into an ASCII file.  A heading is also written giving the
*     file and sub-file numbers.  The maximum record length of the
*     ASCII file supported by this routine is 132 characters.  The
*     minimum is 80 characters---an error is reported if it is smaller
*     than 80.

*     The file name appears in the caption before the headers.  It may
*     be truncated if it is longer than the file recordsize less 30
*     characters.  Truncation occurs at the start of the name and is
*     designated via an ellipsis.

*  Arguments:
*     HEADER( * ) = CHARACTER * 80 (Given)
*        The FITS headers in 80-character records.
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The file descriptor for the log file.
*     CFN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The input filename or tape file number of the FITS file being
*        processed.
*     SUBFIL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the sub-file/extension within the current FITS
*        file being processed.
*     NHEADS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of header sections in the sub-file.  This includes
*        dummy FITS header sections.
*     HDNUM( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of header cards within each header in the sub-file.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The ASCII file must be opened.

*     1990 November 18 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1991 September 9 (MJC):
*        Corrected bug connected with ASCII record length.  Added
*        leading ellipsis if it is truncated.
*     1992 December (RDS):
*        Modified argument order and made one of the error checks VMS
*        only.
