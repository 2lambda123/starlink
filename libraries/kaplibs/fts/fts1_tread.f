      SUBROUTINE FTS1_TREAD ( FD, BLKSIZ, ACTSIZ, BUFFER, OFFSET,
     :                        RECORD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_TREAD

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a FITS record from a tape file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_TREAD ( FD, BLKSIZ, ACTSIZ, BUFFER, OFFSET, RECORD,
*    :                  STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine reads the byte stream from the FITS tape file
*     and extracts a FITS record of 2880 bytes.  The blocksize of
*     the tape file is arbitrary save that it be no more than the
*     maximum FITS blocksize of 28800. 

*  Arguments:
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The tape descriptor.
*     BLKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum blocksize and dimension of the tape block.
*     ACTSIZ = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The actual block size.  This need not be a multiple of the
*        FITS record length of 2880 bytes.  It must be known on input.
*     BUFFER( ACTSIZ ) = BYTE (Given and Returned)
*        The buffer containing the block of data. This is only read
*        when %OFFSET does not equal %ACTSIZ, i.e. there are some
*        non-header data within it.
*     OFFSET = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of bytes in the current block already interpreted.
*     RECORD( 2880 ) = BYTE (Returned)
*        The current FITS record.  Successive calls will read of the
*        FITS records in sequence.
*     STATUS  = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     There are two modes of operation: where the tape blocks are
*     smaller than the FITS record length of 2880 bytes, or where the
*     block length is greater or equal to the FITS record.
*     -  If the latter, copy a whole FITS record from the tape provided
*     there are sufficient bytes remaining, incrementing the offset by
*     a record length.  Otherwise fill the record in two stages, the
*     second after reading a new tape block.  The new offset is
*     calculated.
*     -  If the former, copy any remainder of a tape block to the FITS
*     record.  Find the number of whole tape blocks will fit in the
*     remainder of the FITS record.  Read this number of tape blocks
*     and copy them to the FITS record.  If the FITS record is not
*     complete read the next tape record, and fill the record. Finally,
*     compute the offset within the current tape block.

*  Prior requirements:
*     -  The tape file should already be open and the first block
*     read.
