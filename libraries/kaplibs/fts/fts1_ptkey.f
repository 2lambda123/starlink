      SUBROUTINE FTS1_PTKEY( FTSLOC, NKEY, NAMES, PSTNS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_PTKEY

*  Purpose:
*     Puts non-reserved keyword cards into the FITS extension of an NDF
*     file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_PTKEY( FTSLOC, NKEY, NAMES, PSTNS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine inserts a number of non-reserved keyword cards
*     into the FITS extension of an NDF file at the positions just
*     before a specified keyword card.  If a keyword card exists in the
*     extension, the routine will move the card to the specified
*     position.  This provides a way to relocate the existing keyword
*     card.  If a keyword card does not exist in the extension, the
*     routine will put the keyword card at the specified position and
*     will add an equals sign to it, at column 9 for simple keywords or
*     immediately after the keyword for compound ones.  To those newly
*     added keywords, a character value '{undefined}' is assigned.  To
*     write new values for these keywords, you should use subroutine
*     FTS1_WKEYx.
*
*     Following keywords are regarded as reserved keywords: SIMPLE,
*     BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXISn, EXTEND, PCOUNT, GCOUNT and XTENSION.
*     Their order in the extension should be fixed and should not be
*     changed by any routine.  Therefore if any of them is included in
*     the NAMES, it will be ignored.
*
*     This subroutine can not be used to insert comment cards, that is,
*     the cards with keyword 'COMMENT' or 'HISTORY', etc.
*
*  Arguments:
*     FTSLOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The locator to the FITS extension of the NDF.
*     NKEY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of keyword cards to be inserted into the FITS
*        extension.
*     NAMES( NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The names of the keywords to be inserted.  This may be a
*        compound name to handle hierarchical keywords, and it has the
*        form keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  The maximum number of
*        keywords per FITS card is 20.  Each keyword must be no longer
*        than 8 characters.  When inserted, the lower case letters are
*        converted to uppercase and blanks are removed.
*     PSTNS( NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The names of the cards before which the corresponding new
*        keyword cards are inserted.  If any name in PSTNS does not
*        exist in the original FITS card array or is blank, its
*        corresponding new card will be inserted just before end-card
*        or be appended to the original FITS card array when there is no
*        end-card.  If two or more new cards have the same PSTNS name,
*        they will all be put before the PSTNS name in the same order
*        as they are in NAMES.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The FITS extension is mapped for update access.  It therefore must
*     have some values assigned before using the routine.
