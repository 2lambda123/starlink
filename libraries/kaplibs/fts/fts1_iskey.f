      SUBROUTINE FTS1_ISKEY( KEYWRD, VALID, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_ISKEY

*  Purpose:
*     Inquires whether or not a string is a valid FITS keyword.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_ISKEY( KEYWRD, VALID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine tests whether a given string would be a valid FITS
*     header keyword or not.  For a keyword to be valid it must be
*     no more than eight characters, and must comprise only uppercase
*     Latin letters, numbers, underscore, and hyphen.

*  Arguments:
*     KEYWRD = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The string to be tested.
*     VALID = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true, the string is a valid FITS header keyword.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     This routine does not convert the string to uppercase or remove
*     leading blanks before validation.
