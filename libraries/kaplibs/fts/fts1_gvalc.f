      SUBROUTINE FTS1_GVALC( HEADER, CSTART, CEND, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_GVALC

*  Purpose:
*     Extracts a string value from a FITS header.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_GVALC( HEADER, CSTART, CEND, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routines determines the location of a character value within
*     a FITS header and hence the value itself.  The location of the
*     delimiting quote marks and string value are returned.

*  Arguments:
*     HEADER = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The FITS header 'card' whose value is to be extractd.
*     CSTART = INTEGER (Given)
*        The column containing the leading quote of the string value.
*        This is set to zero if no string value could be found.
*     CEND = INTEGER (Given)
*        The column containing the trailing quote of the string value.
*        This is set to zero if no string value could be found.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The character value.  CARD should contain at least 68
*        characters.  A blabnnk string is returned if the header failed
*        to contain a character value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  It is assumed that the header conforms to the FITS Standard,
*     with one exception.  Single quotes within a string---these should
*     be doubled---are detected provided that the next solidus after a
*     single quote will be a comment delimiter rather than literal text
*     in the string.

*  Determine where the trailing quote is located.
*  ==============================================

*  First look for any double quotes.  These mean a single quote, so
*  O'Hara appears as O''Hara in a FITS card image.  Start the search
*  immediately after the leading quote, and subsequently immediately
*  following a double quote.  Prevent the search extending beyond the
*  end of the value.  Keep a count of the absolute column.  Enclosed
*  quotes that should be double but are single will be tested for
*  later.

*  If there is no double quote no action is necessary.  When there is,
*  we form part of the value, removing the second quote.

*  Increment the counter in the FITS card, skipping over the double
*  quote.

            END IF
         END DO

*  We need some method for detecting single quotes within the string.
*  Any that lie before the last correctly doubled quote will be in the
*  string.  The single quotes get doubled later.  The following
*  algorithm is far from foolproof, but it will catch some errors in
*  the input card.
*
*  The method assumes that the next slash will be a comment rather than
*  literal text in the string.  Find the location of the comment
*  delimiter.  Start just before the normal position just in case some
*  characters have been removed before it, but not too far in case we
*  confuse a slash in the value with the comment delimiter when there
*  is no closing quote.  When there is no comment delimiter, the search
*  for the closing quote continues to the end of the card.  Specify the
*  position of the notional closing quote.
