      SUBROUTINE FTS1_AXIS( NCARD, HEADER, SCARD, NDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_AXIS

*  Purpose:
*     Create an axis structure within an NDF from FITS header
*     information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_AXIS( NCARD, HEADER, SCARD, NDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches the FITSD header for the keywords that
*     describe the axis structure.  If at least one reference value,
*     CRVALn, exists then an axis component is created and filled with
*     the appropriate values.  CDELTn defines the step between axis
*     values.  If it is not present in the header it is set to 1.
*     CRPIXn defines the reference pixel to which the reference value
*     corresponds.  If is absent form the header pixel 1 is assumed to
*     be the reference pixel.  If CTYPEn is in the header it is used to
*     assigned a value to the nth axis's label component.
*
*     The precision of the output axis-centre array depends on the
*     absolute relative size of the offset to the scale.  Single
*     precision is used if this ratio is greater than one hundred times
*     the floating-point precision.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of card images in the buffer.
*     HEADER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * 80 (Given)
*        The FITS header 'cards', each element corresponding to a
*        80-character card.
*     SCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from where the search will begin.  This
*        is needed because the headers make contain a dummy header
*        prior to an extension.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier for the NDF to contain the axis structure.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
