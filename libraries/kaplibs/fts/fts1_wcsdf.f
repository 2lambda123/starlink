      LOGICAL FUNCTION FTS1_WCSDF( ENCOD, FS1, FS2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_WCSDF

*  Purpose:
*     Sees if two FrameSets are different after being written to a
*     FitsChan.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RETURN = FTS1_WCSDF( ENCOD, FS1, FS2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The returned function value indicates if the two FrameSets are
*     inconsistent with each other. The two supplied FrameSets are written
*     to two FitsChans, using the specified encoding. All keyword values
*     in the two FitsChans are then compared. If any keyword has a
*     significantly different value in the two FitsChans, then the
*     FrameSets are inconsistent, and a .TRUE value is returned. Otherwise,
*     .FALSE. is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     ENCOD = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The encoding scheme to use when converting the supplied
*        FrameSets into FITS header cards.
*     FS1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to the first FrameSet.
*     FS2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to the second FrameSet.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Function Value:
*     FTS1_WCSDF = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        .TRUE. if the supplied FrameSets are inconsistent, and .FALSE.
*        otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  A value of .TRUE. is returned if an error has already occurred,
*     or if this function should fail for any reason.
