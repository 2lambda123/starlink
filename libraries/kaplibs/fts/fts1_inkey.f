*  Name:
*     FTS1_INKEY

*  Purpose:
*     Insert keywords to a FITS card array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_INKEY( NOLDCA, NKEY, NAMES, PSTNS, FTSCAR,
*     :                ACTNUM, IARY1, IARY2, CARY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine inserts a number of keyword cards into a
*     FITS-header array just before some given keywords, and returns
*     the position of these newly inserted cards in the FITS array
*     after insertion.  If a given position keyword is not in the FITS
*     header or is blank, its corresponding keyword card will be
*     inserted just before the end card or appended to the present FITS
*     array when end card does not exist.  If a keyword card to be
*     inserted already exists in the FITS array, that card will
*     be deleted and moved to the specified position.  For those new
*     keyword cards, an equals sign '=' will be put at the 9th column
*     for simple keyword or immediately after keywords for compound
*     ones; and a character value '{undefined}' will be given to them.
*
*     The following reserved keywords are not modified: SIMPLE, BITPIX,
*     NAXIS, NAXISn, EXTEND, PCOUNT, GCOUNT, XTENSION, BLOCKED, and END.

*  Arguments:
*     NOLDCA = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of cards in the original FITS array.
*     NKEY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of keyword cards to be inserted into the FITS-header
*        array.
*     NAMES( NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The keywords to be inserted into FITS card array.
*     PSTNS( NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The position keyword names, before them the new keywords is
*        inserted.  If any name in it does not exit in FITS array, its
*        corresponding keyword will be inserted just before the end card
*        or appended to FITS array when end card does not exist.  If two
*        or more new cards have the same position name, they will all be
*        put just before the position name in the same order as they are
*        in NAMES.
*     FTSCAR( NOLDCA + NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        On entry its first NOLDCA elements hold the original FITS
*        cards. On exit, its first ACTNUM elements hold the FITS cards
*        after the insersion.
*     ACTNUM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The actual number of cards in the FITS array after inserting.
*     IARY1( NOLDCA + NKEY ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The first temporary working space.
*     IARY2( NOLDCA + NKEY ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The second temporary working space.
*     CARY( NOLDCA + NKEY ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        A temporary working space.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
