      SUBROUTINE FTS1_VHEAD( BUFFER, FIXED, CARD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_VHEAD

*  Purpose:
*     Validates a FITS header card and reconstitutes to the standard.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_VHEAD( BUFFER, FIXED, CARD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routines takes a buffer containing text similar to a FITS
*     header card and attempts to produce a correctly formatted FITS
*     header card.  The validation process performs the following
*     checks the input buffer:
*       a) the length of the input buffer is no more than 80
*       characters, otherwise it is truncated;
*       b) the keyword only contains uppercase Latin alphabetic
*       characters, numbers, underscore, and hyphen (this is a fatal
*       error except for lowercase letters);
*       c) value cards have an equals sign in column 9 and a space in
*       column 10;
*       d) quotes enclose character values;
*       e) single quotes inside string values are doubled;
*       f) character values are left justified to column 11 (retaining
*       leading blanks) and contain at least 8 characters (padding with
*       spaces if necessary);
*       g) non-character values are right justified to column 30 for
*       mandatory keywords, or when the fixed format is requested
*       (unless the value is double-precision requiring more than 20
*       digits);
*       h) the comment delimiter is in column 32 for the mandatory
*       keywords or when the fixed format is requested for non-character
*       values, or is at least two characters following the value
*       otherwise;
*       i) an equals sign in column 9 of a commentary card is replaced
*       by a space, issuing a warning message at normal reporting
*       level; and
*       j) comments begin at least two columns after the end of the
*       comment delimiter.
*
*     Some non-fatal errors---a), b), c), d), and i)---produce warning
*     messages at message level MSG__NORM.

*  Arguments:
*     BUFFER = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The FITS header 'card' to be validated.
*     FIXED = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If this is .TRUE., all values use the FITS fixed format with
*        left-justified character strings starting two columns after
*     CARD = CHARACTER * ( 80 ) (Returned)
*        The validated FITS header 'card'.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     1994 September 8 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1996 July 26 (MJC):
*        Distinguish between mandatory and other keywords for
*        non-character values.  Add the FIXED argument.
*     21-MAR-2000 (DSB):
*        Modified to retain trailing spaces within string values.
*        Fixed bug which caused random character strings to be used as
*        comments for string keywords if no comment was supplied in the
*        header.
*     2-NOV-2000 (DSB):
*        Modified to accept:
*         - blank keyword values
*         - missing equals sign (but only iof the value is blank)
*        Also fixed bug which caused comments to be lost if they abut 
*        the keyword value.
*     2009 January 11 (MJC):
*        Use new FTS1_GVALC routine to find the location of a string
*        value, and extract the string.
