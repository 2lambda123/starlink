*  Name:
*     FTS1_PHEAD

*  Purpose:
*     Process the headers in a FITS file on tape or disk.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_PHEAD( BFPNTR, RCPNTR, RECORD, MEDIUM, MD, LOC, BLKSIZ, 
*    :                 MAXHDR, REPORT, ACTSIZ, OFFSET, CURREC, HSTART,
*    :                 HDNUM, EXTEND, NHEADS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine reads selected files off a FITS tape or disk and
*     writes the header data into an HDS file, and they are reported to
*     the user.  The dimension of the HDS buffer array in the HDS
*     structure is enlarged if the buffer is filled.  The number of
*     bytes of header cards in the last data block (of the current
*     file) containing header data is returned.  This is to enable
*     other routines to know where the data array starts in that
*     buffer.  If this number equals the actual blocksize this means a
*     new data block needs to be read to access the data array.

*  Arguments:
*     BFPNTR = INTEGER  (Given)
*        Pointer to the BUFFER byte array
*     RCPNTR = INTEGER  (Given)
*        Pointer to the RECORD byte array
*     RECORD( 36 ) = CHARACTER * ( 80 ) (Given and Returned)
*        The buffer to hold the current FITS record.  Note that this
*        out of order for SGP/16, but it is needed here so that a
*        mapped array may be passed.  This is a temporary kludge until
*        the FITS readers are redesigned.
*     MEDIUM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The medium containing the FITS file.  Currently supported are
*        'DISK' for a disk file, and 'TAPE' for standard magnetic tape.
*     MD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The tape or file descriptor depending on the value of %MEDIUM.
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given)
*        The locator to the HDS object that will contain the header
*        cards.
*     BLKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum blocksize and dimension of the data buffer.
*     MAXHDR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of header sections in the current sub-file.
*     REPORT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true the header cards are reported to the user.
*     ACTSIZ = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The actual block size (a multiple of the FITS record length of
*        2880 bytes).  It is only an input argument for
*        %MEDIUM = 'DISK'.
*     OFFSET = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of bytes in the current block already interpreted
*        as the header plus any earlier sub files.
*     CURREC = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        If true the current FITS record is to be used immediately, i.e.
*        it has alrady been read from tape or disk into %RECORD.  On
*        exit it is true when a new record has been read to determine
*        whether or not there is an extension, but no extension is
*        found.
*     HSTART( MAXHDR ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the header card where each FITS header starts.
*     HDNUM( MAXHDR ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of header records processed and stored in the
*        output data structure, one per header section in the current
*        sub-file.
*     EXTEND = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true there are extensions in the FITS sub-file.
*     NHEADS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of header sections in the sub-file.  This includes
*        dummy FITS header sections.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     Initialise variables including number of the first card, total
*       number of cards, start and count of cards per header section
*     Find the size of the preallocated header area
*     If an error then
*        Report context and abort
*     Endif
*     If the block has been fully processed then
*        Read a new block from the tape or record from disk
*        If an error has occurred, report it and abort
*        Reset number of the card within block
*     Endif
*     Initialise loop flag
*     See if header belongs to an extension
*     For all cards
*        If the last card switch loop flag
*        If primary header see if extensions could follow
*        Increment number of header cards---total and per section
*        Report record to the user if requested
*        If preallocated object's size is too small then
*           Increase its size
*           If an error has occurred, report it and abort
*        Endif
*        Write card to the data structure
*        If an error has occurred, report it and abort
*        If the last card of the data block has been processed then
*           Read a new block from the tape or FITS record from the file
*           If an error has occurred, report it and abort
*           Reset number of card within block
*        Else
*           Increment number of card within block
*        Endif
*     Endfor
*     If there is space to store possible extensions then
*        Skip to the end of the record, incrementing the card counter
*        If the last card of the data block has been processed then
*           Read a new block from the tape or FITS record from the file
*           If an error has occurred, report it and abort
*           Set flag to indicate a new block has been read in which
*             there may be no extension
*           Reset number of card within block
*        Endif
*        If the first card indicates an extension header follows then
*           Increment header count and set extension-present flag
*           Initialise card count for the new header section and find
*             start card for the section
*           Switch new-block flag off as it contains an extension header
*           For all cards
*              If the last card switch loop flag
*              Increment number of header cards---total and per section
*              Report record to the user if requested
*                 If preallocated object's size is too small then
*                 Increase its size
*                 If an error has occurred, report it and abort
*              Endif
*              Write card to the data structure
*              If the last card of the data block has been processed
*                then
*                 Read a new block from the tape or FITS record from
*                   the file
*                 If an error has occurred, report it and abort
*                 Reset number of card within block
*              Else
*                 Increment number of card within block
*              Endif
*           Enddo
*        Else
*           More data to follow so exit from the loop
*        Endif
*     Endfor
*     Find number of bytes in the current block that are header
*       information, noting the special case when a new block has been
*       read, but does not begin with a header section.
*     Truncate the size of the header object
*     If an error has occurred report it
*     End

*  History:
*     1987 Jul 8 (PMA):
*        Original version.
*     1988 May   (MJC):
*        Tidied to KAPPA style, adding comments and error reports.
*     1988 Sep 19 (MJC):
*        Converted to blocked FITS tapes and reordered the arguments.
*     1988 Nov 3  (MJC):
*        Added report option and completed the description.
*     1989 Jul 21 (MJC):
*        Allowed for extensions.
*     1989 Nov 22 (MJC):
*        Reads OFFSET to determine starting card for sub files; allow
*        for tape buffer to start at an extension, i.e. it has followed
*        some data; and completed Method section .
*     1989 Nov 24 (MJC):
*        Change to use OFFSET=ACTSIZ meaning block is exhausted rather
*        than the counter-intuitive 0; fixed computation of number of
*        blank cards to skip; and corrected offset computation for the
*        case when an extension header was looked for, but not found.
*     1990 Jan 11 (MJC):
*        Moved misplaced parenthesis when input offset is non-zero.
*     1990 Oct 29 (MJC):
*        An additional block could be read if the END statement of an
*        extension occurs at the last line of a block due to a missing
*        logical check---now corrected.
*     1990 November 19 (MJC):
*        Renamed from FITSPH; HEADER, BUFSIZ arguments removed and
*        HSTART added, and converted to the SST prologue style.
*     1990 November 30 (MJC):
*        Added MEDIUM, CURREC and RECORD arguments; and permitted
*        disk-file access; altered to process FITS records rather than
*        blocks (needed for disk access but made consistent by doing the
*        same for tape).
*     1992 December (RDS):
*        Changed the argument order to help with portability.  Instead
*        of passing BUFFER in as a character array it now just gets the
*        pointer to the data. RECORD is still passed in a character
*        array but the pointer to the RECORD array is also passed in.
*        The first call to the Disc-FITS reading subroutine initialises 
*        the record number in direct-access reads.
*     1996 July 25 (MJC):
*        Obtain the value of EXTEND correctly, i.e. not assume that it
*        is column 30.
*     1996 November 24 (MJC):
*        Revised FTS1_GKEYx calls.
*     2004 September 1 (TIMJ):
*        Use CNF_PVAL
