      SUBROUTINE FTS1_CHVAW( EL, INARR, OLDVAL, NEWVAL, OUTARR,
     :                         NREP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_CHVAx
 
*  Purpose:
*     Replaces all occurrences of a value in an array with another
*     value.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_CHVAx( EL, INARR, OLDVAL, NEWVAL, OUTARR, NREP, STATUS )
 
*  Description:
*     This routine copies the input array to the output array, except
*     where a specified value occurs, and this is replaced with a new
*     value throughout the output array.
 
*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimension of the input and output arrays.
*     INARR( EL ) = ? (Given)
*        The input array.
*     OLDVAL = ? (Given)
*        Value to be replaced.
*     NEWVAL = ? (Given)
*        New value to be substituted for the old value.
*     OUTARR( EL ) = ? (Returned)
*        The output array containing the modified values.
*     NREP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of replacements made.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.
 
*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric data type: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as appropriate. The
*     arrays and values supplied to the routine must have the data type
*     specified.
 
*  Algorithm:
*     -  To avoid testing two floating-point values for equality, they
*     are tested to be different by less than a small fraction of
*     the value to be replaced.  The machine precision defines the
*     minimum detectable difference.
*     -  For all pixels, if pixel value is the value to be removed then
*     replace old value in data array with the new value, otherwise
*     copy the input value to the output array.
