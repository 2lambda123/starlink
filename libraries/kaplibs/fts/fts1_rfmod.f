*  Name:
*     FTS1_RFMOD

*  Purpose:
*     Reads a text file containing instructions for editing an NDF's
*     FITS extension.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_RFMOD( FD, MAXMOD, NWRITE, EDITS, KEYWDS, KEYPOS,
*                      KOCCUR, POCCUR, VALUES, COMNTS, TYPES, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routines opens a text file and parses it to determine how to
*     modify an NDF's FITS extension.  Details of the format and its
*     interpretation is given in the item called "File Format".  The
*     routine returns the editing command, keyword, position, values,
*     comment, and data type in arrays.

*  Arguments:
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FIO identifier of the text file containing the editing
*        instructions.
*     MAXMOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of modifications.
*     NWRITE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of modifications actually made.
*     EDITS( MAXMOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The editing commands.  Thus need only be one character per
*        element.
*     KEYWDS( MAXMOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The FITS keywords to be modified into FITS card array.  The
*        length should be at least 48 characters to allow for
*        hierarchical keywords.
*     KEYPOS( MAXMOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The position keyword names.  The new keywords are inserted
*        immediately before each corresponding position keyword.
*        The length should be at least 48 characters to allow for
*        hierarchical keywords.
*     KOCCUR( MAXMOD ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The occurrences of the KEYWDS keywords to use.
*     POCCUR( MAXMOD ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The occurrences of the KEYPOS keywords to use.
*     VALUES( MAXMOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The values to be given to the KEYWDS keywords.  The length
*        should be at least 68 characters to allow for the maximum
*        length of a value.
*     COMNTS( MAXMOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The comments of the NAME keywords to use.  The length should
*        be at least 68 characters to allow for the maximum length of a
*        comment, but normally 50 should be adequate.
*     TYPES( MAXMOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The data types of the values to write.  These will be one of
*        the following: '_CHAR',  '_DOUBLE', '_INTEGER', '_LOGICAL',
*        '_REAL'.  In addition there are two special values: 'COMMENT'
*        to indicate that the card is a comment (so strictly it has no
*        type), and ' ' to indicate that the data type is unknown, as
*        occurs for a value defined by a reference keyword.  The length
*        should be at least 8 characters.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  File Format:
*     The file consists of a series of lines, one per editing
*     instruction, although blank lines and lines beginning with a ! or
*     # are treated as comments.  Note that the order does matter, as
*     the edits are performed in the order given.
*
*     The format is summarised below:
*
*       command keyword{[occur]}{(keyword{[occur]})} {value {comment}}
*
*     where braces indicate optional values, and occur is the
*     occurrence of the keyword.  In effect there are four fields
*     delineated by spaces that define the edit operation, keyword,
*     value and comment.
*
*     Field 1:  This specifies the editing operation.  Allowed values
*     are Delete, Exist, Move, Read, Write, and Update, and can be
*     abbreviated to the initial letter.  Delete removes a named
*     keyword.  Read causes the value of a named keyword to be
*     displayed to standard output.  Exist reports TRUE to standard
*     output if the named keyword exists in the header, and FALSE if
*     the keyword is not present.  Move relocates a named keyword to be
*     immediately before a second keyword.  When this positional
*     keyword is not supplied, it defaults to the END card, and if the
*     END card is absent, the new location is at the end of the
*     headers.  Write creates a new card given a value and an optional
*     comment.  Its location uses the same rules as for the Move
*     command.  Update revises the value and/or the comment.  If a
*     secondary keyword is defined explicitly, the card may be
*     relocated at the same time.  Update requires that the keyword
*     exists.

*     Field 2:  This specifies the keyword to edit, and optionally the
*     position of that keyword in the header after the edit (for Move,
*     Write and Update edits).  The new position in the header is
*     immediately before a positional keyword, whose name is given in
*     parentheses concatenated to the edit keyword.  See "Field 1" for
*     defaulting when the position parameter is not defined or is null.
*
*     Both the editing keyword and position keyword may be compound to
*     handle hierarchical keywords.  In this case the form is
*     keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  All keywords must be valid FITS
*     keywords.  This means they must be no more than 8 characters
*     long, and the only permitted characters are uppercase alphabetic,
*     numbers, hyphen, and underscore.  Invalid keywords will be
*     rejected.
*
*     Both the edit and position keyword may have an occurrence
*     specified in brackets [].  This enables editing of a keyword that
*     is not the first occurrence of that keyword, or locate a edited
*     keyword not at the first occurrence of the positional keyword.
*     Note that it is not normal to have multiple occurrences of a
*     keyword in a FITS header, unless it is blank, COMMENT or HISTORY.
*     Any text other than a positive integer is interpreted as the
*     first occurrence.

*     Use a null value ('' or "") if you want the card to be a comment
*     with keyword other than COMMENT or HISTORY.  As blank keywords are
*     used for hierarchical keywords, to write a comment in a blank
*     keyword you must give a null edit keyword.  These have no keyword
*     appears before the left parenthesis or bracket, such as (), [],
*     [2], or (EPOCH).

*     Field 3:
*     This specifies the value to assign to the edited keyword in the
*     the Write and Update operations, or the name of the new keyword
*     in the Rename modification.  If the keyword exists, the existing
*     value or keyword is replaced, as appropriate.  The data type used
*     to store the value is inferred from the value itself.  See topic
*     "Value Data Types".
*
*     For the Update and Write modifications there is a special value,
*     $V, which means use the current value of the edited keyword,
*     provided that keyword exists.  This makes it possible to modify a
*     comment, leaving the value unaltered.  In addition $V(keyword)
*     requests that the value of the keyword given between the
*     parentheses be assigned to the keyword being edited.
*
*     The value field is ignored when the keyword is COMMENT, HISTORY
*     or blank and the modification is an Update or Write.
*
*     Field 4:
*     This specifies the comment to assign to the edited keyword for the
*     Write and Update operations.  A leading '/' should not be
*     supplied.

*     There is a special value, $C, which means use the current comment
*     of the edited keyword, provided that keyword exists.  This makes
*     it possible to modify a value, leaving the comment unaltered.  In
*     addition $C(keyword) requests that the comment of the keyword
*     given between the parentheses be assigned to the edited keyword.
*
*     To obtain leading spaces before some commentary, use a quote (')
*     or double quote (") as the first character of the comment.  There
*     is no need to terminate the comment with a trailing and matching
*     quotation character.  Also do not double quotes should one form
*     part of the comment.

*  Value Data Types:
*     The data type of the value is determined as follows:
*        - Values enclosed in quotes (') or doubled quotes (") are
*        strings.  Note that numeric or logical string values must
*        be quoted to prevent them being converted to a numeric or
*        logical value in the FITS extension.
*        - Otherwise type conversions of the first word after the
*        keywords are made to integer, double precision, and logical
*        types in turn.  If a conversion is successful, that becomes the
*        data type.  In the case of double precision, the type is set
*        to real when the number of significant digits only warrants
*        single precision.  If all the conversions failed the value
*        is deemed to be a string.

*  Examples of the File Format:
*     The best way to illustrate the options is by listing some example
*     lines.
*     
*         P AIRMASS
*     This reports the value of keyword AIRMASS to standard output.
*
*         E FILTER
*     This determines whether keyword FILTER exists and reports TRUE or
*     FALSE to standard output.
*
*         D OFFSET
*     This deletes the keyword OFFSET.
*
*         Delete OFFSET[2]
*     This deletes any second occurrence of keyword OFFSET.
*
*         Rename OFFSET1[2] OFFSET2
*     This renames the second occurrence of keyword OFFSET1 to have
*     keyword OFFSET2.
*
*         W AIRMASS 1.379
*     This writes a real value to new keyword AIRMASS, which will be
*     located at the end of the FITS extension.
*
*         W FILTER(AIRMASS) Y
*     This writes a logical true value to new keyword FILTER, which
*     will be located just before the AIRMASS keyword, if it exists.
*
*         Write FILTER(AIRMASS) 'Y'
*     As the preceding example except that this writes a character
*     value "Y".
*
*         W COMMENT(AIRMASS) . Following values apply to mid-observation
*     This writes a COMMENT card immediately before the AIRMASS card,
*     the comment being "Following values apply to mid-observation".
*
*         W DROCOM(AIRMASS) '' Following values apply to mid-observation
*     As the preceding example but this writes to a non-standard
*     comment keyword called DROCOM.  Note the need to supply a null
*     value.
*
*         W (AIRMASS) '' Following values apply to mid-observation
*     As the preceding example but this writes to a blank-keyword
*     comment.  
*
*         U OBSERVER "Dr. Peter O'Leary" Name of principal observer
*     This updates the OBSERVER keyword with the string value
*     "Dr. Peter O'Leary", and comment "Name of principal observer".
*     Note that had the value been enclosed in single quotes ('), the
*     apostrophe would need to be doubled.
*
*         M OFFSET
*     This moves the keyword OFFSET to just before the END card.
*
*         Move OFFSET(SCALE)
*     This moves the keyword OFFSET to just before the SCALE card.
*
*         Move OFFSET[2](COMMENT[3])
*     This moves the second occurrence of keyword OFFSET to just
*     before the third COMMENT card.
