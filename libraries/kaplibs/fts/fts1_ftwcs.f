      SUBROUTINE FTS1_FTWCS( NCARD, HEADER, SCARD, INDF, NENCOD, ENCODS,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_FTWCS

*  Purpose:
*     Uses coordinate system information in the supplied FITS headers
*     to create WCS and AXIS components in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_FTWCS( NCARD, HEADER, SCARD, INDF, NENCOD, ENCODS,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This constructs an AST FrameSet from the supplied FITS headers
*     and adds it into the existing WCS information in the supplied NDF.
*     It can also create AXIS structures (see below).
*
*     The information needed to create the FrameSet can be stored
*     several times in a single FITS header, using different keywords
*     each time. Each of these descriptions is known as an "encoding"
*     and AST supports several different encoding schemes (e.g.
*     FITS-WCS, FITS-IRAF, DSS, NATIVE).  If the supplied FITS header
*     contains more than one encoding then we need to choose which one
*     to use. This decision is important because is is possible for
*     encodings to be inconsistent (i.e. software may modify one
*     encoding without making equivalent modifications to the other
*     encodings). The simplest way to make this decision is to hand
*     responsibility for it over to the user. In this case, the user
*     supplies a list of preferred encodings, and the first of these
*     encodings that exists in the FITS header gets used. If the user
*     does not know which encoding to use, then we can make an
*     intelligent guess by comparing the encodings to see which ones are
*     consistent and which ones are not.
*
*     In addition to the WCS component, this routine also creates AXIS
*     Centre, Label and Units components in the NDF, but only if they do
*     not already exist, and if the FrameSet read from the FITS header
*     contains an AXIS Frame. NDF2FITS does not write out the AXIS Frame
*     if it is equivalent to pixel co-ordinates, and so no AXIS
*     structures will be created by this routine in this case. Also, if
*     the AXIS Frame represents linear axis co-ordinates, then there
*     will already be AXIS structures in the NDF (created earlier within
*     FITSIN), and so again no AXIS  structures will be created by this
*     routine. Thus, this routine will only create AXIS structures in
*     the cases where the axis co-ordinates are non-linear.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of cards in the array of headers, from the start of
*        the first header section to the end of the current one.
*     HEADER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * 80 (Given)
*        The buffer containing the header card images.
*     SCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from where searches will begin, and
*        copying of the headers to the FITS extension.   Therefore
*        NCARD - SCARD + 1 headers will appear in the extension. This
*        argument is needed because the headers make contain a dummy
*        header prior to an extension.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     NENCOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of encodings supplied in ENCODS.
*     ENCODS( NENCOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The user's preferred AST encodings. If NENCOD is zero, then
*        this is ignored, and an intelligent guess is made as to which
*        encoding to use (see FTS1_WCSIM).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     9-JUN-1998 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     14-SEP-1998 (DSB):
*        Changed to report the first 3 bad header cards.
*     9-DEC-1998 (DSB):
*        Included FITS-IRAF encoding. Do not flush errors reported
*        within this routine. The caller now has responsibility for
*        this.
*     16-DEC-1999 (DSB):
*        Added call to FTS1_ASTWN to report warning messages stored in
*        the FitsChan by AST.
