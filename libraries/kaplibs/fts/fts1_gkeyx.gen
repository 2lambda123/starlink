      SUBROUTINE FTS1_GKEY<T>( NCARD, BUFFER, SCARD, NAME, NOCCUR,
     :                         THERE, VALUE, COMENT, CARD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_GKEYx

*  Purpose:
*     Gets the value and comment of a named header of type <COMM> from
*     a buffer of FITS-header card images.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_GKEYx( NCARD, BUFFER, SCARD, NAME, NOCCUR, THERE,
*                      VALUE, COMENT, CARD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine searches a buffer containing the header card images
*     from a FITS file for a keyword NAME; and returns its value and
*     comment, and the number of the card image within the buffer array
*     that contains the named keyword.  The search ends when the next
*     end of a header block, marked by the END keyword, is encountered
*     or the buffer is exhausted.  If the keyword is present, THERE is
*     .TRUE., otherwise it is .FALSE.   Since all cards images are in
*     character format, type conversion is performed.  An error status
*     will be returned if the conversion has failed.  If the keyword
*     expected to be present more than once, then the argument NOCCUR
*     controls which occurrence will be retrieved.  If a keyword is not
*     found, then no error results and the argument VALUE remains
*     unmodified.
*
*     The name may be compound to permit reading of hierarchical
*     keywords.  This routine will probably only work for HISTORY,
*     COMMENT and ' ' (blank) if there is just one value given on the
*     line, i.e. only one "keyword = value" before any comment
*     marker.  An error will result otherwise.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of card images in the buffer.
*     BUFFER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * 80 (Given)
*        The buffer containing the header card images.
*     SCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from where the search will begin.  This
*        is needed because the headers may contain a dummy header
*        prior to an extension.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the keyword whose value is required.  This may be
*        a compound name to handle hierarchical keywords, and it has
*        the form keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  The maximum number of
*        keywords per FITS card is 20.  Comparisons are performed in
*        uppercase and blanks are removed.  Each keyword must be no
*        longer than 8 characters.
*     NOCCUR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value of this argument specifies which occurrence of a
*        keyword should be used, if multiple ones are expected.  Any
*        value less than or equal to 1 indicates the first occurrence.
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If .TRUE., the keyword given by argument NAME is present,
*        regardless of the exit status.
*     VALUE = ? (Returned)
*        The value of the keyword.
*     COMENT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The comment associated with the keyword.
*     CARD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the card containing the named keyword.  If the
*        card could not be found this is set to zero.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Notes:
*     - There is a routine for each of the data types logical, integer,
*     real and double precision: replace "x" in the routine name by
*     L, I, R or D as appropriate.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Initialise counter and flag.  Test whether the input name is
*     compound by looking for the delimiter.
*     -  If it is not compound loop for all cards until the last card,
*     or the requested card is located.  Compare each card with the
*     desired keyword.  Once the required occurrence of the card is
*     found, set returned flag to say keyword has been found, convert
*     from a character string to the value by extracting the next word
*     after the equals sign, otherwise go to the next card.
*     -  For a compound name loop for all cards until the last card,
*     or the requested card is located.  Go to the next card if the
*     current card does not contain an equals sign.  Generate the
*     compound keyword from the keywords before the equals sign.
*     Compare the compound keyword with the desired name.  Once the
*     required occurrence of the card is found set the returned flag to
*     say keyword has been found, find the extent of the value in the
*     card by finding any comment delimeter, convert from a character
*     string to the value, otherwise go to the next card.
*     -  Reset card number to zero if the keyword is not present

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Cannot handle character data because the arguments to CHR_CTOC
*     are different from the other CHR_CTOx routines.  Also the
*     extraction of the value and allowing for quotes is quite
*     different.  The imaginary portion of complex data is not
*     processed.

*  History:
*     1988 September 22 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1989 July 28 (MJC):
*        Added extra argument CARD.
*     1990 November 19 (MJC):
*        Renamed from FTS1_GKEY, and converted the prologue to the SST
*        style.
*     1991 February 28 (MJC):
*        Converted BUFFER from an assumed-size to an adjustable array
*        via the NCARD argument in case the END keyword is missing.
*     1991 July 14 (MJC):
*        Modified to handle hierarchical keywords.
*     1991 August 31 (MJC):
*        Fixed bug in comparing card keyword with the selected keyword.
*     1996 July 25 (MJC):
*        Allow for values that extending beyond column 30.
*     1996 November 1 (MJC):
*        Reintegrated some of PDRAPER's changes made to create
*        IMG1_GKEYx, notably the ability to deal with keywords with
*        more than one occurrence, and "beefed up" error reports.
*     1996 November 14 (MJC):
*        Added COMENT argument.
