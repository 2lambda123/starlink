      SUBROUTINE FTS1_BSWAP( NBYTE, BYTES, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_BSWAP

*  Purpose:
*     Swaps adjacent bytes in an array of bytes.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_BSWAP( NBYTE, BYTES, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This swaps adjacent pairs of bytes in an array in situ.  This is
*     VAX specific.

*  Arguments:
*     NBYTE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of bytes.  An SAI__ERROR will be returned if this is not
*        an even number.
*     BYTES( NBYTE ) = BYTE (Given and Returned)
*        The 16-bit words whose bytes are to be swapped.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
