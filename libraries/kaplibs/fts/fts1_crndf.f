*  Name:
*     FTS1_CRNDF

*  Purpose:
*     For a FITS data array create an NDF, generating the NDF's name in
*     some circumstances.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_CRNDF( PNNDF, FILROO, GCOUNT, NG, AUTO, FORMAT, NDIM,
*    :                 DIMS, NDF, FILNAM, ASSOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This is a server routine for FITSIN.  It packages up the
*     operations required to create an output NDF.  In automatic mode
*     the filename is generated and put into the parameter to prevent
*     prompting.  In manual mode the user is prompted for the file
*     name of the NDF.

*  Arguments:
*     PNNDF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter by which the filename of the output
*        NDF will be obtained.
*     FILROO = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The rootname of the output NDF.  The suffix Gn, where n=%NG, is
*        appended in group-format mode to generate the filename.
*        Otherwise in automatic mode the NDF filename is the rootname.
*     GCOUNT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of data arrays in the FITS sub-file.  It should be one
*        if there are no groups.
*     NG = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of the group.  It should be one if there are no groups.
*     AUTO = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true the processing should be done in automatic mode, where
*        the user is not prompted for file names, since these are
*        generated from the prefix, file and sub-file numbers.
*     FORMAT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The destination HDS format of the data array in the output
*        file.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimensionality of the NDF.
*     DIMS( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensions of the NDF.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The identifier of the created NDF.
*     FILNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The filename of the output NDF.
*     ASSOC = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If false the NDF name was generated automatically.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
