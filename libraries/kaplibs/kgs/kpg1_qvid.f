      SUBROUTINE KPG1_QVID( PNDEV, PKG, CLASS, CRITER, MININT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_QVID

*  Purpose:
*     Tests whether the current graphics device has suitable
*     image-display characteristics.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_QVID( PNDEV, PKG, CLASS, CRITER, MININT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines whether the current graphics device is an
*     image display with suitable characteristics.  The checks are
*     performed in the following order: the class of the device is
*     checked against a supplied list of acceptable classes; the
*     presence of certain attributes, given in a supplied list are
*     checked in the order colour, input and open with reset; and
*     finally a minimum number of colour indices must be exceeded.

*  Arguments:
*     PNDEV = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The ADAM parameter associated with the current graphics
*        workstation.  It is used to generate error messages.
*     PKG = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The graphics system.  It must be 'SGS' or 'GKS'.
*     CLASS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A list of acceptable workstation classes as defined by GNS,
*        each separated by a comma.  See SUN/57 for a list.
*     CRITER = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A list of criteria that the workstation must pass in order to
*        be an acceptable image display.  The options are: 'COLOUR' if
*        colour must be available, 'CURSOR' if a cursor must be
*        available on the workstation, 'INPUT' if the workstation must
*        support input, and 'RESET' if the workstation must be capable
*        of being opened without reset.  Non-standard criteria will be
*        ignored.
*     MININT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Minimum number of intensities or colour indices required.  The
*        routine ensures that there are at least the reserved number
*        plus eight, except for workstations in the WINDOW_OVERLAY
*        class, when 1 is the minimum.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  An SGS workstation must be open.

*  History:
*     1991 May 10 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1991 July 5 (MJC):
*        Added cursor availability to the list of criteria.  Made to
*        test all criteria even if one has already not been achieved.
*     1992 June 16 (MJC):
*        Removed the constraint that the minimum number of colours
*        indices is the size of the palette.  Set minimum at 1 for
*        the WINDOW_OVERLAY class of device.
