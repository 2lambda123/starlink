      SUBROUTINE KPG1_IVCI( PNDEV, PNCOL, RESERV, CI, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_IVCI

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a valid colour index.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_IVCI( PNDEV, PNCOL, RESERV, CI, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This obtains a valid colour index for a device.  By using the
*     characteristics of the device sensible limits for the unreserved
*     indices can be determined, and if the device is a workstation
*     overlay or colour is unavailable, the colour index is defined to
*     be 1.  In the former case, the unreserved or reserved colour
*     index limits are supplied to KPG1_MACOL which lets the value be
*     the minimum or maximum unreserved or reserved colour index,
*     a named colour in the palette, or any numbered colour index.

*  Arguments:
*     PNDEV = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter name used to open the graphics device.
*     PNCOL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter name for the colour.
*     RESERV = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether or not the limits for MIN and MAX values in KPG1_MACOL
*        are restricted to the palette (.TRUE.) or the unreserved pens
*        (.FALSE.).
*     CI = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The colour index to use.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     A GKS workstation must already be open.
