      SUBROUTINE KPG1_QNCOL( NUMENT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_QNCOL

*  Purpose:
*     Inquires the number of intensity-table entries of the current
*     graphics device.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_QNCOL( NUMENT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines how many "colour table" entries or
*     intensities the current GKS graphics device has.  This includes
*     devices that do not support colour.

*  Arguments:
*     NUMENT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of entries in the intensity table.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  An SGS workstation must be open.
