      SUBROUTINE DREBAR( X, Y, ERROR, NPTS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DREBAR

*  Purpose:
*     Draws a series of error bars over an AUTOGRAPH background.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DREBAR( X, Y, ERROR, NPTS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Draws a diamond centred on each point, then draws a vertical
*     line through the diamond. It assumes that the current SGS zone on
*     entry covers the AUTOGRAPH grid window and has world coordinates
*     corresponding to user coordinates.

*  Arguments:
*     X( NPTS ) = REAL (Given)
*        The x coordinate of the centre of each error bar, given in user
*        x coordinates.
*     Y( NPTS ) = REAL (Given)
*        The y coordinate of the centre of each error bar, given in user
*        y coordinates.
*     ERROR( NPTS ) = REAL (Given)
*        The length of each error bar, given in user y coordinates.
*     NPTS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of error bars to plot.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status.
