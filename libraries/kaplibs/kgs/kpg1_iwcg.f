*     KPG1_IWCG

*  Purpose:
*     Inquires a characteristic of a GKS device.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_IWCG( WKCHAR, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This inquiries a characteristic of the current GKS graphics
*     workstation by accessing GNS.

*  Arguments:
*     WKCHAR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the characteristic.  See SUN/57 for a full list.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( GNS__SZKEY ) (Returned)
*        The value of the specified characteristic for the current
*        workstation.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
