      SUBROUTINE KPG1_GCA( PX, PY, QX, QY, NX, NY, LX, LY, KCOLA,
     :                     STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_GCA

*  Purpose:
*     Plots a cell array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_GCA( PX, PX, QX, QY, NX, NY, LX, LY, KCOLA, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This uses GKS to plot a cell array.  It is needed as an interface
*     procedure for GKS 7.2 and 7.4 GCA usage, since these have
*     different argument lists.  This is the GKS 7.4 version.

*  Arguments:
*     PX = REAL (Given)
*        X world co-ordinate of lower-left corner of the cell array.
*     PY = REAL (Given)
*        Y world co-ordinate of lower-left corner of the cell array.
*     QX = REAL (Given)
*        X world co-ordinate of upper-right corner of the cell array.
*     QY = REAL (Given)
*        Y world co-ordinate of upper-right corner of the cell array.
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of columns in the cell array.
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lines in the cell array.
*     LX = INTEGER (Given)
*        X dimension of the cell array.
*     LY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Y dimension of the cell array.
*     KCOLA( LX, LY ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The array of colour indices.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  GKS must be in state WSAC or SGOP.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is no validation by this routine of the input arguments
*     as they are passed directly to GCA.
