*  Name:
*     KPG1_ZOPIC

*  Purpose:
*     Creates zones required to produce a plot with key and axes.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ZOPIC( PNXSIZ, PNYSIZ, COMMNT, ASPKEY, XLO, XHI, YLO, 
*                      YHI, KEY, AXES, ZONEF, ZONED, ZONEK, ZONEG, 
*                      PICIDF, XM, YM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates the zones required for the various parts of a plot
*     (FRAME, KEY, DATA and graph window).  If a DATA picture is
*     contained within the current picture then it is used to define
*     the zone in which to produce the data plot.  In this case, the
*     bounds of the displayed DATA picture (in pixel co-ordinates) are
*     returned in SXLO, etc.  Otherwise, the user is asked for a FRAME
*     picture size and the DATA picture is created within it using the
*     supplied values of SXLO, etc.  The current zone is unchanged on
*     exit.  A picture corresponding to the new FRAME zone is stored in
*     the AGI database.

*  Arguments:
*     PNXSIZ = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter to use when obtaining the x size of
*        a FRAME picture.  Only used if the current picture does not
*        contain a DATA picture.
*     PNXSIZ = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter to use when obtaining the y size of
*        a FRAME picture.  Only used if the current picture does not
*        contain a DATA picture.
*     COMMNT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A comment to store with the new FRAME picture. 
*     ASPKEY = REAL (Given)
*        The aspect ratio required for the KEY zone.
*     XLO = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        On entry: The lower x bound of the data array available for
*        plotting, in pixel co-ordinates.
*        On exit: The returned value depends on whether or not a DATA
*        picture was found within the current picture.  If a DATA
*        picture was found, the returned value is the lower x bound of
*        the DATA picture.  Otherwise the returned value is equal to
*        the supplied value.
*     XHI = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The upper x bound of the DATA zone.  See XLO.
*     YLO = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The lower y bound of the DATA zone.  See XLO.
*     YHI = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The upper y bound of the DATA zone.  See XLO.
*     KEY = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        On entry: whether or not a key has been requested.
*        On exit: set .FALSE. if a key was requested but there is
*        insufficient room within the current zone to produce one.  A
*        warning message is issued if this occurs.  Otherwise it
*        retains its value on entry.
*     AXES = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        On entry: whether or not annotated axes have been requested.
*        On exit: set .FALSE. if annotated axes were requested but
*        there is insufficient room within the current zone to produce
*        them.  A warning message is issued if this occurs.  Otherwise
*        it retains its value on entry.
*     ZONEF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifier for the FRAME zone.
*     ZONED = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifier for the DATA zone.
*     ZONEK = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifier for the KEY zone.  Returned set to zero if KEY is
*        returned .FALSE..
*     ZONEG = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifier for the graph window zone.  Returned set to zero if
*        AXES is returned .FALSE..
*     PICIDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        AGI identifier for the FRAME picture.
*     XM = REAL (Returned)
*        The physical x dimension of the DATA zone in metres.
*     YM = REAL (Returned)
*        The physical y dimension of the DATA zone in metres.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
