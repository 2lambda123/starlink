      SUBROUTINE KPG1_QCOL( COLOUR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_QCOL

*  Purpose:
*     Tests whether the current graphics device supports colour.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_QCOL( COLOUR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines whether the current GKS graphics device
*     supports colour.

*  Arguments:
*     COLOUR = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true the device supports colour.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  An SGS workstation must be open.

*    Get the workstation type.

      CALL GQWKC( WKID, GSTAT, CONID, WSTYPE )

*    Inquire whether GKS/SGS has reported an error.

*    Inquire whether GKS has reported an error.

      CALL GKS_GSTAT( STATUS )

*    Convert from a numerical flag.
