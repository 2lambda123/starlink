*+  CURPTS - define points in an image via the cursor

      SUBROUTINE CURPTS( NPTS, EXACT, MAXCHO, MARK, ERASE, CROSHT,
     :                   CONECT, DSTNCT, XLOW, XHIGH, YLOW, YHIGH,
     :                   XCUR, YCUR, NOBT, X, Y, STATUS )
*
*    Description :
*
*     This subroutine enables use of the cursor of the current graphics 
*     device to select a defined number of points whose co-ordinates are
*     returned.  Only positions between defined limits are accepted.
*     Optionally a cross may be drawn at each point, and each point may
*     be forced to be distinct.  Also lines may be drawn connecting
*     successive points.
*
*    Invocation :
*
*      CALL CURPTS( NPTS, EXACT, MAXCHO, MARK, ERASE, CROSHT, CONECT,
*    :              DSTNCT, XLOW, XHIGH, YLOW, YHIGH, XCUR, YCUR, NOBT,
*    :              X, Y, STATUS )
*
*    Arguments :
*
*     NPTS = INTEGER( READ )
*         Number of points to be determined with the cursor.
*     EXACT = LOGICAL( READ )
*         True if exactly %NPTS are required.  This just changes the
*           commentary.  It is ignored when only one point is required.
*     MAXCHO = INTEGER( READ )
*         Maximum choice number for the choice to be a valid selection.
*           A choice with a higher value than this cause this routine to
*           end.
*     MARK = LOGICAL( READ )
*         True if each point selected is marked with a cross.
*     ERASE = LOGICAL( READ )
*         True if each marked point is erased upon completion.  It is
*           ignored unless %MARK is true.  This may not work on some
*           devices.
*     CROSHT = REAL( READ )
*         Height of the marking cross.
*     CONECT = LOGICAL( READ )
*         True if successive points are connected by straight lines.
*     DSTNCT = LOGICAL( READ )
*         True if each point selected is to be distinct.
*     XLOW = REAL( READ )
*         Lower x co-ordinate that defines the region in which all
*           points selected by the cursor must lie.
*     XHIGH = REAL( READ )
*         Upper x co-ordinate that defines the region in which all
*           points selected by the cursor must lie.
*     YLOW = REAL( READ )
*         Lower y co-ordinate that defines the region in which all
*           points selected by the cursor must lie.
*     YHIGH = REAL( READ )
*         Upper y co-ordinate that defines the region in which all
*           points selected by the cursor must lie.
*     XCUR = REAL( READ )
*         X co-ordinate of the position where the cursor will first
*           appear. This is usually the last location of the cursor
*           or the centre of the picture.
*     YCUR = REAL( READ )
*         Y co-ordinate of the position where the cursor will first
*           appear
*     NOBT = INTEGER( WRITE )
*         Number of points obtained with the cursor. This is usually
*           the same as %NPTS, but should be tested in case there
*           has been an error or a premature exit.
*     X( NPTS ) = REAL( WRITE )
*         The x co-ordinates of the points measured by the cursor.
*     Y( NPTS ) = REAL( WRITE )
*         The y co-ordinates of the points measured by the cursor.
*     STATUS  = INTEGER( READ, WRITE )
*         Global status value
*
*    Method :
*
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     Inform the user what is expected depending on the number of
*       points, whether or not an exact number required, whether or not
*       distinct points required
*     If points are to be marked then
*        Store current pen number
*        If marked points are to be erased then
*           Store a current polyline representation
*           Replace it with the background colour
*        Endif
*     Endif
*     Repeat until the required number of positions have been chosen or 
*       an exit button has been depressed or there is an error
*        Repeat until a valid position has been chosen or an exit button
*             has been pressed or there is an error
*           Set cursor to the last position
*           Obtain a cursor position
*           If the button pressed was to accept the position then
*              If it lies within the defined region then
*              Reset last cursor position to its current position
*              If distinct points required and this is not the first
*                position then
*                 Check that the point is new
*              Endif
*              If there is no duplication (when distinct points are
*                required) then
*                 Increment count of points chosen
*                 Store the point in the output arrays
*                 Connect to the previous point with a straight line if
*                   required
*                 Mark with a cross (green on colour devices) if
*                   required
*                 Set repeat switch to off
*              Endif
*           Else
*              Set repeat switch to off
*           Endif
*        Enddo
*     Enddo
*     If points were marked then
*        If marked points are to be erased then
*           Mark the crosses again, but with the background pen
*           Restore input polyline representation
*        Endif
*        Restore input pen number

*    History :
*
*     1989 Nov 10: Original (RAL::CUR).
*     1990 Feb 1 : Added optional lines between points, accidently
*                  omitted in the original (RAL::CUR).
*     1990 May 2 : Added EXACT and ERASE arguments and functionality
*                  (RAL::CUR).
*     1991 Mar 13: Used aspect source flags set to individual to erase
*                  crosses, rather than set polyline representation
*                  (RAL::CUR).
*     1993 Nov 10: Made erasure dependent on the ERASE argument.
*                  (RAL::CUR).
*     1993 Dec  6: Fixed bug that could give an incorrection rejection
*                  of distinct points when x or y positions were the
*                  the same. (RAL::CUR).
