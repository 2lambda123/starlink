      SUBROUTINE KPG1_SDTRN( LABEL, NDF, PICID, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_SDTRN

*  Purpose:
*     Saves the current SGS zone as a data picture and a reference to
*     the data object that was used to create it.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_SDTRN( LABEL, NDF, PICID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine takes the current zone and saves it with the
*     specified label into the graphics database.  A data object that
*     was used to generate the picture is stored by reference in the
*     database, associated with the data picture.

*  Arguments:
*     LABEL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The label for the data picture.
*     NDF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The NDF identifier of the data object.
*     PICID = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The picture identifier of the data picture.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The AGI SGS interface must be active.
*     -  The data object give by the parameter name should still be
*     associated to prevent reprompting.

*        Original version.
*     1996 March 18 (MJC):
*        Obtains name of the NDF using NDF identifier rather than an
*        HDS locator.  This lets sections to be passed.  The PNDATA
*        argument was changed to become the identifier of the NDF
*        (usually being the one obtained through the PNDATA parameter).
*        Used modern-style coding.

*  Obtain the name and section of the NDF as a string, by first making
*  a message token.

*  Put the literal reference into the database for the current picture.
