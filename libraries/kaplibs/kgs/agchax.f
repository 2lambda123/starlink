      SUBROUTINE AGCHAX( IFLG, IAXS, IPRT, VILS )
*+
*  Name:
*     AGCHAX

*  Purpose:
*     Set pen number for axes of an NCAR (AUTOGRAPH) display.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGCHAX( IFLG, IAXS, IPRT, VILS )

*  Description:
*     This is a user version of AGCHAX to replace the one in NCAR 
*     library. It is used, together with the routine IRM_STPEN, to set
*     the pen number for the axis lines, tick marks and numeric labels 
*     of an NCAR (AUTOGRPH) display. It is not called directly by the 
*     user program, but by AUTOGRAPH itself, just before and just after 
*     each of the objects making up an axis is drawn. This routine will
*     set the pen number for each axis portion according to the values 
*     of the NCAR pen setting variables in the common block IRM_COM 
*     which are set by IRM_STPEN.

*     To use this routine, it must be linked explicitly with the user
*     program to override the default version of AGCHAX in NCAR library.

*  Arguments:
*     See section 3.23.2 of AUTOGRAPH document.
