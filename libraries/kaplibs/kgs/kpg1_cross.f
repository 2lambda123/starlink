      SUBROUTINE KPG1_CROSS( X, Y, SIZE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_CROSS 

*  Purpose:
*     Draws a cross at the specified pixel position.

*  Description:
*     This routine accepts the co-ordinates of a point and draws a
*     cross of defined size centred at that point.  The SGS buffers
*     are flushed after the cross is drawn.
*
*     An SGS device must already be open.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_CROSS( X, Y, SIZE, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     X = REAL( READ )
*         The X co-ordinate of the point.
*     Y = REAL( READ )
*         The Y co-ordinate of the point.
*     SIZE = REAL( READ )
*         The width and height of the cross in pixels
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ )
*         The status on entry to this subroutine.

*  Method:
*     The co-ordinates of the ends of the arms of the cross are
*     calculated, then the cross is plotted.

*  History:
*     26 October 1983:  Original
*     1986 Sep 17 : Renamed from KFH_CROSS. Standardised to RAPI2D
*                   style; renamed parameters section to arguments and
*                   added access; relocated 'local' variables to
*                   import etc.; and tidied (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1988 Sep 12 : Added SIZE argument and fixed typing bug
*                   (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1991 Jun 18 : Renamed from CROSS (RAL::CUR).

     :  LX,                    ! X co-ordinate - left arm of the cross
     :  RX,                    ! X co-ordinate - right arm of the cross
     :  TY,                    ! Y co-ordinate - upper arm of the cross
     :  BY                     ! Y co-ordinate - lower arm of the cross

*    If the status is bad on entry, then return to the main program.

      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

      HSIZ = 0.5 * SIZE

*    Calculate the extent of the cross.

      LX = X - HSIZ
      RX = X + HSIZ
      TY = Y + HSIZ
      BY = Y - HSIZ

*    Plot the cross...

      CALL SGS_LINE( LX, Y, RX, Y )
      CALL SGS_LINE( X, TY, X, BY )

*    ... now

      CALL SGS_FLUSH
