      SUBROUTINE IRQ_ADDQN( LOCS, QNAME, DEFLT, COMMNT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_ADDQN

*  Purpose:
*     Define a new quality name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_ADDQN( LOCS, QNAME, DEFLT, COMMNT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine adds the quality name specified by QNAME to the NDF
*     specified by LOCS. LOCS must previously have been assigned values
*     by one of the routines IRQ_FIND or IRQ_NEW. If the quality name
*     is already defined, an error is reported. Note, this routine does
*     not reserve a bit in the QUALITY component for the new quality
*     name, it mearly established a default value for the quality which
*     will be used for all pixels in the NDF if no subsequent call to
*     IRQ_SETQC is made. Note, the string ANY cannot be used as a
*     quality name. Also, quality names may not contain any full stops.
*
*     An error is reported if only READ access is available to the NDF.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS(5) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An array of 5 HDS locators. These locators identify the NDF
*        and the associated quality name information.  They should have
*        been obtained using routine IRQ_FIND or routine IRQ_NEW.
*     QNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The new quality name to store. The maximum length of this
*        string is given by symbolic constant IRQ__SZQNM which currently
*        has the value 15. Leading spaces are ignored, and the stored
*        name is converted to upper case.
*     DEFLT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then by default all pixels are assumed to hold the
*        quality specified by QNAME. If false, then it is assumed that
*        no pixels hold the quality.
*     COMMNT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A descriptive comment to store with the quality name. The
*        maximum length of this string is given by symbolic constant
*        IRQ__SZCOM, which currently has the value 50. Any characters
*        beyond this length are ignored.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
