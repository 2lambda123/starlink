      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_RESET( LOCS, SLOT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_RESET

*  Purpose:
*     Reset a slot in the QUAL structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_RESET( LOCS, SLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The specified slot of the QUAL array is reset, i.e. any
*     association with a quality name is annulled. The slot can then be
*     re-used for a new quality name.  The number of free slots
*     (located by LOCS(4) ) is incremented, and the slot number added
*     to the list of free slots (located by LOCS(5) ).

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS( 5 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A set of 5 HDS locators. LOCS( 1 ) locates a temporary
*        structure holding a cloned NDF identifier. LOCS(2) locates the
*        QUAL array. LOCS(3) locates the LAST_USED value, holding the
*        index of the last used slot in the QUAL array. LOCS(4) locates
*        the NFREE value, holding the number of free slots in the QUAL
*        array. LOCS(5) locates the FREE array, which contains a stack
*        of the NFREE slot indices corresponding to free slots. This
*        stack is accessed in a "First-In-Last-Out" method.
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the slot to be reset.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
