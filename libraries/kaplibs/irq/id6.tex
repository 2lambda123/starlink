\section {Introduction to QUALITY}
A QUALITY structure is one of the standard components of an NDF structure, and
is described fully in SUN/33. Briefly, if an NDF has a QUALITY component which
is in a {\em defined} state, then each pixel within the NDF DATA component has a
corresponding value in the QUALITY component. Currently, each QUALITY value
consists of an unsigned byte (i.e. 8 bits). In Fortran the least significant bit
is usually called bit 0 and the most significant bit is usually called bit 7.
Within the IRQ package the least significant bit is called bit 1 and the most
significant bit is called bit 8. Each bit within the QUALITY value can be used
to indicate if the corresponding pixel in the DATA component holds some specific
{\em quality}. For instance, bit 3 of the QUALITY component may be used to
indicate if any DATA pixels are saturated. A particular pixel in the QUALITY
component would have bit 3 set (i.e. equal to 1) if the corresponding DATA pixel
is saturated, or cleared (i.e. equal to 0) if the corresponding DATA pixel is
not saturated. 

Another option for flagging saturated data is to replace saturated DATA pixel
values with a ``bad'' (or ``magic'') value. This has the disadvantage that the
data is permanently destroyed by being flagged, and also there is no distinction
between data values which are set bad because of the fact they were saturated,
and pixels set bad for any other reason. 

SUN/33 doesn't specify how the facilities of the QUALITY component are to be 
used, and many possibilities exist. Obviously some coordination between 
applications is needed so that different applications interpret the QUALITY 
values in a consistent manner (i.e. using the above example, later applications
must know that bit 3 is a saturation flag). The IRQ package provides a set of
routines for doing this.

\section {Introduction to the facilities provided by the IRQ package}
\label {SEC:IRQ}
IRQ provides a system for handling Boolean qualities (i.e. qualities which are
either held or not held by each DATA pixel) on either VMS or UNIX systems. From
the point of view of an application, each defined quality is identified by a
{\em quality name} rather than by a bit number. Information about these quality
names is stored in an NDF extension, so that later applications can determine
which pixels within the NDF hold a given quality (or combination of qualities). 

Within IRQ, each defined quality name is usually associated with a bit in the
QUALITY array, and this bit is set if the corresponding DATA pixels are assigned
the specified quality. A typical application need know nothing about which
QUALITY bit is associated with which quality name. For instance, if {\em every}
pixel in an NDF holds a certain quality (or alternatively, if {\em no} pixels
hold the quality), then it is not necessary to reserve a bit in the QUALITY
array to represent the quality. Instead, a single Boolean scalar value can be
stored with the quality name in the NDF extension. This scalar is set to .TRUE.
if {\em all} pixels hold the quality, and .FALSE. if {\em no} pixels hold the
quality. In this way, the number of defined quality names can sometimes exceed
the number of bits in the QUALITY component. The handling of such situations is
done within IRQ and is completely invisible to the calling application. 

IRQ provides facilities to 
\begin{itemize}
\item Add quality name definitions (and associated descriptive comments) to an
NDF. There is a limit to the number of quality names which may be defined within
an NDF. The exact number depends on how many quality names require a QUALITY
bit, but it will always be at least 8. 
\item Remove quality name definitions from an NDF.
\item List all quality names defined within an NDF.
\item Assign a given quality to selected pixels.
\item Remove a given quality from selected pixels.
\item Set ``bad'' those pixels of a supplied array which hold a certain 
combination of qualities.
\end{itemize}

\section {A Set of Four Typical IRQ Applications}
The IRAS90 package contains a set of four typical IRQ applications, which give
an indication of the benefits which IRQ can provide for the user. The ATASK
documentation for these four applications is included in appendix
\ref{APP:APPS}, and they are briefly described in this section. 
\subsection{SETQUAL}
SETQUAL creates quality name definitions and stores them within a specified
extension of an NDF. It also assigns a specified quality to a sub-set of the
pixels with the NDF. In its simplest mode, the user provides an NDF, and a
string to use as a quality name (eg ``SATURATED''). If this quality name is not
already defined within the NDF, then it is added to the list of defined quality
names, together with a user-supplied comment describing the quality. The user
also provides another NDF to be used as a ``mask''. The ``bad'' pixels within
the mask NDF define the pixels which are to be assigned the given quality. For
instance, a user may have an image containing saturated pixels. If he wants
these pixels flagged without being permanently destroyed, he could proceed as
follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Produce a mask NDF from the original NDF by setting all DATA pixels 
above the saturation value to the ``bad'' value. 
\item Run SETQUAL on the original NDF, giving some quality name such as
``SATURATED'', and specifying the mask created in the previous step. This leaves
the DATA component of the original NDF unchanged, but assigns the quality
``SATURATED'' to all the pixels which correspond to ``bad'' pixels in the mask. 
\end{enumerate}
Alternatively, instead of using a mask, the pixels to which the quality is
assigned may be specified by an explicit list of pixel indices stored in a
text file.

\subsection{REMQUAL}
The REMQUAL application removes quality name definitions from an NDF. This may be
necessary if there is no room for any more quality name definitions within an
NDF. In this case the user may choose to remove some unimportant quality name
definitions to make room for new, more important quality names. REMQUAL can also
remove {\em all} quality names information from an NDF. This can be useful if
for any reason the quality name information becomes corrupted. 

\subsection{SHOWQUAL}
The SHOWQUAL application displays all currently defined quality names within an
NDF together with the associated descriptive comments. Optionally, the number of
pixels which hold each quality can be displayed. 

\subsection{QUALTOBAD}
The QUALTOBAD application sets selected pixels within an NDF to the ``bad''
value on the basis of the pixel's quality. In effect, QUALTOBAD performs the
reverse operation of SETQUAL. For instance, using the example of saturated data
described above, the user may remove some varying background surface from his
original data, and then want to set pixels which were saturated in the original
data to the ``bad'' value . In this case he would run QUALTOBAD specifying the
background removed NDF as input, and specifying a {\em quality expression} of
``SATURATED''. This would cause all pixels which hold the quality ``SATURATED''
to be set bad in the output NDF. 

The ``quality expression'' can be more complex than a single quality name. In 
fact, a quality expression can consist of several quality names combined 
together using the usual operators of Boolean algebra. For instance, if the
quality expression ``SATURATED.AND..NOT.(SOURCE\_A .OR. SOURCE\_B)'' was given to 
QUALTOBAD, then pixels would be set ``bad'' only if they had the quality 
SATURATED, but did not have either of the qualities SOURCE\_A or SOURCE\_B.

\section{Quality Names}
A quality name must contain 15 or less characters. Any leading blanks are
removed from supplied quality names, and they are converted to upper case before
being stored in the NDF. Quality names may contain embedded blanks, but may not 
contain full-stop (".") characters. Certain names are reserved and may not be 
used. These are ``ANY'', ``IRQ\_BAD\_SLOT'' and ``IRQ\_FREE\_SLOT''.

\section{Quality Expressions}
A ``Quality Expression'' consists of a set of quality names combined together
using Boolean operators into a legal Boolean expression. See section \ref
{SEC:QEXP} for a description of the use of quality expressions within IRQ. In
the following, the symbols ``A'' and ``B'' are used to represent two qualities.
These can be considered as Boolean values; ``true'' if a pixel holds the
quality, and ``false'' otherwise. The supported Boolean operators are: 
\begin {description}
\item [.AND.] - The expression (A.AND.B) is true if and only if both A and B are
true. 
\item [.OR.] - The expression (A.OR.B) is true if and only if either A or B is
true. 
\item [.XOR.] - The expression (A.XOR.B) is true if and only if either A is
true and B is false, or A is false and B is true.
\item [.EQV.] - The expression (A.EQV.B) is true if and only if either A is
true and B is true, or A is false and B is false.
\item [.NOT.] - The expression (.NOT.A) is true if and only if A is false.
\end{description}
In addition to the above operators, the Boolean constants .FALSE. and .TRUE. can
be included within a quality expression. Expressions may contain several levels
of nested parentheses. 

The precedence of these operators decreases in the following order; .NOT.,
.AND., .OR., .XOR., .EQV. (the final two have equal precedence). In an
expression such as (A.XOR.B.EQV.C.XOR.D) in which all operators have equal
precedence, the evaluation proceeds from left to right., i.e. the expression is
evaluated as  (((A.XOR.B).EQV.C).XOR.D). If there is any doubt about the order 
in which an expression will be evaluated, parentheses should be used to ensure 
the required order of evaluation.

Some attempts are made to simplify a quality expression to reduce the run time
needed to evaluate the expression for every pixel. 

Quality expressions can be up to 254 characters long, and must not contain more 
than 40 symbols (Boolean operators, constants, or quality names).


\section {Using IRQ routines}
This section gives a brief outline of the IRQ routines which are available to 
perform some common tasks. The specific details required to use these routines 
are not included here but can be found in the subroutine specifications 
contained in appendix \ref {SEC:FULLSPEC}.

\subsection {Constants and Error Values}
\label {SEC:CON}
The IRQ package has associated with it various symbolic constants. These values
consist of a name of up to 5 characters prefixed by ``IRQ\_\_''  (note the {\em
double} underscore), and can be made available to an application by including
the following line at the start of the routines which uses them: 

\begin{verbatim}
      INCLUDE 'IRQ_PAR'
\end{verbatim}

This assumes that the IRAS90 package has been installed as part
of the UNIX Starlink Software Collection. If this is not the case, then the
alternative instructions given in appendix /ref {APP:NOSTAR} should be followed.

The values thus defined are described in the following sections, and also in the
subroutine specifications. Another set of symbolic constants is made available
by the statements 

\begin{verbatim}
      INCLUDE 'IRQ_ERR'
\end{verbatim}

These values have the same format of those contained in IRQ\_PAR, put define
various error conditions which can be generated within the IRQ package.
Applications can compare the $STATUS$ argument with these values to check for
specific error conditions. These values are described in appendix \ref
{APP:ERRORS}. 

\subsection{Initialising an NDF for use with IRQ}
Certain HDS structures must be created within an NDF before the NDF can be used
by IRQ. These structures hold information describing the currently defined
quality names within the NDF. Routine IRQ\_FIND can be used to see if such
structures exist within an NDF (see below). If no such structure yet exists
within an NDF, routine IRQ\_NEW must be called to create the structure. This
structure is held in a specified NDF extension. IRQ\_NEW returns an array of HDS
locators which must be passed to subsequent IRQ routines. One of these locators
points to a cloned copy of the NDF identifier. All access to the NDF by
subsequent IRQ routines is achieved through this cloned identifier. Once access
to the quality names information is no longer required, the resources used by
these HDS locators (including the cloned NDF identifier) should be annulled by
calling IRQ\_RLSE. Note, routines IRQ\_ANNUL and IRQ\_CLOSE play no part in
releasing resources used for accessing quality name information. These two
routines are only used for releasing resources used to store {\em compiled
quality expressions} (see section /ref {SEC:QEXP}). IRQ\_RLSE is the only
routine which needs to be called to release resources used for accessing {\em
quality names}. 

\subsection{Using previously initialised NDFs within IRQ}
If the NDF has been initialised for use by IRQ, then the structure holding the
quality names information must be found before other IRQ routines can be called.
Routine IRQ\_FIND does this. This routine looks through all the NDF extensions
until a suitable structure is found. If no such structure is found the status
value IRQ\_\_NOQNI is returned. If more than one extension contains such a
structure, then the status value IRQ\_\_MULT is returned. If the routine runs
successfully, then an array of HDS locators is returned similar to the array
returned by IRQ\_NEW. Once access to the quality names information is no longer
required, the resources used by these HDS locators (including the cloned
NDF identifier) should be annulled by calling IRQ\_RLSE. 

\subsection{Accessing the quality names information stored in an NDF}
To access the quality names information stored within an NDF, a set of HDS 
locators to the information must first be obtained by calling either IRQ\_NEW or 
IRQ\_FIND (see above). Once this has been done the information can be read, 
modified, or added to. IRQ\_ADDQN adds a new quality name definition to an NDF 
(so long as there is room for it within the structures and the QUALITY 
component). IRQ\_CHKQN checks to see if a given name is defined. IRQ\_GETQN 
searches for a specified quality name, and 
returns various items of information about it (such as which bit of the QUALITY 
component it is assigned to). IRQ\_NUMQN returns the number of defined quality 
names. IRQ\_NXTQN returns the next defined quality name. Repeated calls to 
IRQ\_NXTQN can be made to get a list of all the quality names defined within an 
NDF. IRQ\_REMQN removes the definition of a quality name from an NDF.

\subsection{Assigning and removing qualities to and from NDF pixels}
Once quality names have been defined, they can be assigned to selected pixels
within the NDF. There are two ways of specifying which pixels are ``selected''.
Routine IRQ\_SETQM requires a mask image to be provided in which the ``bad''
pixels define the pixels in the NDF DATA component to which the quality is to be
assigned. Routine IRQ\_SETQL requires a list of pixel indices to be provided
which defines the pixels in the NDF DATA component to which the quality is to be
assigned. The quality of the NDF pixels which are {\em not} selected is left
unchanged. Thus, if an unselected pixel already has the specified quality, these
routines will not {\em remove} the quality from those pixels. 

The routines IRQ\_RESQM and IRQ\_RESQL, are complimentary to IRQ\_SETQM and 
IRQ\_SETQL. Instead of ensuring that the selected pixels hold the specified
quality, these routines ensure that the selected pixels {\em do not} hold the 
specified quality. Again, the quality of unselected pixels is left unchanged.

Routine IRQ\_SETQ ensures that {\em all} pixels in an NDF have a specified
quality, and routine IRQ\_RESQ ensures that {\em no} pixels in an NDF have a
specified quality. 

The routine IRQ\_CNTQ will count the number of bits set in each bit plane in the
QUALITY component. 

\subsection{Finding NDF pixels which satisfy a quality expression}
\label {SEC:QEXP}
If a subset of pixels are to be operated on by an application, the application
will usually obtain a quality expression from the user which defines the pixels
to be operated on. That is to say, pixels which have qualities which do not
satisfy the quality expression would not usually be used by the application. The
quality expression is usually obtained from the user using the ADAM parameter
system. It is then passed to IRQ\_COMP to be compiled. If any problems are
detected with the expression (such as syntax errors, or undefined quality names)
IRQ\_COMP will report an error, and it is then up to the applications to decide 
what to do. Typically, it will flush the error, and reprompt the user for a new
quality expression. The routine IRQ\_SYNTX will check a quality expression for 
syntax errors without actually compiling it or checking that the referenced 
quality names are defined.

If IRQ\_COMP successfully compiles the quality expression, it returns an
identifier for the compiled quality expression. This identifier is actually a
pointer to a temporary HDS structure holding information about the quality
expression. The identifier is passed to IRQ\_SBAD which locates all NDF pixels
which have qualities which satisfy the quality expression. The corresponding
pixels in an array supplied to IRQ\_SBAD are set ``bad''. The other pixels are
left unchanged. Alternatively, pixels with qualities which {\em do not} satisfy
the quality expression can be set bad in the supplied array. Note, the array
supplied to IRQ\_SBAD must be the same shape and size as the NDF supplied to
IRQ\_FIND or IRQ\_NEW. If an NDF section was used, then the array supplied to
IRQ\_SBAD must be the same shape and size as the NDF section, {\em not} the base
NDF. 

Up to ten compiled quality expressions can be active at once. The identifiers
for each compiled quality expression should be annuled when it is no longer
needed by calling IRQ\_ANNUL. IRQ\_CLOSE should be called when all compiled 
quality expressions have been finished with. 

\section {Compiling and Linking with IRQ}
\label{SEC:LINK}
This section describes how to compile and link applications which use IRQ
subroutines, on both VMS and UNIX systems. It is assumed that the IRAS90 package
is installed as part of the Starlink Software Collection.

\subsection{VMS}
Each terminal session which is to include the compilation or linking of 
applications which use the IRQ package should start by issuing the commands:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ADAMSTART
$ ADAMDEV
$ IRAS90
$ IRAS90_DEV
\end{verbatim}

These commands set up logical names related to all the IRAS90
subsystems, including IRQ. 

To link a VMS ADAM application with the IRQ package, the linker options file
IRAS90\_LINK\_ADAM should be used. For example, to compile and link an ADAM
application called PROG with the IRQ library, the following commands should be
used: 

\begin{verbatim}
$ ADAMSTART
$ ADAMDEV
$ IRAS90
$ IRAS90_DEV
$ FORT PROG
$ ALINK PROG, IRAS90_LINK_ADAM/OPT 
\end{verbatim}

Stand-alone (i.e. non-ADAM) applications can be linked with the ``standalone''
version of IRQ. This version excludes the routines described in appendix
\ref{APP:ADAM}. To do this the link options file IRAS90\_LINK should be used
instead of IRAS90\_LINK\_ADAM. Thus to compile and link a stand-alone
application with the IRQ package, the following commands should be given: 

\begin{verbatim}
$ IRAS90
$ IRAS90_DEV
$ FORT PROG
$ LINK PROG, IRAS90_LINK/OPT 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{UNIX}

Each terminal session which is to include the compilation or linking of 
applications which use any IRAS90 sub-package should do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Execute the {\bf iras90} command. This sets up an alias for the 
{\bf iras90\_dev} command.

\item Execute the {\bf iras90\_dev} command.  This creates soft links
within the current directory to
all the iras90 include files, defines an environment variable IRAS90\_SRC
pointing to the IRAS90 source directory, adds the {\bf bin}
sub-directory of IRAS90\_SRC on to the end of the current value for the
environment variable PATH, and adds the {\bf lib} sub-directory of 
IRAS90\_SRC on to the end of the current value for the environment 
variable LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH. The command {\bf iras90\_dev star} will do
the same but will also create soft links to all starlink include files
(i.e. all files in the directory /star/include).

\item If a UNIX application accesses any include files (such as
IRQ\_PAR) then they should be specified (within the source file) in upper case 
without any directory
path. The I90\_PAR file (for instance) can be included using the statement

\verb+      INCLUDE 'I90_PAR'+\\

\item Soft links can be deleted (using the {\bf rm} command) when no longer 
needed.
The command {\bf iras90\_dev remove} will remove all IRAS90 soft links from
the current directory. The command {\bf iras90\_dev remove star} will
remove all IRAS90 and Starlink soft links from the current directory.
Note, soft links are only accessable in the directory from which the {bf ln} 
or {\bf iras90\_dev} command was issued. 
\item For ADAM applications the following {\bf alink} command should be used:

\verb+% alink prog.f -L$IRAS90_SRC/lib `irq_link_adam`+\\

where {\bf prog.f} is the fortran source file for the ATASK.
Note the use of opening apostrophies (`) instead of the more usual closing
apostrophy (') in the above {\bf alink} command.

\item For a stand-alone program the following {\bf f77} command should be used:

\verb+% f77 prog.f -o prog -L$IRAS90_SRC/lib `irq_link`+\\
\end{enumerate}

\section {Templates for IRQ Routines Within the VAX LSE Editor}
The STARLSE package (see SUN/105) provides facilities for initialising the VAX
Language Sensitive Editor (LSE) to simplify the generation of Fortran
code conforming to the Starlink programming standard (see SGP/16). One of the
facilities provided by LSE is the automatic production of argument lists for
subroutine calls. Templates for all the subroutines in the IRQ package can be 
made available within LSE by performing the following steps (within LSE):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Issue the LSE command GOTO FILE/READ IRQ\_DIR:IRQ.LSE
\item Issue the LSE command DO
\item Move to a buffer holding a .FOR of a .GEN file in the usual way.
\item IRQ subroutine templates are then available by typing in the name of an 
IRQ subroutine (or an abbreviation) and expanding it (CTRL-E).
\item Help on the subroutine and its arguments can be obtained by placing the
cursor at a point in the buffer at which the subroutine name has been entered 
and pressing GOLD-PF2.
\end{enumerate}

\section {Using IRQ Without the Rest of IRAS90}
\label {APP:NOSTAR}
If the IRAS90 package has not been installed as part of the Starlink 
Software Collection, then some of the instructions given above need to be 
changed. In this appendix the term ``IRQ root directory'' is used to refer to
the directory containing the released IRQ files (on either VMS or UNIX).

\subsection{Compiling and Linking}
On VMS systems the IRAS90 start-up commands should be omitted and the 
development command IRQ\_DEV should be used in place of IRAS90\_DEV. The
linker options files IRQ\_LINK and IRQ\_LINK\_ADAM should be used instead
of IRAS90\_LINK and IRAS90\_LINK\_ADAM.

On UNIX systems, the {\bf iras90} startup command should be omitted and the
development command {\bf irq\_dev} should be used instead of {\bf iras90\_dev}. 
The link files {\bf irq\_link} and {\bf irq\_link\_adam} should be used instead
of {\bf iras90\_link} and {\bf iras90\_link\_adam}. 

\section {HDS Data Structures}
The IRQ package uses several different HDS data structures. These are described 
in this appendix. HDS {\em names} are indicated by being placed within
square brackets ({[} {]}), and HDS {\em types} are indicated by being placed 
within angled brackets ($<$ $>$).
\subsection{Quality names information stored in an NDF}
Information describing the quality names which are defined within an NDF is
stored in a structure called {[}{\bf QUALITY\_NAMES}{]}, with HDS {\em type} 
$<${\bf QUALITY\_NAMES}$>$. This structure can be stored in any extension 
within the NDF. The components of this structure are shown in table \ref 
{TAB:QN}.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\caption{Components of a $<${\bf QUALITY\_NAMES}$>$ structure}
\label{TAB:QN}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Component Name & TYPE & Brief Description \\ \hline
{[}{\bf QUAL}{]} & $<${\bf IRQ\_QUAL}$>$ & Vector of quality name definitions\\
{[}{\bf LAST\_USED}{]} & $<${\bf \_INTEGER}$>$ & Highest used index within 
{[}{\bf QUAL}{]}\\
{[}{\bf NFREE}{]} & $<${\bf \_INTEGER}$>$ & No. of un-used cells within
{[}{\bf QUAL}{]}\\
{[}{\bf FREE}(NFREE){]} & $<${\bf \_INTEGER}$>$ & Vector holding indices of 
un-used cells in {[}{\bf QUAL}{]}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The {[}{\bf QUAL}{]} component is a vector in which each cell is a structure
holding various items of information needed to define a single quality name. The
array has an initial size of 8 but is increased if necessary.
There will usually be some unused cells within {[}{\bf QUAL}{]},
and the other components of the {[}{\bf QUALITY\_NAMES}{]} structure listed in
table \ref {TAB:QN} are used to locate these unused cells. In particular,
{[}{\bf FREE}{]} is a vector which holds the indices of all unused cells within
{[}{\bf QUAL}{]}. These indices may appear in any order within in {[}{\bf
FREE}{]}. 

The set of five HDS locators returned by routines IRQ\_NEW and IRQ\_FIND include
locators to each of the four components of the {[}{\bf QUALITY\_NAMES}{]}
structure, together with a locator for a temporary HDS structure holding a
single $<${\bf \_INTEGER}$>$ scalar used to store the cloned NDF identifier. 

The information describing each individual quality name is stored in a single
cell of the {[}{\bf QUAL}{]} vector. The components within each cell of this 
array are listed in table \ref {TAB:QUAL}.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\caption{Components of a $<${\bf IRQ\_QUAL}$>$ structure}
\label{TAB:QUAL}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Component Name & TYPE & Brief Description \\ \hline
{[}{\bf NAME}{]} & $<${\bf \_CHAR}$>*$15 & A quality name \\
{[}{\bf FIXED}{]} & $<${\bf \_LOGICAL}$>$ & True if all pixels are in the same 
state\\
{[}{\bf VALUE}{]} & $<${\bf \_LOGICAL}$>$ & The state of all pixels, if fixed\\
{[}{\bf BIT}{]} & $<${\bf \_INTEGER}$>$ & QUALITY bit used to store this 
quality\\
{[}{\bf COMMENT}{]} & $<${\bf \_CHAR}$>*$50 & A descriptive comment for the 
quality\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

If {\em all} pixels hold a given quality, or if {\em no} pixels hold the
quality, then a true value is stored for {[}{\bf FIXED}{]}. A true value is
stored for {[}{\bf VALUE}{]} if {\em all} pixels hold the quality, and a false
value if {\em no} pixels hold the quality. In either case, {[}{\bf BIT}{]} is
ignored since no QUALITY bit needs to be reserved for the quality name, thus
allowing more than 8 quality names to be defined simultaneously. 

If some pixels {\em do} hold the quality but some {\em do not}, then a false 
value is stored for {[}{\bf FIXED}{]} and {[}{\bf VALUE}{]} is ignored. In this 
case, a QUALITY bit is reserved to represent the quality and its bit number (in 
the range 1 to 8) is stored in {[}{\bf BIT}{]}.

\subsection{Temporary structures used to hold compiled quality expressions}
When routine IRQ\_COMP is called to compile a quality expression, the resulting
information (known as a ``compiled quality expression'') is stored in a
temporary HDS structure. Up to ten compiled quality expressions can exist
simultaneously, each being stored in one cell of an array of temporary
structures. The identifier returned by IRQ\_COMP is just an index within this
array. Each cell of the array has an HDS {\em name} of {[}{\bf QEXP}{]} and an
HDS {\em type} of $<${\bf QEXP}$>$, and contains the components listed in table
\ref {TAB:QEXP}. 

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\caption{Components of a $<${\bf QEXP}$>$ structure}
\label{TAB:QEXP}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Component Name & TYPE & Brief Description \\ \hline
{[}{\bf MASKS}{]} & $<${\bf \_INTEGER}$>$ & A vector of bit masks\\
{[}{\bf OPCODE}{]} & $<${\bf \_INTEGER}$>$ & A vector of instruction codes\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Each bit mask held in {[}{\bf MASKS}{]} specifies a set of QUALITY bits which
are to be tested as part of the evaluation of a quality expression performed by
routine IRQ\_SBAD. The instruction codes held in {[}{\bf OPCODE}{]} represent
the operations which must be performed on a ``First In - Last Out'' stack in
order to evaluate a quality expression. The sizes of theses vectors are held in
common. 

\section {Examples of Using IRQ}
\newcommand{\numcir}[1]{\mbox{\hspace{3ex}$\bigcirc$\hspace{-1.7ex}{\small #1}}}
\label{APP:EXAMS}
\subsection {Adding a new quality name}
This example shows a VMS code fragment which adds the quality name SATURATED to an
NDF and then assigns the quality to all pixels with value greater than 10.0.
An error is reported if the quality name is already in use.

Programming notes:

\begin{enumerate}

\item NDFIN is the NDF identifier for the input NDF and should have been
obtained previously. If the NDF contains no quality name information, then
an error will be reported by IRQ\_FIND.

\item The quality expression must be assigned to a character variable, since the
call to IRQ\_COMP updates the expression by removing leading blanks, and
converting the expression to upper case. An access violation would result if a
literal string were supplied as an argument, instead of a character variable. If
either of the quality names ``SATURATED'' or ``BACKGROUND'' is not defined in
the input NDF, then an error will be reported by IRQ\_COMP, and the undefined
names will be returned in the UNDEF array.

   QUALTOBAD
}{
   Set pixels bad on the basis of quality
}{
   \sstdescription{
      A quality name is a text string used to describe a certain quality
      held by selected pixels in an NDF (see application SETQUAL).
      Several such names can be defined within an NDF. This application
      selects pixels within the input NDF which have a given
      combination of qualities, and produces an output copy of the
      input NDF in which all such pixels are set to the `bad{\tt '} value in
      the DATA component (any VARIANCE values are left unchanged).

      The combination of qualities required of the pixels which are to
      be set bad in the output is specified by the `quality expression{\tt '}
      given by parameter QEXP. The simplest form of quality expression
      consists of a single quality name. A quality expression of
      {\tt "}SATURATED{\tt "} would cause all input pixels holding the quality
      defined by the quality name {\tt "}SATURATED{\tt "} to be set `bad{\tt '} in the
      output NDF.

      More complex quality expressions can be constructed by joining
      together several quality names in a logical expression using the
      logical operators .AND. .OR. .EQV. .NOT. .XOR. (the delimiting
      dots must be included). In addition quality expressions can
      contain the .TRUE. and .FALSE. logical constants. An example of
      such an expression could be SOURCE .AND. .NOT. SATURATED.
      Parentheses may be used as in a normal arithmetic expression, eg
      ( SOURCE\_A .OR. SOURCE\_B ) .AND. .NOT. SATURATED. If the given
      quality expression contains a syntax error, or refers to any
      quality names which are not defined in the input NDF, a message
      is given identifying the error, and the user is reprompted for a
      new expression.

      The quality expression {\tt "}ANY{\tt "} is used to specify all input pixels
      irrespective of quality (an unlikely requirement in this
      particular application, since it would cause all output pixels to
      be set `bad{\tt '}!).

}{
   Assign a specific quality to selected pixels of an NDF
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This applications associates a `quality name{\tt '}, with selected
      pixels in an NDF. Quality names are text strings which describe
      some quality of the pixels to which it is assigned, examples may
      be {\tt "}SATURATED{\tt "}, {\tt "}BACKGROUND{\tt "}, {\tt "}COSMIC RAY{\tt "}, etc. These quality
      names may be used by later applications to decide which pixels to
      operate on. For instance, a later application may be told to
      operate only on those pixels which have a quality satisfying the
      expression {\tt "}.NOT. SATURATED{\tt "}. The use of these quality names to
      flag conditions is non-destructive, i.e. the original data values
      are left unaltered. This is not true if the `bad value{\tt '} technique
      is used to flag such conditions, as the original data value is
      overwritten with the `bad{\tt '} value.

      The user specifies the quality name to be assigned to selected
      pixels within the NDF (see parameter QNAME). If this name is not
      currently defined within the NDF then a definition of the name is
      added to the NDF.

      The user selects the pixels which are to have their quality
      modified either by giving a `mask{\tt '} NDF, or a text file containing
      a list of pixel indices (see parameters SELECT, MASK and LIST).
      In the first case, the `bad{\tt '} pixels in the mask NDF define the
      selected pixels. In the second case, the pixel indices stored in
      the text file define the selected pixels.

      The exact operation to be performed on all the selected pixels is
      specified by parameter FUNCTION. Options exists to assign or
      remove the quality to or from all selected or un-selected pixels.
      When deciding which function is required, it must be remembered
      that some pixels may already hold the quality specified by QNAME
      (if the name was already defined within the NDF). Thus, for
      instance, assigning a quality to selected pixels does not of
      itself ensure that none of the un-selected pixel do not hold the
      quality as well. To do this, the quality must be removed from
      un-selected pixels as well as being assigned to the selected
      pixels.

\section{Templates for IRQ Routines Within the VAX LSE Editor}
The STARLSE package (see SUN/105) provides facilities for initialising the VAX
Language Sensitive Editor (LSE) to simplify the generation of Fortran
code conforming to the Starlink programming standard (see SGP/16). One of the
facilities provided by LSE is the automatic production of argument lists for
subroutine calls. Templates for all the subroutines in the IRQ package can be 
made available within LSE by performing the following steps (within LSE):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Issue the LSE command GOTO FILE/READ IRQ\_DIR:IRQ.LSE
\item Issue the LSE command DO
\item Issue the LSE command DELETE BUFFER
\item Move to a buffer holding a .FOR of a .GEN file in the usual way.
\item IRQ subroutine templates are then available by typing in the name of an 
IRQ subroutine (or an abbreviation) and expanding it (CTRL-E).
\item Help on the subroutine and its arguments can be obtained by placing the
cursor at a point in the buffer at which the subroutine name has been entered 
and pressing GOLD-PF2.
\end{enumerate}

\section {Packages Called by IRQ}
IRQ\_ makes calls to the following packages:
\begin {description}
\item [CHR\_] - The CHR character handling package; see SUN/40.
\item [CMP\_] - HDS; see SUN/92.
\item [DAT\_] - HDS; see SUN/92.
\item [ERR\_] - The Starlink error reporting package; see SUN/104.
\item [MSG\_] - The Starlink message reporting package; see SUN/104.
\item [NDF\_] - The NDF access package; see SUN/33.
\item [VEC\_] - The PRIMDAT package; see SUN/39.
\end{description}

Access to these packages, together with packages called from within these 
packages, is necessary to use IRQ. 

\section {IRQ Error Codes}
\label {APP:ERRORS}
IRQ routines can return any STATUS value generated by the subroutine packages 
which it calls. In addition it can return the following IRQ-specific values 

\begin{description}

\section {Changes Introduced in the Current Version of this Document}
\label {SEC:CHANGES}

Changes introduced in version 4 of ID6:
\begin {enumerate}
\item Description of the use of IRQ on UNIX machines included.
\item STARLSE templates and help available for IRQ subroutines.
\item It is no longer necessary to include I90\_PAR before including
IRQ\_ERR.
\item The names of symbolic constants (both errors and parameters) which previously 
were longer than five characters (excluding the IRQ\_\_ prefix) have been
truncated to five characters. The actual {\em values} associated with each name 
have not changed.
\item The VMS version of IRQ is now released in the form of a sharable image 
rather than an object library. Applications linked with the sharable image have 
the advantage that they will not need to be {\em re}-linked when IRQ is upgraded 
in future. Note, the object library has been removed from the IRQ system.
\item The linking and development procedures have been modified to bring them 
into line with Starlink standards (see SSN/8).

\end {enumerate}
