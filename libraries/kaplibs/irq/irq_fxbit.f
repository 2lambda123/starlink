      SUBROUTINE IRQ_FXBIT( LOCS, QNAME, BIT, FIXBIT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_FXBIT

*  Purpose:
*     Assign a fixed bit number to a quality name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_FXBIT( LOCS, QNAME, BIT, SET, FIXBIT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine associates a fixed bit number with a specified quality
*     name. Normally, IRQ manages the allocation of bit numbers to named
*     qualities, but this routine allows the calling application to specify
*     which bit is to be used for a given quality.
*
*     By default, a QUALITY array bit is associated with a quality name
*     only if some pixels hold the quality and some do not hold the
*     quality (i.e. there is a mix of values). Otherwise, a flag is stored
*     in the QUALITY_NAMES structure indicating this, and any quality bit
*     previously associated with the quality name is released for re-use.
*
*     This default behaviour is changed by calling this routine. The 
*     specified bit number will continue to be associated with the quality 
*     name even if all pixels do, or do not, hold the quality.
*
*     An error will be returned if the named quality is already associated 
*     with a different bit number when this routine is called.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS(5) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An array of 5 HDS locators. These locators identify the NDF
*        and the associated quality name information.  They should have
*        been obtained using routine IRQ_FIND or routine IRQ_NEW.
*     QNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The quality name to use. Leading blanks are ignored and
*        the search is case-insensitive. The maximum allowed length for
*        quality names is given by symbolic constant IRQ__SZQNM which
*        currently has the value of 15.
*     BIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The bit number to use. The least significant bit is bit 1, not
*        bit 0. If value below 0 or above 8 is supplied, the properties
*        of the quality name are left unchanged, but the FIXBIT value is 
*        still returned.
*     FIXBIT = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Returned .TRUE. if the specified qualit name had a fixed bit
*        number on entry to this routine, and .FALSE. otherwise.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
