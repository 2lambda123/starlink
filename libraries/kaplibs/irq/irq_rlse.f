      SUBROUTINE IRQ_RLSE( LOCS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_RLSE

*  Purpose:
*     Release a temporary structure created by IRQ_NEW or IRQ_FIND.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_RLSE( LOCS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine releases the resources reserved by a call to IRQ_NEW
*     or IRQ_FIND. The cloned NDF identifier held in LOCS(1) is
*     annulled, and then all the five HDS locators in LOCS are annulled.
*     If no defined quality names exist within the NDF, then the
*     structure used to hold such names is deleted and the QUALITY
*     component of the NDF is reset to an undefined state.
*
*     Note, this routine attempts to execute even if STATUS is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS(5) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An array of 5 HDS locators. These locators identify the NDF
*        and the associated quality name information.  They should have
*        been obtained using routine IRQ_FIND or routine IRQ_NEW.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
