      SUBROUTINE IRQ_RWQN( LOCS, QNAME, SET, NEWVAL, OLDVAL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_RWQN

*  Purpose:
*     Get and/or set the read-only flag for a quality name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_RWQN( LOCS, QNAME, SET, NEWVAL, OLDVAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the current value of the read-only flag
*     associated with a quality name, and optionally assigns a new 
*     value to the flag.
*
*     If the read-only flag is set for a quality name, any attempt to
*     remove the quality name using IRQ_REMQN will result in an error 
*     being reported.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS(5) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An array of 5 HDS locators. These locators identify the NDF
*        and the associated quality name information.  They should have
*        been obtained using routine IRQ_FIND or routine IRQ_NEW.
*     QNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The quality name to use. Leading blanks are ignored and
*        the search is case-insensitive. The maximum allowed length for
*        quality names is given by symbolic constant IRQ__SZQNM which
*        currently has the value of 15.
*     SET = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then the read-only flag for the quality name will be
*        set to the value supplied in NEWVAL. Otherwise, the current
*        value of the flag will be left unchanged.
*     NEWVAL = LOGICAL (Given)
*        The new value for the read-only flag. Only accessed if SET is
*        true.
*     OLDVAL = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        The value of the read-only flag on entry to this routine. If the
*        old value is of no interest, it is safe to supply the same 
*        variable for OLDVAL as for NEWVAL since OLDVAL is updated after
*        NEWVAL is used.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
