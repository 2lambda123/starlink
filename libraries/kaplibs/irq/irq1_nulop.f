      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_NULOP( I, NOPC, OPCODE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_NULOP

*  Purpose:
*     Nullify an instruction and the instructions which generate its
*     operands.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     IRQ1_NULOP( I, NOPC, OPCODE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The instruction with index I is replaced by NULL. If the
*     instruction has any operands, then all the instructions which are
*     used to generate the operands are also replaced by NULL.

*  Arguments:
*     I = Index of instruction to be nullified within OPCODE.
*     NOPC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The no. of instruction codes in OPCODE.
*     OPCODE( NOPC ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        List of instruction codes.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
