      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_INDF( LOCS, INDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_INDF

*  Purpose:
*     Get the NDF identifier.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_INDF( LOCS, BIT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The NDF identifier is obtained from LOCS(1), and checked for
*     validity. If it is invalid an error is reported.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS( 5 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A set of 5 HDS locators. LOCS( 1 ) locates a temporary
*        structure holding a cloned NDF identifier. LOCS(2) locates the
*        QUAL array. LOCS(3) locates the LAST_USED value, holding the
*        index of the last used slot in the QUAL array. LOCS(4) locates
*        the NFREE value, holding the number of free slots in the QUAL
*        array. LOCS(5) locates the FREE array, which contains a stack
*        of the NFREE slot indices corresponding to free slots. This
*        stack is accessed in a "First-In-Last-Out" method.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The cloned identifier for the NDF in which the quality name
*        information is stored.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
