      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_CMQM( NOPC, NQNAME, OPCODE, MASKS, NMASKS,
     :                      STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_CMQM

*  Purpose:
*     Combine multiple quality masks into single masks.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_CMQM( NOPC, NQNAME, OPCODE, MASKS, NMASKS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Initially, all quality bits are tested individually, by performing
*     a logical AND operation between a QUALITY byte, and a mask
*     containing a single set bit. It is more efficient to test more
*     than one bit if possible. E.G. a quality expression such as
*     A.AND.B, requires the quality bit corresponding to "A" to be
*     tested and loaded on the evaluation stack, then the same must be
*     done for "B", and finally and AND performed between the top two
*     stack entries. Instead, the two bits corresponding to qualities
*     "A" and "B" can be combined (using a bit-wise OR operation) into a
*     single mask. The two quality bits can then be loaded on to the
*     stack in a single operation which incorporates the AND in the
*     original quality expression. i.e. set the stack to .TRUE. if:
*
*         IAND( QUAL, MASK ) .EQ. MASK
*
*     and .FALSE. otherwise, where QUAL is the QUALITY byte, and MASK
*     is the combined mask. If the original expression had been
*     A.OR.B then instead of the above logical expression, the following
*     would be used:
*
*         IAND( QUAL, MASK ) .NE. 0
*
*     The masks used in the above two expressions can contain any number
*     of set bits. If the original expression had been A.EQV.B then the
*     stack is set to the value of:
*
*         ( IAND( QUAL, MASK ) .EQ. MASK ) .OR.
*         ( IAND( QUAL, MASK ) .EQ. 0 )
*
*     If the original expression had been A.XOR.B then the stack is set
*     to the value of:
*
*         ( IAND( QUAL, MASK ) .NE. MASK ) .OR.
*         ( IAND( QUAL, MASK ) .NE. 0 )
*
*     The masks used in the above two expressions must contain no more
*     than two set bits. If the original expression had been .NOT.A
*     then the stack is set to the value of:
*
*         IAND( QUAL, MASK ) .NE. MASK
*
*     The mask used in the above expression may only contain a single
*     set bit.
*
*     If any of the above cases are found in the compiled quality
*     expression given in OPCODE, then each LDQ instruction ( which
*     tests and loads a single quality bit) is replaced by one of
*     the instructions LDQE, LDQX, LDQO, LDQA or LDQN. These five
*     instructions are used to replace LDQ instructions which generate
*     the operands used by EQV, XOR, OR, AND or NOT instructions
*     respectively.

*  Arguments:
*     NOPC = INTEGER (Given)
*        No. of op. codes contained in OPCODE.
*     NQNAME = INTEGER (Given)
*        No. of individual quality names referenced in the quality
*        expression.
*     OPCODE( * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The integer op. codes representing the operations which must be
*        performed on a FILO stack to evaluate the quality expression.
*        On input this contains operations which test a single bit of
*        the QUALITY component. On output some of these operations may
*        have been combined together into bit-wise operations between
*        the QUALITY component and masks containing more than 1 set bit.
*        The gaps thus created are filled by NULL instructions.
*     MASKS( * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        On entry, this contains a bit mask for each bit to be tested
*        in the QUALITY component (the bit to be tested is set in the
*        mask and all other bits are cleared). On exit, some of these
*        masks may have been combined together so that they contain
*        more than one set bit. Masks are used in the order they are
*        stored in this array, i.e. the first LDQ instruction in OPCODE
*        uses MASKS(1), the second uses MASKS(2), etc.
*     NMASKS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        No. of masks in the MASKS on exit. This will be less than
*        NQNAMES if any masks have been combined.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  VAX-specific features used:
