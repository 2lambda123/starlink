      SUBROUTINE IRQ_RESQL( LOCS, LISTED, QNAME, NDIM, NCOORD, LIST,
     :                      SET, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_RESQL

*  Purpose:
*     Remove a quality from a list of pixels, leaving unlisted pixels
*     unchanged.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_RESQL( LOCS, LISTED, QNAME, NDIM, NCOORD, LIST, SET,
*                     STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The quality specified by QNAME is removed from all pixels
*     included in (or, if LISTED is false, not included in) the
*     supplied list of pixel indices. The quality of other pixels
*     is left unaltered.  The quality name must be defined in the NDF
*     specified by LOCS (LOCS should be obtained either by calling
*     IRQ_FIND or IRQ_NEW). An error is reported if the quality name is
*     undefined.
*
*     Note, write or update access must be available for the NDF (as
*     set up by routine LPG_ASSOC for instance), and the QUALITY
*     component must not be mapped on entry to this routine.
*
*  Arguments:
*     LOCS(5) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An array of 5 HDS locators. These locators identify the NDF
*        and the associated quality name information.  They should have
*        been obtained using routine IRQ_FIND or routine IRQ_NEW.
*     LISTED = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then the quality is removed from all pixels included
*        in the list given by LIST.  If false, then the quality is
*        removed from all pixels not included in the list given by LIST.
*     QNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The quality name to be removed from the selected pixels. This
*        quality name must be defined in the NDF specified by LOC. Name
*        definitions can be added to the NDF using routine IRQ_ADDQN.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of values required to specify a pixel position
*        (i.e. the number of dimensions in the NDF).
*     NCOORD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels included in the input list.
*     LIST( NDIM, NCOORD ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The list of pixel indices. Any indices which lie outside the
*        bounds of the NDF are ignored.
*     SET = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of pixels which hold the quality.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
