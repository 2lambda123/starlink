      SUBROUTINE IRQ_DELET( INDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_DELET

*  Purpose:
*     Delete all quality name information from an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_DELET( INDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A search is made through the extensions contained within the
*     supplied NDF for an HDS structure containing quality name
*     information. If found, the QUALITY_NAMES structure containing the 
*     quality names is deleted.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The input NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
