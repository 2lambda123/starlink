*  Name:
*     IRQ1_QLST

*  Purpose:
*     Set a QUALITY bit for pixels determined by a list.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_QLST( BIT, LISTED, SET, NDIM, NCOORD, LIST, LBND,
*                     UBND, SIZE, QUAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     If SET is true then selected pixels in the QUALITY vector have
*     the specified bit set. If SET is false, then the selected pixels
*     have the specified bit cleared. If LISTED is true then pixels are
*     selected if they appear in the supplied list of pixel
*     coordinates. If LISTED is false then pixels are selected if they
*     do not appear in the list. Listed pixels which lie outside the
*     supplied pixel bounds are ignored.

*  Arguments:
*     BIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The bit number within the QUALITY component. The least
*        significant bit is called bit 1 (not bit 0).
*     LISTED = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then the operation specified by SET is performed on
*        all the pixels in the list of coordinates given by LIST.  If
*        false, then the operation specified by SET is performed on all
*        the pixels which are not in the list of coordinates given by
*        LIST.
*     SET = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then the selected pixels have the given bit set,
*        indicating that the corresponding quality is held.  If false,
*        then the selected pixels have the given bit cleared,
*        indicating that the corresponding quality is not held.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions. This determines how many coordinates
*        values are stored for each pixel in the list, and also
*        determines the number of upper and lower bounds supplied in
*        LBND and UBND.
*     NCOORD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in the input list. Each pixel has NDIM
*        coordinate values to describe its position.
*     LIST( NDIM, NCOORD ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The list of pixel positions.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bound on each axis of the pixel space.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bound on each axis of the pixel space.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the QUAL vector. This should be equal to the
*        product of the dimensions implied by LBND and UBND.
*     QUAL( SIZE ) = BYTE (Given and Returned)
*        The QUALITY vector.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  VAX-specific features used:
*     -  Uses BYTE arrays.
