      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_RSLOT( LOCS, SLOT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_RSLOT

*  Purpose:
*     Reserve a slot in the QUAL array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_RSLOT( LOCS, SLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The QUAL array is an array of structures. Each structure holds
*     information describing a single quality name. Each such structure
*     is referred to as a "slot" in the QUAL array. This routine finds a
*     free (i.e. currently unused) slot. If no free slots exist, the
*     QUAL array is extended. Note, calling this routine does not
*     reduce the number of free slots available. All that happens is
*     that a free slot is located. It is up to the calling routine to
*     decide whether to put anything into the slot. The number of free
*     slots is decremented when IRQ1_ADD is called.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS( 5 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A set of 5 HDS locators. LOCS( 1 ) locates a temporary
*        structure holding a cloned NDF identifier. LOCS(2) locates the
*        QUAL array. LOCS(3) locates the LAST_USED value, holding the
*        index of the last used slot in the QUAL array. LOCS(4) locates
*        the NFREE value, holding the number of free slots in the QUAL
*        array. LOCS(5) locates the FREE array, which contains a stack
*        of the NFREE slot indices corresponding to free slots. This
*        stack is accessed in a "First-In-Last-Out" method.
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An index for a currently free slot.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
