      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_GTIDQ( LOCS, NMASKS, MASKS, NOPC, OPCODE, MXSTK,
     :                       IDQ, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_GTIDQ

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new compiled quality expression structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_GTIDQ( LOCS, NMASKS, MASKS, NOPC, OPCODE, MXSTK, IDQ,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The IRQ_ system stores information describing each compiled
*     quality expression in arrays in common.  The same element from
*     different arrays holds information for the same compiled quality
*     expression. Different elements within each array hold information
*     for different compiled quality expressions. The identifiers used
*     by IRQ to identify each compiled quality expression are just the
*     index into these common arrays at which the information
*     describing the compiled quality expression is stored. The arrays
*     in common have a lower bound of 1 and an upper bound given by
*     symbolic constant IRQ__MAXQ.
*
*     The common arrays hold the scalars needed to describe each
*     compiled quality expression.  The vectors needed to describe each
*     compiled quality expression are stored in temporary HDS
*     structures. These structures have an HDS type of QEXP. An array
*     of QEXP structures is created, of equal size to the common
*     arrays.  Each cell of this array is a single QEXP structure and
*     contains the following components:
*
*     MASKS( QCM_NMASK ) (_INTEGER) - These are bit masks which are
*     combined with each value from the QUALITY component of the NDF.
*     The uses of these masks is described in routine IRQ1_CMQM.
*
*     OPCODE( QCM_NOPC ) (_INTEGER) - Integer codes identifying the
*     operations which must be performed to evaluate the quality
*     expression. The codes are defined in module IRQ_OPC.
*
*     HDS locators to all these components are stored in common. The
*     arrays are kept permanently mapped until the compiled quality
*     expression is annulled.  The pointers are also stored in common.
*
*     This routine finds the lowest common array index not currently in
*     use, and returns it as the IDQ identifier value. If there is no
*     free space in the common arrays an error is reported. The
*     identifier thus found is used as an index into the HDS array of
*     QEXP structures. The components listed above are created within
*     the QEXP structure indexed by IDQ. The locator to the QEXP
*     structure is stored in common.
*
*     If any error occurs, an invalid compiled quality expression
*     identifier (IRQ__NOID) is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS( 5 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A set of 5 HDS locators. LOCS( 1 ) locates a temporary
*        structure holding a cloned NDF identifier. LOCS(2) locates the
*        QUAL array. LOCS(3) locates the LAST_USED value, holding the
*        index of the last used slot in the QUAL array. LOCS(4) locates
*        the NFREE value, holding the number of free slots in the QUAL
*        array. LOCS(5) locates the FREE array, which contains a stack
*        of the NFREE slot indices corresponding to free slots. This
*        stack is accessed in a "First-In-Last-Out" method.
*     NMASKS = INTEGER (Given)
*        No. of masks needed to evaluate the quality expression.
*     MASKS( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Masks defining tests to be performed on the QUALITY component.
*        These are accessed by the "LOAD QUALITY" instructions stored in
*        OPCODE, in the order in which such instructions appear in
*        OPCODE.
*     NOPC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of op. codes in OPCODE.
*     OPCODE( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The codes which define the operations which must be performed
*        in order to evaluate the quality expression.
*     MXSTK = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum stack size needed to evaluate the quality
*        expression.
*     IDQ = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The IRQ identifier for the new compile quality expression. Set
*        to IRQ__NOID if an error occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
