*+
*  Name:
*     MIO_SKIPB
 
*  Purpose:
*     Skip Blocks.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL MIO_SKIPB(TD, NBLOCK, STATUS)
 
*  Description:
*     Skip the specified number of blocks.
 
*  Arguments:
*     TD=INTEGER (Given)
*        A variable containing the tape descriptor.
*     NBLOCK=INTEGER (Given)
*        Expression specifying the number of blocks to be skipped.
*        A negative number indicates that the tape is to be moved
*        in the reverse direction (towards its load point).
*     STATUS=INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Variable holding the status value.   If this variable is not
*        SAI__OK on input, then the routine will return without action.  If
*        the routine fails to complete, this variable will be set to an
*        appropriate error number.
*        N.B. This routine does not report its own errors.
 
*  Algorithm:
*     Check for a valid tape descriptor and that the tape is open, if so, the
*     tape descriptor is used to get a device channel number and each block is
*     skipped by a call to the ioc_skipb routine.
*     It is an error to attempt to jump across a Tape Mark with this routine.
