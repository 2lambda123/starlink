 
      SUBROUTINE MAG1_FXPOS(TP, FILE, START, BLOCK, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     MAG1_FXPOS
 
*  Purpose:
*     Fix tape position, even if it means rewinding tape.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL MAG1_FXPOS(TD, FILE, START, BLOCK, STATUS)
 
*  Description:
*     Ensure that the tape position is known, even if it means rewinding the
*     tape to its load point.
 
*  Arguments:
*     TD=INTEGER (Given)
*        Tape descriptor.
*     FILE=INTEGER (Returned)
*        Variable to receive the tape file number.   This is returned
*        zero if not known.
*     START=LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Variable to receive whether the tape is positioned at the start
*        of a file.   It is only returned if BLOCK is non-zero.
*     BLOCK=INTEGER (Returned)
*        Variable to receive the block number.   If START is TRUE
*        then this is relative to the start of the file;  otherwise
*        it is relative to the end of the file.   It is returned zero
*        if not known.
*     STATUS=INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Variable holding the status value.   If this variable is not
*        SAI__OK on input, then the routine will return without action.  If
*        the routine fails to complete, this variable will be set to an
*        appropriate error number.
 
*  Algorithm:
*     If the file number is undefined then the tape is rewound.
*     If the file position is still not known then give up.
