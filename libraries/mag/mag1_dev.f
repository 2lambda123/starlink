      LOGICAL FUNCTION MAG1_DEV(TP, DEVICE)
*+
*  Name:
*     MAG1_DEV

*  Purpose:
*     get VMS device name name from tape descriptor.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     STATUS = MAG1_DEV(TP, DEVICE)

*  Description:
*     The name of the VMS device associated with the supplied tape
*     descriptor, TP, is returned in DEVICE.

*  Arguments:
*     TP=INTEGER (Given)
*        A variable containing the tape descriptor
*     DEVICE=CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        VMS Device name of the tape unit

*  Returned Value:
*     MAG1_DEV = LOGICAL
*        Set .TRUE. if legal request

*  Algorithm:
*     Use TP to index directly into the arrays in the MAG_IO Common Block.
