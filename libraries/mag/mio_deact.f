*+
*  Name:
*     MIO_DEACT
 
*  Purpose:
*     terminate MIO system.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL MIO_DEACT(STATUS)
 
*  Description:
*     The MIO system is run down.
 
*  Arguments:
*     STATUS=INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Variable holding the status value.   If the routine fails to
*        complete, this variable will be set to an appropriate error number.
*        If this variable is not SAI__OK on inpu, then the routine will
*        still attempt to execute, but will return the STATUS set to the
*        import value.
 
*  Algorithm:
*     The MIO_STOP routine is called to shut down MIO.
