      SUBROUTINE MIO_STOP(STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     MIO_STOP
 
*  Purpose:
*     Close down MIO.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL MIO_STOP(STATUS)
 
*  Description:
*     Close all open files.
 
*  Arguments:
*     STATUS=INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Variable holding the status value.   If the routine fails to
*        complete, this variable will be set to an appropriate error number.
*        If this variable is not SAI__OK on input, then the routine will
*        still attempt to execute, but will return with STATUS set to the
*        import value.
*        N.B. This routine does not report its own errors.
 
*  Algorithm:
*     The MIO system is run down by successive calls to MIO_CLOSE for each
*     active tape descriptor.
