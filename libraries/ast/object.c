*class++
*  Name:
*     Object

*  Purpose:
*     Base class for all AST Objects.

*  Constructor Function:
*     None.

*  Description:
*     This class is the base class from which all other classes in the
*     AST library are derived. It provides all the basic Object
*     behaviour and Object manipulation facilities required throughout
*     the library. There is no Object constructor, however, as Objects
*     on their own are not useful.

*  Inheritance:
*     The Object base class does not inherit from any other class.

*  Attributes:
*     All Objects have the following attributes:
*
*     - Class: Object class name
*     - ID: Object identification string
*     - Ident: Permanent Object identification string.
*     - Nobject: Number of Objects in class
*     - RefCount: Count of active Object pointers
*     - UseDefs: Allow use of default values for Object attributes?

*  Functions:
c     The following functions may be applied to all Objects:
f     The following routines may be applied to all Objects:
*
c     - astAnnul: Annul a pointer to an Object
c     - astBegin: Begin a new AST context
c     - astClear: Clear attribute values for an Object
c     - astClone: Clone a pointer to an Object
c     - astCopy: Copy an Object
c     - astDelete: Delete an Object
c     - astEnd: End an AST context

*        Added attribute setting functions.
*     2-JUL-1996 (RFWS):
*        Added functions to support the external interface (using
*        identfiers).
*     10-SEP-1996 (RFWS):
*        Added I/O facilities.
*     30-MAY-1997 (RFWS):
*        Add ID attribute.
*     14-JUL-1997 (RFWS):
*        Add astExempt function.
*     14-OCT-1997 (RFWS):
*        Fixed uninitialised use of "dynamic" in astCopy_.
*     14-NOV-1997 (RFWS):
*        Remove the subversive C "strtok" function.
*     20-JAN-1998 (RFWS):
*        Make the astClear and astVSet methods virtual.
*     29-APR-1998 (RFWS):
*        Fixed bug in algorithm for encoding Object IDs.
*     15-SEP-1999 (RFWS)
*        Made astAnnulId accessible from protected code.
*     12-APR-2000 (DSB):

*        sign in the attribute setting passed to SetAttrib.
*     27-NOV-2002 (DSB):
*        Modified astShow to use astWrite instead of astDump, so that 
*        invocations of astShow will be included in the count of the 
*        number of invocations of astWrite returned by astWriteInvocations.
*     8-JAN-2003 (DSB):
*        Changed private InitVtab method to protected astInitObjectVtab
*        method.

f     This routine deletes an Object, freeing all resources
*     associated with it and rendering any remaining pointers to the
*     Object invalid.
*
*     Note that deletion is unconditional, regardless of whether other
*     pointers to the Object are still in use (possibly within other
*     Objects). A safer approach is to defer deletion, until all
c     references to an Object have expired, by using astBegin/astEnd
c     (together with astClone and astAnnul if necessary).
f     references to an Object have expired, by using AST_BEGIN/AST_END
f     (together with AST_CLONE and AST_ANNUL if necessary).

*  Parameters:
c     this
c        Pointer to the Object to be deleted.
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        Pointer to the Object to be deleted. A null pointer value
f        (AST__NULL) is always returned.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

c  Returned Value:
c     astDelete()
c        A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) is always returned.
c
*  Applicability:
*     Object
c        This function applies to all Objects.
f        This routine applies to all Objects.

*  Notes:
c     - This function attempts to execute even if the AST error status
c     is set
f     - This routine attempts to execute even if STATUS is set to an error
f     value
*     on entry, although no further error report will be
*     made if it subsequently fails under these circumstances.

*  Parameters:

*     attrib
*        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing the name of
*        the attribute whose value is required. This may contain mixed

*        white space.

*  Returned Value:
*     - Pointer to a null-terminated string containing the attribute
*     value.

*  Notes:
*     - The returned string pointer may point at memory allocated
*     within the Object, or at static memory. The contents of the
*     string may be over-written or the pointer may become invalid
*     following a further invocation of the same function or any
*     modification of the Object. A copy of the string should

c     <X>type astGet<X>( AstObject *this, const char *attrib )
f     RESULT = AST_GET<X>( THIS, ATTRIB, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Object methods.

*  Description:
*     This is a family of functions which return a specified attribute
*     value for an Object using one of several different data
*     types. The type is selected by replacing <X> in the function name
c     by C, D, F, I or L, to obtain a result in const char* (i.e. string),
c     double, float, int, or long format, respectively.
f     by C, D, I, L or R, to obtain a result in Character, Double
f     precision, Integer, Logical or Real format, respectively.
*
*     If possible, the attribute value is converted to the type you
*     request. If conversion is not possible, an error will result.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Object.
c     attrib
f     ATTRIB = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing the name of
c        the attribute whose value is required.
f        A character string containing the name of the attribute whose
f        value is required.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astGet<X>()
f     AST_GET<X> = <X>type
c        The attribute value, in the data type corresponding to <X> (or,
c        in the case of astGetC, a pointer to a constant null-terminated
c        character string containing this value).
f        The attribute value, in the data type corresponding to <X>.

*  Applicability:
*     Object
*        These functions apply to all Objects.

*  Examples:
c     printf( "RefCount = %d\n", astGetI( z, "RefCount" ) );
c        Prints the RefCount attribute value for Object "z" as an int.
c     title = astGetC( axis, "Title" );
c        Obtains a pointer to a null-terminated character string containing
c        the Title attribute of Object "axis".
f     WRITE( *, '('' RefCount = '', A10 )' ) AST_GETC( Z, 'RefCount', STATUS )
f        Prints the RefCount attribute value for Object Z as a character
f        string.
f     NAXES = AST_GETI( FRAME, 'Naxes', STATUS )
f        Obtains the value of the Naxes attribute for Object FRAME as an
f        integer.

*  Notes:
*     - Attribute names are not case sensitive and may be surrounded
*     by white space.

*++
*  Name:

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "object.h"
c     void astSet( AstObject *this, const char *settings, ... )
f     CALL AST_SET( THIS, SETTINGS, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Object method.

*  Description:
c     This function assigns a set of attribute values to an Object,
f     This routine assigns a set of attribute values to an Object,
*     over-riding any previous values. The attributes and their new
*     values are specified via a character string, which should
*     contain a comma-separated list of the form:
*
*        "attribute_1 = value_1, attribute_2 = value_2, ... "
*
*     where "attribute_n" specifies an attribute name, and the value
*     to the right of each "=" sign should be a suitable textual
*     representation of the value to be assigned. This value will be
*     interpreted according to the attribute's data type.
c
c     The string supplied may also contain "printf"-style format
c     specifiers, identified by "%" signs in the usual way. If
c     present, these will be substituted by values supplied as
c     additional optional arguments (using the normal "printf" rules)
c     before the string is used.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Object.
c     settings
f     SETTINGS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated character string containing a
c        comma-separated list of attribute settings in the form described
c        above.
f        A character string containing a comma-separated list of
f        attribute settings in the form described above.
c     ...
c        Optional additional arguments which supply values to be
c        substituted for any "printf"-style format specifiers that
c        appear in the "settings" string.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Applicability:
*     Object
c        This function applies to all Objects.
f        This routine applies to all Objects.

*  Examples:
c     astSet( map, "Report = 1, Zoom = 25.0" );
c        Sets the Report attribute for Object "map" to the value 1 and
c        the Zoom attribute to 25.0.
c     astSet( frame, "Label( %d ) =Offset along axis %d", axis, axis );
c        Sets the Label(axis) attribute for Object "frame" to a
c        suitable string, where the axis number is obtained from
c        "axis", a variable of type int.
c     astSet( frame, "Title =%s", mystring );
c        Sets the Title attribute for Object "frame" to the contents of
c        the string "mystring".
f     CALL AST_SET( MAP, 'Report = 1, Zoom = 25.0', STATUS )
f        Sets the Report attribute for Object MAP to the value 1 and
f        the Zoom attribute to 25.0.
f     CALL AST_SET( FRAME, 'Label( 1 ) =Offset from cluster axis', STATUS )
f        Sets the Label(1) attribute for Object FRAME to a suitable
f        string.

*  Notes:
*     - Attribute names are not case sensitive and may be surrounded
*     by white space.
*     - White space may also surround attribute values, where it will
*     generally be ignored (except for string-valued attributes where
*     it is significant and forms part of the value to be assigned).
c     - It is not possible to include a comma directly in the value
c     assigned to an attribute via the "settings" string. To achieve
c     this, you should use "%s" format and supply the value as a
c     separate additional argument to astSet (or use the astSetC
c     function instead).
c     - The same procedure may be adopted if "%" signs are to be included
c     and are not to be interpreted as format specifiers (alternatively,
c     the "printf" convention of writing "%%" may be used).
f     - It is not possible to include a comma in the value to be
f     assigned to an attribute using this routine. If such a value is
f     needed, then AST_SETC should be used instead.
*     - An error will result if an attempt is made to set a value for
*     a read-only attribute.
*--

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - Because this function has a variable argument list, it is
*     invoked by a macro that evaluates to a function pointer (not a
*     function invocation) and no checking or casting of arguments is
*     performed before the function is invoked. Because of this, the
*     Object identifier is of type (void *) and is converted and
*     validated within the function itself.

*     and this will be interpreted according to the attribute's data type.
*     White space surrounding the value is only significant for string

*  Name:
c     astSet<X>
f     AST_SET<X>

*  Purpose:
*     Set an attribute value for an Object.

*  Type:
*     Public functions.

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "object.h"
c     void astSet<X>( AstObject *this, const char *attrib, <X>type value )
f     CALL AST_SET<X>( THIS, ATTRIB, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Object methods.

*  Description:
c     This is a family of functions which set a specified attribute
f     This is a family of routines which set a specified attribute
*     value for an Object using one of several different data
c     types. The type is selected by replacing <X> in the function name
f     types. The type is selected by replacing <X> in the routine name
c     by C, D, F, I or L, to supply a value in const char* (i.e. string),
c     double, float, int, or long format, respectively.
f     by C, D, I, L or R, to supply a value in Character, Double
f     precision, Integer, Logical or Real format, respectively.
*
*     If possible, the value you supply is converted to the type of
*     the attribute. If conversion is not possible, an error will
*     result.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Object.
c     attrib
f     ATTRIB = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated character string containing the
c        name of the attribute whose value is to be set.
f        A character string containing the name of the attribute whose
f        value is to be set.
c     value
f     VALUE = <X>type (Given)
c        The value to be set for the attribute, in the data type corresponding
c        to <X> (or, in the case of astSetC, a pointer to a null-terminated
c        character string containing this value).
f        The value to be set for the attribute, in the data type corresponding
f        to <X>.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Applicability:
*     Object
c        These functions apply to all Objects.
f        These routines apply to all Objects.

*  Examples:
c     astSetI( frame, "Preserve", 1 );
c        Sets the Preserve attribute value for Object "frame" to 1.
c     astSetC( plot, "Format(1)", "%.2g" );
c        Sets the Format(1) attribute value for Object "plot" to the
c        character string "%.2g".
f     CALL AST_SETC( PLOT, 'Title', CVALUE, STATUS )
f        Sets the Title attribute value for Object PLOT to the contents
f        of the character variable CVALUE.
f     CALL AST_SETL( FRAME, 'Preserve', .TRUE., STATUS );
f        Sets the Preserve attribute value for Object FRAME to 1 (true).

*  Notes:
*     - Attribute names are not case sensitive and may be surrounded
*     by white space.
f     - The logical value .FALSE. will translate to a numerical attribute
f     value of zero and logical .TRUE. will translate to one.
*     - An error will result if an attempt is made to set a value for
*     a read-only attribute.

*  Synopsis:

*     void astVSet( AstObject *this, const char *settings, va_list args )

*  Class Membership:
*     Object method.

*  Description:
*     This function assigns a set of attribute values for an Object,
*     the attributes and their values being specified by means of a
*     string containing a comma-separated list of the form:
*
*        "attribute1 = value1, attribute2 = value2, ... "
*
*     Here, "attribute" specifies an attribute name and the value to
*     the right of each "=" sign should be a suitable textual
*     representation of the value to be assigned to that
*     attribute. This will be interpreted according to the attribute's
*     data type.
*
*     The string supplied may also contain "printf"-style format
*     specifiers identified by a "%" sign in the usual way. If
*     present, these will be substituted by values supplied as
*     optional arguments (as a va_list variable argument list), using
*     the normal "printf" rules, before the string is used.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Object.
*     settings
*        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing a
*        comma-separated list of attribute settings.
*     args
*        The variable argument list which contains values to be
*        substituted for any "printf"-style format specifiers that
*        appear in the "settings" string.

*  Notes:
*     - Attribute names are not case sensitive.
*     - White space may surround attribute names and will be ignored.
*     - White space may also surround attribute values where it will
*     be ignored (except for string-valued attributes where it is
*     significant and forms part of the value to be assigned).
*     - After this function has substituted values for "printf"-style
*     format specifiers it splits the "settings" string into
*     individual attribute settings which it passes one at a time to
*     the protected astSetAttrib method (after removal of white space
*     and conversion of attribute names to lower case). The
*     astSetAttrib method should therefore be extended by derived
*     classes which define new attributes, and this will allow the
*     astVSet (and astSet) methods to have access to those attributes.
*     - This function provides the same functionality as the astSet
*     public method but accepts a va_list variable argument list
*     instead of a variable number of arguments. It is provided for
*     use by functions in other class implementations which accept a
*     variable number of arguments and must therefore pass their
*     argument list to this method in va_list form.

*     ID

*  Purpose:
*     Object identification string.

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     String.

*  Description:
*     This attribute contains a string which may be used to identify
*     the Object to which it is attached. There is no restriction on
*     the contents of this string, which is not used internally by the
*     AST library, and is simply returned without change when
*     required. The default value is an empty string.
*
*     An identification string can be valuable when, for example,
c     several Objects have been stored in a file (using astWrite) and
f     several Objects have been stored in a file (using AST_WRITE) and
c     are later retrieved (using astRead). Consistent use of the ID
f     are later retrieved (using AST_READ). Consistent use of the ID
*     attribute allows the retrieved Objects to be identified without
*     depending simply on the order in which they were stored.
*
*     This attribute may also be useful during debugging, to
c     distinguish similar Objects when using astShow to display them.
f     distinguish similar Objects when using AST_SHOW to display them.

*  Applicability:
*     Object
*        All Objects have this attribute.

*  Notes:
*     - Unlike most other attributes, the value of the ID attribute is
*     not transferred when an Object is copied. Instead, its value is
*     undefined (and therefore defaults to an empty string) in any
*     copy. However, it is retained in any external representation of
c     an Object produced by the astWrite function.

*  Purpose:
*     Use default values for unspecified attributes?

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     Integer (boolean).

*  Description:
*     This attribute specifies whether default values should be used
*     internally for object attributes which have not been assigned a 
*     value explicitly. If a non-zero value (the default) is supplied for 
*     UseDefs, then default values will be used for attributes which have 
*     not explicitly been assigned a value. If zero is supplied for UseDefs, 
*     then an error will be reported if an attribute for which no explicit 
*     value has been supplied is needed internally within AST. 
*
*     Many attributes (including the UseDefs attribute itself) are unaffected 
*     by the setting of the UseDefs attribute, and default values will always 
*     be used without error for such attributes. The "Applicability:" section 
*     below lists the attributes which are affected by the setting of UseDefs.

*     Note, UseDefs only affects access to attributes internally within
*     AST. The public accessor functions such as 
c     astGetC
f     AST_GETC
*     is unaffected by the UseDefs attribute - default values will always
*     be returned if no value has been set. Application code should use the
c     astTest
f     AST_TEST
*     function if required to determine if a value has been set for an
*     attribute.

*  Applicability:
*     Object
*        All Objects have this attribute, but ignore its setting except
*        as described below for individual classes.
*     FrameSet
*        The default value of UseDefs for a FrameSet is redefined to be
*        the UseDefs value of its current Frame.
*     CmpFrame
*        The default value of UseDefs for a CmpFrame is redefined to be
*        the UseDefs value of its first component Frame.
*     Region
*        The default value of UseDefs for a Region is redefined to be
*        the UseDefs value of its encapsulated Frame.
*     Frame
*        If UseDefs is zero, an error is reported when aligning Frames if the 
*        Epoch attribute is required but has not been assigned a value 
*        explicitly.
*     SkyFrame
*        If UseDefs is zero, an error is reported when aligning SkyFrames 
*        if any of the following attributes are required but have not been 
*        assigned a value explicitly: Epoch, Equinox.
*     SpecFrame

*        if any of the following attributes are required but have not been

*  Applicability:

*  Notes:
c     - Every AST class provides a function (astIsA<Class>) of this

*        This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the Object data
*        (sizeof(Object)) plus any data used by the derived class. If a value

*        allocating memory.
*     init
*        A logical flag indicating if the Object's virtual function table is

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This function implements the external (public) interface to the

*  Notes:

*  Synopsis:

*  Class Membership:
*     Object member function.

*  Description:
*     This function takes a zero-based offset into the "handles" array
*     that identifies a Handle associated with an active Object. It
*     encodes this into an identifier value to be issued to an
*     external user to identify that Handle and its Object, and then
*     associates this identifier value with the Handle.

*  Parameters:
*     ihandle
*        Offset in the "handles" array that identifies the Handle,
*        which should be active (i.e. associated with an active
*        Object). This function will modify the "check" field in this
*        Handle to associate it with the identifier value it returns.

*  Returned Value:
*     The resulting identifier value.

*  Notes:
*     - The returned identifier value is, in fact, an int.  This
*     allows the value to be passed easily to other languages
*     (e.g. Fortran) and stored as an integer without loss of
*     information.
*     - The value is stored within C code as type AstObject*.  This
*     means that C code (e.g. function prototypes, etc.) need not be
*     aware that an identifier (as opposed to an Object pointer) is
*     being used, even though the actual bit patterns will be
*     different. The same C code can then be used for both internal
*     and external purposes so long as care is taken to convert
*     between the two representations at appropriate points.
*     - The reverse operation (conversion of an ID back to a handle
*     offset) is performed by CheckId.
*     - A zero identifier value will be returned if this function is
*     invoked with the global status set or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*     astDelete method. It accepts an active Object identifier and
*     deletes the associated Object. Before doing so, it annuls all
*     active identifiers associated with the object, deactivates their
*     Handles and returns these Handles to the free Handles list for
*     re-use.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        An identifier for the Object to be deleted.

*  Returned Value:
*     A NULL C pointer is always returned (this should be translated
*     into an identifier value of zero for external use).

*  Notes:
*     - This function attempts to execute even if the global error
*     status is set.
*     - The identifier supplied should be associated with an active
*     Object, otherwise an error will result (but no error report will
*     be made if the global error status has already been set).
*     - Although this function is documented as "private" and should
*     not be invoked directly from outside this class, it is not a
*     static function and has a public prototype. This is because it
*     must be invoked via the astDelete macro (defined in the
*     "object.h" include file) as part of the public interface.

*  Description:
*     This function inserts a Handle structure into a doubly linked
*     list of such structures composed of elements drawn from the
*     "handles" array. The new list member is inserted in front of the
*     member previously occupying the "head of list" position.

*        Offset in the "handles" array that identifies the handle to
*        be added to the list.
*     head
*        Address of an int which holds the offset in the "handles"
*        array of the element at the head of the list (or -1 if the
*        list is empty). This value will be updated to identify the
*        new list member.

*  Notes:
*     - This function does not perform error chacking and does not
*     generate errors.
*     - The lists generated by this function use integer offsets into
*     the "handles" array for their links, rather than pointers. This
*     is because the array may be re-located in memory when it needs
*     to be extended, so pointers to its element would not remain
*     valid.
*     - The list elements are drawn from the "handles" array in the
*     first place so that they can be addressed by small integers (the
*     offset in the array). This allows references to Handles to be
*     encoded along with security information into an integer that is
*     sufficiently short to be exported to other languages
*     (e.g. Fortran) which might not be able to accommodate
*     full-length C pointers.

*
*     These functions should be used to avoid any dependency on

*  Returned Value:
*     The extracted Object identifier value as an integer (int).

*  Notes:

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "object.h"
*     void RemoveHandle( int ihandle, int *head )

*  Class Membership:
*     Object member function.

*  Description:
*     This function removes a Handle structure from a doubly linked
*     list of such structures composed of elements drawn from the
*     "handles" array. The "head of list" position is updated if
*     necessary.

*  Parameters:
*     ihandle
*        Offset in the "handles" array that identifies the Handle to
*        be removed from the list (note that the Handle must actually
*        be in the list, although this function does not check this).
*     head
*        Address of an int which holds the offset in the "handles"
*        array of the element at the head of the list. This value will
*        be updated if necessary to identify the new list head (or set
*        to -1 if removing the Handle causes the list to become
*        empty).

*  Notes:
*     - This function does not perform error chacking and does not
*     generate errors.
*     - See the InsertHandle function for details of how and why lists
*     of Handles are constructed.

*  Description:

*  Parameters:

*        any "printf"-style format specifiers that appear in the
*        "settings" string.

*  Notes:
*     - Because this function has a variable argument list, it is
*     invoked by a macro that evaluates to a function pointer (not a
*     function invocation) and no checking or casting of arguments is
*     performed before the function is invoked. Because of this, the
*     Object identifier is of type (void *) and is converted and
*     validated within the function itself.

*  Synopsis:

c     int astEscapes( int new_value )
f     RESULT = AST_ESCAPES( NEWVAL, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Object class function.

*  Description:
*     The Plot class defines a set of escape sequences which can be
*     included within a text string in order to control the appearance of
*     sub-strings within the text. See the Escape attribute for a
*     description of these escape sequences. It is usually inappropriate 
*     for AST to return strings containing such escape sequences when
*     called by application code. For instance, an application which
*     displays the value of the Title attribute of a Frame usually does
*     not want the displayed string to include potentially long escape 
*     sequences which a human read would have difficuly interpreting.
*     Therefore the default behaviour is for AST to strip out such escape
*     sequences when called by application code. This default behaviour
*     can be changed using this function.

*  Parameters:
c     new_value
f     NEWVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        A flag which indicates if escapes sequences should be included
*        in returned strings. If zero is supplied, escape sequences will 
*        be stripped out of all strings returned by any AST function. If 
*        a positive value is supplied, then any escape sequences will be 
*        retained in the value returned to the caller. If a negative
*        value is supplied, the current value of the flag will be left 
*        unchanged.

*  Returned Value:
c     astEscapes
f     AST_ESCAPES = INTEGER
*        The value of the flag on entry to this function.

*  Applicability:
*     Object
c        This macro applies to all Objects.

*     - This function attempts to execute even if an error has already
*     occurred.
