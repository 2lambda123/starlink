*  History:
*     2-JAN-1996 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     26-JAN-1996 (RFWS):
*        Removed trailing underscores from static functions and
*        changed to use new error function interfaces.
*     20-JUN-1996 (RFWS):
*        Added astString.
*     15-JUL-1996 (RFWS):

*  Type:

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "memory.h"
*     void *astGrow( void *ptr, int n, size_t size )

*  Description:
*     This function allocates memory in which to store an array of
*     data whose eventual size is unknown. It should be invoked
*     whenever a new array size is determined and will appropriately
*     increase the amount of memory allocated when necessary. In
*     general, it will over-allocate in anticipation of future growth
*     so that the amount of memory does not need adjusting on every
*     invocation.

*  Parameters:
*     ptr
*        Pointer to previously allocated memory (or NULL if none has
*        yet been allocated).
*     n
*        Number of array elements to be stored (may be zero).
*     size
*        The size of each array element.

*  Returned Value:
*     If the memory was allocated successfully, a pointer to the start
*     of the possibly new memory region is returned (this may be the
*     same as the original pointer).

*  Notes:
*     - When new memory is allocated, the existing contents are preserved.
*     - This function does not free memory once it is allocated, so
*     the size allocated grows to accommodate the maximum size of the
*     array (or "high water mark"). Other memory handling routines may
*     be used to free the memory (or alter its size) if necessary.
*     - If this function is invoked with the global error status set,
*     or if it fails for any reason, the original pointer value is
*     returned and the memory contents are unchanged.
*     - This function is documented as protected because it should not
*     be invoked by external code. However, it is available via the
*     external C interface so that it may be used when writing (e.g.)
*     foreign language or graphics interfaces.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "memory.h"
*     int IsDynamic( void *ptr )

*  Description:
*     This function takes a pointer to a region of memory and tests if
*     the memory has previously been dynamically allocated using other
*     functions from this module. It does this by checking for the
*     presence of a "magic" number in the header which precedes the
*     allocated memory. If the magic number is not present (or the
*     pointer is invalid for any other reason), an error is reported
*     and the global error status is set.

*  Parameters:
*     ptr
*        Pointer to the start (as known to the external user) of the
*        dynamically allocated memory.

*  Returned Value:
*     If the memory was allocated dynamically, a value of 1 is
*     returned.  Otherwise, zero is returned and an error results.

*  Notes:
*     - A NULL pointer value produces an error report from this
*     function, although other functions may wish to regard a NULL
*     pointer as valid.
*     - This function attempts to execute even if the global error
*     status is set, although no further error report will be made if
*     the memory is not dynamically allocated under these
*     circumstances.
*     - The test performed by this function is not 100% secure as the
*     "magic" value could occur by accident (although this is
*     unlikely). It is mainly intended to provide security against
*     programming errors, including accidental corruption of the
*     memory header and attempts to allocate the same region of memory
*     more than once.

*     (against memory leaks, etc.) and with error reporting. It also

*  Returned Value:
*     If successful, the function returns a pointer to the start of

*  Synopsis:

*  Description:
*     This function changes the size of a dynamically allocated region
*     of memory, preserving its contents up to the minimum of the old
*     and new sizes. This may involve copying the contents to a new
*     location, so a new pointer is returned (and the old memory freed
*     if necessary).
*
*     This function is similar to the standard C "realloc" function
*     except that it provides better security against programming
*     errors and also supports the allocation of zero-size memory
*     regions (indicated by a NULL pointer).

*  Parameters:
*     ptr
*        Pointer to previously allocated memory (or NULL if the
*        previous size of the allocated memory was zero).
*     size
*        New size required for the memory region. This may be zero, in
*        which case a NULL pointer is returned (no error results). It
*        should not be negative.

*  Returned Value:
*     If the memory was reallocated successfully, a pointer to the
*     start of the new memory region is returned (this may be the same
*     as the original pointer). If size was given as zero, a NULL
*     pointer is returned.

*  Notes:
*     - If this function is invoked with the error status set, or if
*     it fails for any reason, the original pointer value is returned
*     and the memory contents are unchanged. Note that this behaviour
*     differs from that of the standard C "realloc" function which

*     - This is a convenience function for use when storing data of

/*
*+
*  Name:
*     astString

*  Purpose:
*     Create a C string from an array of characters.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "memory.h"
*     char *astString( const char *chars, int nchars )

*  Description:
*     This function allocates memory to hold a C string and fills the
*     string with the sequence of characters supplied. It then
*     terminates the string with a null character and returns a
*     pointer to its start. The memory used for the string may later
*     be de-allocated using astFree.
*
*     This function is intended for constructing null terminated C
*     strings from arrays of characters which are not null terminated,
*     such as when importing a character argument from a Fortran 77
*     program.

*  Parameters:
*     chars
*        Pointer to the array of characters to be used to fill the string.
*     nchars
*        The number of characters in the array (zero or more).

*  Returned Value:
*     If successful, the function returns a pointer to the start of
*     the allocated string. If the number of characters is zero, a
*     zero-length string is still allocated and a pointer to it is
*     returned.

*  Notes:
*     - A pointer value of NULL is returned if this function is
*     invoked with the global error status set or if it fails for any
*     reason.
*     - This function is documented as protected because it should not
*     be invoked by external code. However, it is available via the
*     external C interface so that it may be used when writing (e.g.)
*     foreign language or graphics interfaces.

*  Name:

*  Purpose:
*     Create an array of C strings from an array of characters.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "memory.h"
*     char **astStringArray( const char *chars, int nel, int len ) 

*  Description:
*     This function turns an array of fixed-length character data into
*     a dynamicllay allocated array of null-terminated C strings with
*     an index array that may be used to access them.
*
*     The array of character data supplied is assumed to hold "nel"
*     adjacent fixed-length strings (without terminating nulls), each
*     of length "len" characters. This function allocates memory and
*     creates a null-terminated copy of each of these strings. It also
*     creates an array of "nel" pointers which point at the start of
*     each of these new strings. A pointer to this index array is
*     returned.
*
*     The memory used is allocated in a single block and should later
*     be de-allocated using astFree.
s
*  Parameters:
*     chars
*        Pointer to the array of input characters. The number of characters
*        in this array should be at least equal to (nel * len).
*     nel
*        The number of fixed-length strings in the input character
*        array. This may be zero but should not be negative.
*     len
*        The number of characters in each fixed-length input
*        string. This may be zero but should not be negative.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the start of the index array, which contains "nel"
*     pointers pointing at the start of each null-terminated output
*     string.
*
*     The returned pointer should be passed to astFree to de-allocate
*     the memory used when it is no longer required. This will free
*     both the index array and the memory used by the strings it
*     points at.

*  Notes:
*     - A NULL pointer will also be returned if the value of "nel" is
*     zero, in which case no memory is allocated.
*     - A pointer value of NULL will also be returned if this function
*     is invoked with the global error status set or if it fails for
*     any reason.
*     - This function is documented as protected because it should not
*     be invoked by external code. However, it is available via the
*     external C interface so that it may be used when writing (e.g.)
