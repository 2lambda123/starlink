\section{Introduction}

Welcome to the AST library. If you are writing software for astronomy
and need to use celestial coordinates ({\em{e.g.}}\ RA and Dec) or
other coordinate system information, then this library should be of
interest. It provides solutions for most of the problems you will meet
and allows you to write robust and flexible software.

%\subsection{TBW---What is a World Coordinate \htmlref{System}{System}?}

\subsection{What Problems Does AST Tackle?}

Here are some of the main problems you may face when handling world
coordinate system (WCS) information and the solutions that AST
provides:

\begin{description}
\item[1. The Variety of Coordinate Systems]\mbox{}\\
There are a large number of celestial coordinate systems in use in
astronomy. Understanding these, and knowing how to convert coordinates
between them, requires considerable expertise. It can also be
difficult to decide which of them your software should support.

{\bf{Solution.}} AST has built-in knowledge of many coordinate systems
and allows you to convert freely between them without specialist
knowledge. This avoids the need to embed details of specific
coordinate systems in your software. You also benefit automatically
when new coordinate systems are added to AST.

\item[2. Storing and Retrieving WCS Information]\mbox{}\\
Storing coordinate system information in astronomical datasets and
retrieving it later can present a considerable challenge. Typically,
it requires knowledge of rather complex conventions
({\em{e.g.}}\ FITS) which are low-level, often mis-interpreted and may
be subject to change. Exchanging information with other software
systems is further complicated by the number of different conventions
in use.

{\bf{Solution.}} AST combines a unifying high-level description of WCS
information with the ability to save and restore this using a variety
of formats. Details of the formats, which include FITS, are handled
internally by AST. This frees you from the need to understand them or
embed the details in your software. Again, you benefit automatically
when new formats are added to AST.

\item[3. Generating Graphical Output]\mbox{}\\
Producing graphical displays involving curvilinear coordinate systems,
such as celestial coordinate grids, can be complicated. Particular
difficulties arise when handling large areas of sky, the polar regions
and discontinuous ({\em{e.g.}}\ segmented) sky projections.  Even just
numbering and labelling curvilinear axes is rarely straightforward.

{\bf{Solution.}} AST provides plotting facilities especially designed
for use with curvilinear coordinate systems. These include the
plotting of axes and complete labelled coordinate grids.  A large
number of options are provided for tailoring the output to your
specific needs.

\item[4. Aligning Data from Different Sources]\mbox{}\\
One of the main uses of coordinate systems is to facilitate the
inter-comparison of data from different sources. A typical use might
be to plot (say) radio contours over an optical image.  In practice,
however, different celestial coordinate systems may have been used,
making accurate alignment far from simple.

{\bf{Solution}} AST provides a one-step method of aligning datasets,
searching for all possible intermediate coordinate systems.  This
makes it simple to directly inter-relate the pixel coordinates of
different datasets.

\item[5. Handling Different Types of Coordinate Sy\mbox{}stem]\mbox{}\\
Not all coordinate systems used in astronomy are celestial ones, so if
you are writing general-purpose software such as (say) a display tool,
you may also need to handle axes representing wavelength, distance,
time or whatever else comes along. Obviously, you would prefer not to
handle each one as a special case.

{\bf{Solution}} AST uses the same flexible high-level model to
describe all types of coordinate system. This allows you to write
software that handles different kinds of coordinate axis without
introducing special cases.
\end{description}

\subsection{Other Design Objectives}

As well as its scientific objectives, the AST library's design
includes a number of technical criteria intended to make it applicable
to as wide a range of projects as possible. The main considerations
are described here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf{Minimum Software Dependencies.}}
The AST library depends on as little other software as possible. Only
the widely-available SLALIB positional astronomy library
(\xref{SUN/67}{sun67}{}) is required. Even here, you have the choice
of using either the Fortran or the C version.

\item {\bf{Environment Independence.}}
AST is designed so that it can operate in a variety of ``programming
environments'' and is not tied to any particular one. To allow this,
it uses simple, flexible interfaces to obtain the following services:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf{Data Storage.}} Data I/O operations are based on text
and/or FITS headers. This makes it easy to interface to a wide variety
of astronomical data formats in a machine-independent way.

\item {\bf{Graphics.}} Graphical output is produced {\em{via}} a
simple generic graphics interface, which may easily be re-implemented
over different graphics systems. AST provides a default implementation
based on the widely-used PGPLOT graphics system
(\xref{SUN/15}{sun15}{}).

\item {\bf{Error Handling.}} Error messages are written to standard
error by default, but go through a simple generic interface similar to
that used for graphics (above). This permits error message delivery
{\em{via}} other routes when necessary ({\em{e.g.}} in a graphical
interface).
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf{Multiple Language Support.}}
AST has been designed to be called from more than one language.
Both C and Fortran interfaces are available (see
\xref{SUN/210}{sun210}{} for the Fortran version)
and use from C$++$ is also straightforward if the C interface is
included using:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
extern "C" {
#include "ast.h"
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

\item {\bf{Ob\mbox{}ject Oriented Design.}}
AST uses ``object oriented'' techniques internally in order to provide
a flexible and easily-extended programming model.  A fairly
traditional calling interface is provided, however, so that the
library's facilities are easily accessible to programmers using
C and Fortran.

\item {\bf{Portability.}}
AST is implemented entirely in ANSI standard C and, when called
{\em{via}} its C interface, makes no explicit use of any
machine-dependent facilities.

The Fortran interface is, unavoidably, machine dependent. However, the
potential for problems has been minimised by encapsulating the
interface layer in a compact set of C macros which facilitate its
transfer to other platforms. No Fortran compiler is needed to build
the library.

Currently, AST is supported by Starlink on PC~Linux, Sun~Solaris and
Tru64~Unix (formerly DEC~UNIX) platforms.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What Does ``AST'' Stand For?}

The library name ``AST'' stands for ``ASTrometry Library''. The name
arose when it was thought that knowledge of ``astrometry''
({\em{i.e.}}\ celestial coordinate systems) would form the bulk of the
library.  In fact, it turns out that astrometry forms only a minor
component, but the name AST has stuck.

\section{Overview of AST Concepts}

This section presents a brief overview of AST concepts. It is intended
as a basic orientation course before you move on to the more technical
considerations in subsequent sections.

\subsection{\label{ss:mappingoverview}Relationships Between Coordinate Systems}

The relationships between coordinate systems are represented in AST by
Objects called Mappings. A \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} does not represent a coordinate
system itself, but merely the process by which you move from one
coordinate system to another related one.
 
\begin{latexonly}
   A convenient picture of a Mapping is as a ``black box''
   (Figure~\ref{fig:mapping}) into which you can feed sets of
   coordinates.
   \begin{figure}[bhtp]
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{sun211_figures/mapping.eps}
   \caption{A Mapping viewed as a ``black box'' for transforming coordinates.}
   \label{fig:mapping}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   A convenient picture of a Mapping is as a ``black box'' (see Figure
   below) into which you can feed sets of coordinates.
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}[bhtp]
   \label{fig:mapping}
   \includegraphics[scale=1.2]{sun211_figures/mapping.eps}
   \caption{A Mapping viewed as a ``black box'' for transforming coordinates.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}
For each set you feed in, the Mapping returns a corresponding set of
transformed coordinates. Since each set of coordinates represents a
point in a coordinate space, the Mapping acts to inter-relate
corresponding positions in the two spaces, although what these spaces
represent is unspecified.  Notice that a Mapping need not have the
same number of input and output coordinates. That is, the two
coordinate spaces which it inter-relates need not have the same number
of dimensions.

In many cases, the transformation can, in principle, be performed in
either direction: either from the {\em{input}} coordinate space to the
{\em{output,}} or {\em{vice versa.}} The first of these is termed the
{\em{forward}} transformation and the other the {\em{inverse}}
transformation.

{\bf{Further reading:}} For a more complete discussion of Mappings,
see~\secref{ss:mappings}.

\subsection{\label{ss:mappingselection}Mappings Available}

The basic concept of a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} (\secref{ss:mappingoverview}) is rather
generic and obviously it is necessary to have specific Mappings that
implement specific relationships between coordinate systems. AST
provides a range of these, to perform transformations such as the
following and, where appropriate, their inverses:

\begin{itemize}
\item Conversions between various celestial coordinate systems (the
\htmlref{SlaMap}{SlaMap}).

\item Conversion between 2-dimensional spherical celestial coordinates
(longitude and latitude) and a 3-dimensional vectorial positions (the \htmlref{SphMap}{SphMap}).

\item Various projections of the celestial sphere on to 2-dimensional
coordinate spaces---{\em{i.e.}}\ map projections (the \htmlref{DssMap}{DssMap} and \htmlref{WcsMap}{WcsMap}).

\item Permutation, introduction and elimination of coordinates (the
\htmlref{PermMap}{PermMap}).

\item Various linear coordinate transformations (the \htmlref{MatrixMap}{MatrixMap}, \htmlref{WinMap}{WinMap}
and \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap}).

\item Lookup tables (the \htmlref{LutMap}{LutMap}).

\item General-purpose transformations expressed using arithmetic
operations and functions similar to those available in C (the
\htmlref{MathMap}{MathMap}).

\item Transformations for internal use within a program, based on
private transformation functions which you write yourself in C (the
\htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap}).
\end{itemize}

{\bf{Further reading:}} For a more complete description of each of the
Mappings mentioned above, see its entry in
\appref{ss:classdescriptions}. In addition, see the discussion of the
PermMap in \secref{ss:permmapexample}, the \htmlref{UnitMap}{UnitMap} in
\secref{ss:unitmapexample} and the IntraMap in
\secref{ss:intramaps}. The ZoomMap is used as an example throughout
\secref{ss:primer}.

\subsection{\label{ss:cmpmapoverview}Compound Mappings}

The Mappings described in \secref{ss:mappingselection} provide a set
of basic building blocks from which more complex Mappings may be
constructed. The key to doing this is a type of \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} called a
\htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap}, or compound Mapping.  A CmpMap's role is, in principle, very
simple: it allows any other pair of Mappings to be joined together
into a single entity which behaves as if it were a single Mapping. A
CmpMap is therefore a container for another pair of Mappings.

\begin{latexonly}
   A pair of Mappings may be combined using a CmpMap in either of two
   ways. The first of these, {\em{in series,}} is illustrated in
   Figure~\ref{fig:seriescmpmap}.
   \begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{sun211_figures/series.eps}
   \caption{A CmpMap (compound Mapping) composed of two component
   Mappings joined in series. The output coordinates of the first Mapping
   feed into the input coordinates of the second one, so that the whole
   entity behaves like a single Mapping.}
   \label{fig:seriescmpmap}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   A pair of Mappings may be combined using a CmpMap in either of two
   ways. The first of these, {\em{in series,}} is illustrated in the
   following Figure.
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}
   \label{fig:seriescmpmap}
   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{sun211_figures/series.eps}
   \caption{A CmpMap (compound Mapping) composed of two component
   Mappings joined in series. The output coordinates of the first Mapping
   feed into the input coordinates of the second one, so that the whole
   entity behaves like a single Mapping.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
   Here, the transformations implemented by each component Mapping are
   performed one after the other, with the output from the first Mapping
   feeding into the second.  The second way, {\em{in parallel,}} is shown in
   Figure~\ref{fig:parallelcmpmap}.
   \begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{sun211_figures/parallel.eps}
   \caption{A CmpMap composed of two Mappings joined in parallel. Each
   component Mapping acts on a complementary subset of the input and
   output coordinates.}
   \label{fig:parallelcmpmap}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   Here, the transformations implemented by each component Mapping are
   performed one after the other, with the output from the first Mapping
   feeding into the second.  The second way, {\em{in parallel,}} is shown in
   the Figure below.
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}
   \label{fig:parallelcmpmap}
   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{sun211_figures/parallel.eps}
   \caption{A CmpMap composed of two Mappings joined in parallel. Each
   component Mapping acts on a complementary subset of the input and
   output coordinates.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}
In this case, each Mapping acts on a complementary subset of the
input and output coordinates.

\begin{latexonly}
   The CmpMap forms the key to building arbitrarily complex Mappings
   because it is itself a form of Mapping. This means that a CmpMap may
   contain other CmpMaps as components
   ({\em{e.g.}}\ Figure~\ref{fig:complexcmpmap}). This nesting of CmpMaps
   can be repeated indefinitely, so that complex Mappings may be built in
   a hierarchical manner out of simper ones.

   \caption{CmpMaps (compound Mappings) may be nested in order to
   construct complex Mappings out of simpler building blocks.}
   \label{fig:complexcmpmap}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
   This gives AST great flexibility in the coordinate transformations it
   can describe.

\subsection{Representing Coordinate Systems}

\begin{latexonly}
   While Mappings (\secref{ss:mappingoverview}) represent the
   relationships between coordinate systems in AST, the coordinate
   systems themselves are represented by Objects called Frames
   (Figure~\ref{fig:frames}).
   \begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{sun211_figures/frames.eps}
   \caption{(a) A basic \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} is used to represent a Cartesian coordinate
   system, here 2-dimensional. (b) A \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} represents a (spherical)
   celestial coordinate system. (c) The axis order of any Frame may be
   permuted to match the coordinate space it describes.}
   \label{fig:frames}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   While Mappings (\secref{ss:mappingoverview}) represent the
   relationships between coordinate systems in AST, the coordinate
   systems themselves are represented by Objects called Frames (see
   Figure below).
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}
   \label{fig:frames}
   \includegraphics[scale=1.5]{sun211_figures/frames.eps}
   \caption{(a) A basic Frame is used to represent a Cartesian coordinate
   system, here 2-dimensional. (b) A SkyFrame represents a (spherical)
   celestial coordinate system. (c) The axis order of any Frame may be

   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}
A Frame is similar in concept to the frame you might draw around a
graph.  It contains information about the labels which appear on the
axes, the axis units, a title, knowledge of how to format the
coordinate values on each axis, {\em{etc.}}  An AST Frame is not,
however, restricted to two dimensions and may have any number of axes.

A basic Frame may be used to represent a Cartesian coordinate system
by setting values for its {\em attributes} (all AST Objects have
values associated with them called attributes, which may be set and
enquired).  Usually, this would involve setting appropriate axis
labels and units, for example.  Functions are provided for use with
Frames to perform operations such as formatting coordinate values as
text, calculating distances between points, interchanging axes,
{\em{etc.}}

A more specialised form of Frame, the SkyFrame
(Figure~\ref{fig:frames}b,c), is provided to represent celestial
coordinate systems, of which a wide range are supported.  These may be
selected by setting appropriate SkyFrame attributes.  A SkyFrame
provides the additional functionality required when handling celestial
coordinates---such as sexagesimal formatting and great circle
distances.  It also encapsulates knowledge of how to convert between
any pair of celestial coordinate systems.

\begin{latexonly}
   As with compound Mappings (\secref{ss:cmpmapoverview}), it is possible
   to merge two Frames together to form a compound Frame, or \htmlref{CmpFrame}{CmpFrame}, in
   which both sets of axes are combined.  One could, for example, have
   celestial coordinates on two axes and an unrelated coordinate
   (wavelength, perhaps) on a third (Figure~\ref{fig:cmpframe}).
   Knowledge of the relationships between the axes is preserved
   internally by the process of constructing the CmpFrame which
   represents them.
   \begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.85]{sun211_figures/cmpframe.eps}
   \caption{A CmpFrame (compound Frame) formed by combining two simpler

   order to build more complex Frames.}

\secref{ss:frames} and for SkyFrames see \secref{ss:skyframes}.  Also
see the Frame, SkyFrame and CmpFrame entries in
\appref{ss:classdescriptions}.

\subsection{Networks of Coordinate Systems}

\begin{latexonly}
   Mappings and Frames may be connected together to form networks called
   FrameSets, which are used to represent sets of inter-related
   coordinate systems (Figure~\ref{fig:frameset}).
   \begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{sun211_figures/frameset.eps}
   \caption{A \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} is a network of Frames inter-connected by Mappings
   such that there is exactly one conversion path, {\em{via}} Mappings,
   between any pair of Frames.}
   \label{fig:frameset}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   Mappings and Frames may be connected together to form networks called
   FrameSets, which are used to represent sets of inter-related
   coordinate systems (see Figure below).
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}
   \label{fig:frameset}
   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{sun211_figures/frameset.eps}
   \caption{A FrameSet is a network of Frames inter-connected by Mappings
   such that there is exactly one conversion path, {\em{via}} Mappings,
   between any pair of Frames.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}
A FrameSet may be extended by adding a new \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} to it, together with
an associated \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which relates the new coordinate system to one
which is already present.  This process ensures that there is always
exactly one path, {\em{via}} Mappings, between any pair of Frames.  A
function is provided for identifying this path and returning the
complete Mapping.

One of the Frames in a FrameSet is termed its {\em{base}} Frame.  This
underlies the FrameSet's purpose, which is to calibrate datasets and
other entities by attaching coordinate systems to them.  In this
context, the base Frame represents the ``native'' coordinate system
(for example, the pixel coordinates of an image).  Similarly, one
Frame is termed the {\em{current}} Frame and represents the
``currently-selected'' coordinates.  It might, typically, be a
celestial coordinate system and would be used during interactions with
a user, as when plotting axes on a graph or producing a table of
results.  Other Frames within the FrameSet represent a library of
alternative coordinate systems which a software user can select by
making them current.

{\bf{Further reading:}} For a more complete description of
FrameSets, see \secref{ss:framesets} and \secref{ss:fshigher}. Also
see the FrameSet entry in \appref{ss:classdescriptions}.

\subsection{Input/Output Facilities}

AST allows you to convert any kind of \htmlref{Object}{Object} into a stream of text
which contains a full description of that Object. This text may be
written out by one program and read back in by another, thus allowing
the original Object to be reconstructed.

The filter which converts Objects into text and back again is itself a
kind of Object, called a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}. A Channel provides a number of
options for controlling the information content of the text, such as
the addition of comments for human interpretation.  It is also
possible to intercept the text being processed by a Channel so that it
may be redirected to/from any chosen external data store, such as a
text file, an astronomical dataset, or a network connection.

To further facilitate the storage of coordinate system information in
astronomical datasets, a more specialised form of Channel called a
\htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} is provided. Instead of using free-format text, a FitsChan
converts AST Objects to and from FITS header cards. It also allows the
information to be encoded in the FITS cards in a number of ways
(called {\em{encodings}}), so that WCS information from a variety of
sources can be handled.

{\bf{Further reading:}} For a more complete description of Channels
see \secref{ss:channels} and for FitsChans see \secref{ss:nativefits}
and \secref{ss:foreignfits}. Also see the Channel and FitsChan entries
in \appref{ss:classdescriptions} and the \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} entry in
\appref{ss:attributedescriptions}.

\subsection{Producing Graphical Output}

Graphical output is supported by a specialised form of \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} called
a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot}, whose base \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} corresponds with the native coordinates of
the underlying graphics system.  Plotting operations are specified in
{\em{physical coordinates}} which correspond with the Plot's current
Frame. Typically, this might be a celestial coordinate system.

Operations, such as drawing lines, are automatically transformed from
physical to graphical coordinates before plotting, using an adaptive
algorithm which ensures smooth curves (because the transformation is
usually non-linear).  ``Missing'' coordinates ({\em{e.g.}}\ graphical
coordinates which do not project on to the celestial sphere),
discontinuities and generalised clipping are all consistently handled.
It is possible, for example, to plot in equatorial coordinates and
clip in galactic coordinates.  The usual plotting operations are
provided (text, markers), but a geodesic curve replaces the primitive
straight line element.  There is also a separate function for drawing
axis lines, since these are normally not geodesics.

\begin{latexonly}
   Perhaps the most useful graphics function available is for drawing
   fully annotated coordinate grids ({\em{e.g.}}\ Figure~\ref{fig:gridplot}).
   \begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.8,angle=-90]{sun211_figures/gridplot_bw.eps}
   \caption{A labelled coordinate grid for an all-sky zenithal equal area
   projection in ecliptic coordinates. This was composed and drawn
   {\em{via}} a Plot using a
   single function call.}
   \label{fig:gridplot}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   Perhaps the most useful graphics function available is for drawing
   fully annotated coordinate grids ({\em{e.g.}}\ the Figure below).
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}
   \label{fig:gridplot}
   \includegraphics[scale=1.2,angle=-90]{sun211_figures/gridplot.eps}
   \caption{A labelled coordinate grid for an all-sky zenithal equal area
   projection in ecliptic coordinates. This was composed and drawn
   {\em{via}} a Plot using a
   single function call.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}
This uses a general algorithm which does not depend on knowledge of
the coordinates being represented, so can also handle
programmer-defined coordinate systems.  Grids for all-sky projections,
including polar regions, can be drawn and most aspects of the output
(colour, line style, {\em{etc.}}) can be adjusted by setting
appropriate Plot attributes.

Plots and how to produce graphical output, see \secref{ss:plots}. Also

\section{\label{ss:howto}How To\ldots}

For those of you with a plane to catch, this section provides some
instant templates and recipes for performing the most
commonly-required operations using AST, but without going into
detail. The examples given (sort of) follow on from each other, so you
should be able to construct a variety of programs by piecing them
together.  Note that some of them appear longer than they actually
are, because we have included plenty of comments and a few options
that you probably won't need.

If any of this material has you completely baffled, then you may want
to read the introduction to AST programming concepts in
\secref{ss:primer} first. Otherwise, references to more detailed
reading are given after each example, just in case they don't quite do
what you want.

\subsection{\ldots Structure an AST Program}

An AST program normally has the following structure:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
/* Include the interface to the AST library. */
#include "ast.h"

/* Main program (or could be any function). */
main () {
   <normal C declarations and statements>

/* Enclose the parts which use AST between the astBegin and astEnd macros. */
   astBegin;
   <C statements which use AST>
   astEnd;

   <maybe more C statements>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The use of \htmlref{astBegin}{astBegin} and \htmlref{astEnd}{astEnd} is optional, but has the effect of
tidying up after you have finished using AST, so is normally
recommended. For more details of this, see \secref{ss:contexts}. For
details of how to access the ``ast.h'' header file, see
\secref{ss:accessingheaderfile} and the description of the
``\htmlref{ast\_dev}{ast_dev}'' command in \appref{ss:commanddescriptions}.

\subsection{\label{ss:howtobuild}\ldots Build an AST Program}

Before building any AST program, you may want to issue the UNIX command:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
ast_dev
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

which will set up links to the AST include files in your current
directory.  Then, to build a simple AST program that doesn't use
graphics, use:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
cc program.c -L/star/lib `ast_link` -o program
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

To build a program which uses PGPLOT for graphics, use:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
cc program.c -L/star/lib `ast_link -pgplot` -o program
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

For more details about accessing the ``ast.h'' header file, see
\secref{ss:accessingheaderfile} and the description of the
``\htmlref{ast\_dev}{ast_dev}'' command in \appref{ss:commanddescriptions}.  For more
details about linking programs, see \secref{ss:linking} and the
description of the ``\htmlref{ast\_link}{ast_link}'' command in
\appref{ss:commanddescriptions}.

\subsection{\label{ss:howtoreadwcs}\ldots Read a WCS Calibration from a Dataset}

Precisely how you extract world coordinate system (WCS) information
from a dataset obviously depends on what type of dataset it
is. Usually, however, you should be able to obtain a set of FITS
header cards which contain the WCS information (and probably much more
besides). Suppose that ``cards'' is a pointer to an array of strings
containing a complete set of FITS header cards and ``ncard'' is the
number of cards. Then proceed as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFitsChan *fitschan;
AstFrameSet *wcsinfo;
char *cards[ MAXCARD ];
int icard, ncard;

...

/* Create a FitsChan and fill it with FITS header cards. */
fitschan = astFitsChan( NULL, NULL, "" );
for ( icard = 0; icard < ncard; icard++ ) astPutFits( fitschan, cards[ icard ], 0 );

/* Rewind the FitsChan and read WCS information from it. */
astClear( fitschan, "Card" );
wcsinfo = astRead( fitschan );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The result should be a pointer, ``wcsinfo'', to a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} which
contains the WCS information. This pointer can now be used to perform
many useful tasks, some of which are illustrated in the following
recipes.

Some datasets which do not easily yield FITS header cards may require
a different approach, possibly involving use of a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}
(\secref{ss:channels}) rather than a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}. In the case of the
Starlink NDF data format, for example, all the above may be replaced
by a single call to the function
\xref{ndfGtwcs}{sun33}{ndfGtwcs}---see \xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{}.  The
whole process can probably be encapsulated in a similar way for
most data systems, whether they use FITS header cards or not.

For more details about reading WCS information from datasets, see
\secref{ss:identifyingfitsencoding} and
\secref{ss:readingforeignfits}. For a more general description of
FitsChans and their use with FITS header cards, see
\secref{ss:nativefits} and \secref{ss:foreignfits}. For more details
about FrameSets, see \secref{ss:framesets} and \secref{ss:fshigher}.

\subsection{\ldots Validate WCS Information}

Once you have read WCS information from a dataset, as in
\secref{ss:howtoreadwcs}, you may wish to check that you have been
successful. The following will detect and classify the things that
might possibly go wrong:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <string.h>

...

if ( !astOK ) {
   <an error occurred (a message will have been issued)>
} else if ( wcsinfo == AST__NULL ) {
   <there was no WCS information present>
} else if ( strcmp( astGetC( wcsinfo, "Class" ), "FrameSet" ) ) {
   <something unexpected was read (i.e. not a FrameSet)>
} else {
   <WCS information was read OK>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

For more information about detecting errors in AST functions, see
\secref{ss:errordetection}. For details of how to validate input data
read by AST, see \secref{ss:validatinginput} and
\secref{ss:readingforeignfits}.

\subsection{\ldots Display AST Data}

If you have a pointer to any AST \htmlref{Object}{Object}, you can display the data
stored in that Object in textual form as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astShow( wcsinfo );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, we have used a pointer to the \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} which we read earlier
(\secref{ss:howtoreadwcs}).  The result is written to the program's
standard output stream. This can be very useful during debugging.

For more details about using \htmlref{astShow}{astShow}, see
\secref{ss:displayingobjects}. For information about interpreting the
output, also see \secref{ss:textualoutputformat}.

\subsection{\label{ss:howtotransform}\ldots Convert Between Pixel and World Coordinates}

You may use a pointer to a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, such as we read in
\secref{ss:howtoreadwcs}, to transform a set of points between the
pixel coordinates of an image and the associated world coordinates. If
you are working in two dimensions, proceed as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double xpixel[ N ], ypixel[ N ];
double xworld[ N ], yworld[ N ];

...

astTran2( wcsinfo, N, xpixel, ypixel, 1, xworld, yworld );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, N is the number of points to be transformed, ``xpixel'' and
``ypixel'' hold the pixel coordinates, and ``xworld'' and ``yworld''
receive the returned world coordinates.\footnote{By pixel coordinates,
we mean a coordinate system in which the first pixel in the image is
centred on (1,1) and each pixel is a unit square.  Note that the world
coordinates will not necessarily be celestial coordinates, but if they
are, then they will be in radians.}  To transform in the opposite
direction, interchange the two pairs of arrays (so that the world
coordinates are given as input) and change the fifth argument of
\htmlref{astTran2}{astTran2} to zero.

To transform points in one dimension, use \htmlref{astTran1}{astTran1}. In any other
number of dimensions (or if the number of dimensions is initially
unknown), use \htmlref{astTranN}{astTranN} or \htmlref{astTranP}{astTranP}. These functions are described in
\appref{ss:functiondescriptions}.

For more information about transforming coordinates, see
\secref{ss:transforming} and \secref{ss:framesetasmapping}. For
details of how to handle missing coordinates, see
\secref{ss:badcoordinates}.

\subsection{\label{ss:howtotestforcelestial}\ldots Test if a WCS is a Celestial Coordinate System}

The world coordinate system (WCS) currently associated with an image
may often be a celestial coordinate system, but this need not
necessarily be the case. For instance, instead of right ascension and
declination, an image might have a WCS with axes representing
wavelength and slit position, or maybe just plain old pixels.

If you have obtained a WCS calibration for an image, as in
\secref{ss:howtoreadwcs}, in the form of a pointer ``wcsinfo'' to a
\htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, then you may determine if the current coordinate system is a
celestial one or not, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFrame *frame;
int issky;

...

/* Obtain a pointer to the current Frame and determine if it is a
   SkyFrame. */
frame = astGetFrame( wcsinfo, AST__CURRENT );
issky = astIsASkyFrame( frame );
frame = astAnnul( frame );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This will set ``issky'' to 1 if the WCS is a celestial coordinate
system, and to zero otherwise.

\subsection{\label{ss:howtoformatcoordinates}\ldots Format Coordinates for Display}

Once you have converted pixel coordinates into world coordinates
(\secref{ss:howtotransform}), you may want to format them as text
before displaying them. Typically, this would convert from (say)
radians into something more comprehensible. Using the \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} pointer
``wcsinfo'' obtained in \secref{ss:howtoreadwcs} and a pair of world
coordinates ``xw'' and ``yw'' ({\em{e.g.}}\ see
\secref{ss:howtotransform}), you could proceed as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>
const char *xtext, *ytext;
double xw, yw;

...

xtext = astFormat( wcsinfo, 1, xw );
ytext = astFormat( wcsinfo, 2, yw );

(void) printf( "Position = %s, %s\n", xtext, ytext );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, the second argument to \htmlref{astFormat}{astFormat} is the axis number.

With celestial coordinates, this will usually result in sexagesimal
notation, such as ``12:34:56.7''. However, the same method may be
applied to any type of coordinates and appropriate formatting will be
employed.

For more information about formatting coordinate values and how to
control the style of formatting used, see
\secref{ss:formattingaxisvalues} and
\secref{ss:formattingskyaxisvalues}. If necessary, also see
\secref{ss:normalising} for details of how to ``normalise'' a set of
coordinates so that they lie within the standard range ({\em{e.g.}}\ 0
to 24 hours for right ascension and $\pm 90^\circ$ for
declination).

\subsection{\ldots Display Coordinates as they are Transformed}

In addition to formatting coordinates as part of a program's output,
you may also want to examine coordinate values while debugging your
program. To save time, you can ``eavesdrop'' on the coordinate values
being processed every time they are transformed. For example, when
using the \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} pointer ``wcsinfo'' obtained in
\secref{ss:howtoreadwcs} to transform coordinates
(\secref{ss:howtotransform}), you could inspect the coordinate values
as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( wcsinfo, "Report=1" );
astTran2( wcsinfo, N, xpixel, ypixel, 1, xworld, yworld );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

By setting the FrameSet's \htmlref{Report}{Report} attribute to 1, coordinate
transformations are automatically displayed on the program's standard
output stream, appropriately formatted, for example:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
(42.1087, 20.2717) --> (2:06:03.0, 34:22:39)
(43.0197, 21.1705) --> (2:08:20.6, 35:31:24)
(43.9295, 22.0716) --> (2:10:38.1, 36:40:09)
(44.8382, 22.9753) --> (2:12:55.6, 37:48:55)
(45.7459, 23.8814) --> (2:15:13.1, 38:57:40)
(46.6528, 24.7901) --> (2:17:30.6, 40:06:25)
(47.5589, 25.7013) --> (2:19:48.1, 41:15:11)
(48.4644, 26.6149) --> (2:22:05.6, 42:23:56)
(49.3695, 27.5311) --> (2:24:23.1, 43:32:41)
(50.2742, 28.4499) --> (2:26:40.6, 44:41:27)
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

For a complete description of the Report attribute, see its entry in
\appref{ss:attributedescriptions}.  For further details of how to set
and enquire attribute values, see \secref{ss:settingattributes} and
\secref{ss:gettingattributes}.

\subsection{\ldots Read Coordinates Entered by a User}

In addition to writing out coordinate values generated by your program
(\secref{ss:howtoformatcoordinates}), you may also need to accept
coordinates entered by a user, or perhaps read from a file. In this
case, you will probably want to allow ``free-format'' input, so that
the user has some flexibility in the format that can be used. You will
probably also want to detect any typing errors.

Let's assume that you want to read a number of lines of text, each
containing the world coordinates of a single point, and to split each
line into individual numerical coordinate values. Using the \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}
pointer ``wcsinfo'' obtained earlier (\secref{ss:howtoreadwcs}), you
could proceed as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>
char *t;
char text[ MAXCHARS + 2 ];
double coord[ 10 ];
int iaxis, n, naxes;

...

/* Obtain the number of coordinate axes (if not already known). */
naxes = astGetI( wcsinfo, "Naxes" );

/* Loop to read each line of input text, in this case from the
   standard input stream (your programming environment will probably
   provide a better way of reading text than this). Set the pointer
   "t" to the start of each line read. */
while ( t = fgets( text, MAXCHARS + 2, stdin ) ) {

/* Attempt to read a coordinate for each axis. */
   for ( iaxis = 1; iaxis <= naxes; iaxis++ ) {
      n = astUnformat( wcsinfo, iaxis, t, &coord[ iaxis - 1 ] );

/* If nothing was read and this is not the first axis or the
   end-of-string, try stepping over a separator and reading again. */
   if ( !n && ( iaxis > 1 ) && *t )
      n = astUnformat( wcsinfo, iaxis, ++t, &coord[ iaxis - 1 ] );

/* Quit if nothing was read, otherwise move on to the next coordinate. */
      if ( !n ) break;
      t += n;
   }

/* Test for the possible errors that may occur... */

/* Error detected by AST (a message will have been issued). */
   if ( !astOK ) {
      break;

/* Error in input data at character t[n]. */
   } else if ( *t || !n ) {
      <handle the error, or report your own message here>
      break;

   } else {
      <coordinates were read OK>
   }
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This algorithm has the advantage of accepting free-format input in
whatever style is appropriate for the world coordinates in use (under
the control of the FrameSet whose pointer you provide). For example,
wavelength values might be read as floating point numbers
({\em{e.g.}}\ ``1.047'' or ``4787''), whereas celestial positions
could be given in sexagesimal format ({\em{e.g.}}\ ``12:34:56'' or
``12~34.5'') and would be converted into radians. Individual
coordinate values may be separated by white space and/or any
non-ambiguous separator character, such as a comma.

For more information on reading coordinate values using the
\htmlref{astUnformat}{astUnformat} function, see \secref{ss:unformattingaxisvalues}. For
details of how sexagesimal formats are handled, and the forms of input
that may be used for celestial coordinates, see
\secref{ss:unformattingskyaxisvalues}.

\subsection{\label{ss:howtomodifywcs}\ldots Modify a WCS Calibration}

The usual reason for wishing to modify the WCS calibration associated
with a dataset is that the data have been geometrically transformed in
some way (here, we will assume a 2-dimensional image dataset). This
causes the image features (stars, galaxies, {\em{etc.}}) to move with
respect to the grid of pixels which they occupy, so that any
coordinate systems previously associated with the image become
invalid.

To correct for this, it is necessary to set up a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which
expresses the positions of image features in the new data grid in
terms of their positions in the old grid. In both cases, the grid
coordinates we use will have the first pixel centred at (1,1) with
each pixel being a unit square.

AST allows you to correct for any type of geometrical transformation
in this way, so long as a suitable Mapping to describe it can be
constructed. For purposes of illustration, we will assume here that
the new image coordinates ``xnew'' and ``ynew'' can be expressed in
terms of the old coordinates ``xold'' and ``yold'' as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double xnew, xold, ynew, yold;
double m[ 4 ], z[ 2 ];

...

xnew = xold * m[ 0 ] + yold * m[ 1 ] + z[ 0 ];
ynew = xold * m[ 2 ] + yold * m[ 3 ] + z[ 1 ];
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

where ``m'' is a 2$\times$2 transformation matrix and ``z'' represents
a shift of origin. This is therefore a general linear coordinate
transformation which can represent displacement, rotation,
magnification and shear.

In AST, it can be represented by concatenating two Mappings. The first
is a \htmlref{MatrixMap}{MatrixMap}, which implements the matrix multiplication. The second
is a \htmlref{WinMap}{WinMap}, which linearly transforms one coordinate window on to
another, but will be used here simply to implement the shift of
origin. These Mappings may be constructed and concatenated as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstCmpMap *newmap;
AstMatrixMap *matrixmap;
AstWinMap *winmap;

...

/* The MatrixMap may be constructed directly from the matrix "m". */
matrixmap = astMatrixMap( 2, 2, 0, m, "" );

/* For the WinMap, we set up the coordinates of the corners of a unit
   square (window) and then the same square shifted by the required
   amount. */
{
   double ina[] = { 0.0, 0.0 };
   double inb[] = { 1.0, 1.0 };
   double outa[] = {       z[ 0 ],       z[ 1 ] };
   double outb[] = { 1.0 + z[ 0 ], 1.0 + z[ 1 ] };

/* The WinMap will then implement this shift. */
   winmap = astWinMap( 2, ina, inb, outa, outb, "" );
}

/* Join the two Mappings together, so that they are applied one after
   the other. */
newmap = astCmpMap( matrixmap, winmap, 1, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

You might, of course, create any other form of Mapping depending on
the type of geometrical transformation involved. For an overview of
the Mappings provided by AST, see \secref{ss:mappingselection}, and
for a description of the capabilities of each class of Mapping, see
its entry in \appref{ss:classdescriptions}. For an overview of how
individual Mappings may be combined, see \secref{ss:cmpmapoverview}
(\secref{ss:cmpmaps} gives more details).

Assuming you have obtained a WCS calibration for your original image
in the form of a pointer to a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, ``wcsinfo1''
(\secref{ss:howtoreadwcs}), the Mapping created above may be used to
produce a calibration for the new image as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFrameSet *wcsinfo1, *wcsinfo2;

...

/* If necessary, make a copy of the WCS calibration, since we are
   about to alter it. */
wcsinfo2 = astCopy( wcsinfo1 );

/* Re-map the base Frame so that it refers to the new data grid
   instead of the old one. */
astRemapFrame( wcsinfo2, AST__BASE, newmap );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This will produce a pointer, ``wcsinfo2'', to a new FrameSet in which
all the coordinate systems associated with your original image are
modified so that they are correctly registered with the new image
instead.

For more information about re-mapping the Frames within a FrameSet,
see \secref{ss:remapframe}. Also see \secref{ss:wcsprocessingexample}
for a similar example to the above, applicable to the case of reducing
the size of an image by binning.

\subsection{\ldots Write a Modified WCS Calibration to a Dataset}

If you have modified the WCS calibration associated with a dataset,
such as in the example above (\secref{ss:howtomodifywcs}), then you
will need to write the modified version out along with any new data.

In the same way as when reading a WCS calibration
(\secref{ss:howtoreadwcs}), how you do this will depend on your data
system, but we will assume that you wish to generate a set of FITS
header cards that can be stored with the data. You should usually make
preparations for doing this when you first read the WCS calibration
from your input dataset by modifying the example given in
\secref{ss:howtoreadwcs} as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFitsChan *fitschan1;
AstFrameSet *wcsinfo1;
const char *encode;

...

/* Create an input FitsChan and fill it with FITS header cards. */
fitschan1 = astFitsChan( NULL, NULL, "" );
for ( icard = 0; icard < ncard; icard++ ) astPutFits( fitschan1, cards[ icard ], 0 );

/* Note which encoding has been used for the WCS information. */
encode = astGetC( fitschan1, "Encoding" );

/* Rewind the input FitsChan and read the WCS information from it. */
astClear( fitschan1, "Card" );
wcsinfo1 = astRead( fitschan1 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note how we have added an enquiry to determine how the WCS information
is encoded in the input FITS cards, storing a pointer to the resulting
string in the ``encode'' variable. This must be done {\bf{before}}
actually reading the WCS calibration.

{\em{({\bf{N.B.}}\ If you will be making extensive use of astGetC in
your program, then you should allocate a buffer and make a copy of
this string, because the pointer returned by astGetC will only remain
valid for 50 invocations of the function, and you will need to use the
\htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} value again later on.)}}

Once you have produced a modified WCS calibration for the output
dataset ({\em{e.g.}}\ \secref{ss:howtomodifywcs}), in the form of a
\htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} identified by the pointer ``wcsinfo2'', you can produce a new
\htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} containing the output FITS header cards as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFitsChan *fitschan2;
AstFrameSet *wcsinfo2;

...

/* Make a copy of the input FitsChan, AFTER the WCS information has
   been read from it. This will propagate all the input FITS header
   cards, apart from those describing the input WCS calibration. */
fitschan2 = astCopy( fitschan1 );

/* If necessary, make modifications to the cards in "fitschan2"
   (e.g. you might need to change NAXIS1, NAXIS2, etc., to account for
   a change in image size). You probably only need to do this if your
   data system does not provide these facilities itself. */
<details not shown - see below>

/* Alternatively, if your data system handles the propagation of FITS
   header cards to the output dataset for you, then simply create an
   empty FitsChan to contain the output WCS information alone.
fitschan2 = astFitsChan( NULL, NULL, "" );
*/

/* Rewind the new FitsChan (if necessary) and attempt to write the
   output WCS information to it using the same encoding method as the
   input dataset. */
astSet( fitschan2, "Card=1, Encoding=%s", encode );
if ( !astWrite( fitschan2, wcsinfo2 ) ) {

/* If this didn't work (the WCS FrameSet has become too complex), then
   use the native AST encoding instead. */
   astSet( fitschan2, "Encoding=NATIVE" );
   (void) astWrite( fitschan2, wcsinfo2 );
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

For details of how to modify the contents of the output FitsChan in
other ways, such as by adding, over-writing or deleting header cards,
see \secref{ss:addressingfitscards}, \secref{ss:addingfitscards} and
\secref{ss:findingandchangingfits}.

Once you have assembled the output FITS cards, you may retrieve them
from the FitsChan that contains them as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>
char card[ 81 ];

...

astClear( fitschan2, "Card" );
while ( astFindFits( fitschan2, "%f", card, 1 ) ) (void) printf( "%s\n", card );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, we have simply written each card to the standard output stream,
but you would obviously replace this with a function invocation to
store the cards in your output dataset.

For data systems that do not use FITS header cards, a different
approach may be needed, possibly involving use of a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}
(\secref{ss:channels}) rather than a FitsChan.  In the case of the
Starlink NDF data format, for example, all of the above may be
replaced by a single call to the function
\xref{ndfPtwcs}{sun33}{ndfPtwcs}---see \xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{}. The
whole process can probably be encapsulated in a similar way for most
data systems, whether they use FITS header cards or not.

For an overview of how to propagate WCS information through data
processing steps, see \secref{ss:propagatingwcsinformation}.  For more
information about writing WCS information to FitsChans, see
\secref{ss:writingnativefits} and \secref{ss:writingforeignfits}.  For
information about the options for encoding WCS information in FITS
header cards, see \secref{ss:nativeencoding},
\secref{ss:foreignencodings}, and the description of the Encoding
attribute in \appref{ss:attributedescriptions}.  For a complete
understanding of FitsChans and their use with FITS header cards, you
should read \secref{ss:nativefits} and \secref{ss:foreignfits}.

\subsection{\label{ss:howtoplotgrid}\ldots Display a Graphical Coordinate Grid}

\begin{latexonly}
   A common requirement when displaying image data is to plot an
   associated coordinate grid ({\em{e.g.}}\ Figure~\ref{fig:overgrid})
   over the displayed image.
   \begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{sun211_figures/overgrid_bw.eps}
   \caption{An example of a displayed image with a coordinate grid
   plotted over it.}
   \label{fig:overgrid}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   A common requirement when displaying image data is to plot an
   associated coordinate grid over the displayed image ({\em{e.g.}}\
   the following Figure):
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}[bhtp]
   \label{fig:overgrid}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{sun211_figures/overgrid.eps}
   \caption{An example of a displayed image with a coordinate grid
   plotted over it.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}
The use of AST in such circumstances is independent of the underlying
graphics system, so starting up the graphics system, setting up a
coordinate system, displaying the image, and closing down afterwards
can all be done using the graphics functions you would normally use.

However, displaying an image at a precise location can be a little
fiddly with some graphics systems, and obviously the grid drawn by AST
will not be accurately registered with the image unless this is done
correctly. In the following template, we therefore illustrate both
steps, basing the image display on the C interface to the PGPLOT
graphics package.\footnote{An interface is provided with AST that
allows it to use PGPLOT (\xref{SUN/15}{sun15}{}) for its graphics,
although interfaces to other graphics systems may also be written.}
Plotting a coordinate grid with AST then becomes a relatively minor
part of what is almost a complete graphics program.

Once again, we assume that a pointer, ``wcsinfo'', to a suitable
\htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} associated with the image has already been obtained
(\secref{ss:howtoreadwcs}).

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "cpgplot.h"
AstPlot *plot;
const float *data;
float hi, lo, scale, x1, x2, xleft, xright, xscale;
float y1, y2, ybottom, yscale, ytop;
int nx, ny;

...

/* Access the image data, which we assume has dimension sizes "nx" and
   "ny", and will be accessed via the "data" pointer.  Also derive
   limits for scaling it, which we assign to the variables "hi" and
   "lo". */
<this stage depends on your data system, so is not shown>

/* Open PGPLOT using the device given by environment variable
   PGPLOT_DEV and check for success. */
if( cpgbeg( 0, " ", 1, 1 ) == 1 ) {

/* Clear the screen and ensure equal scales on both axes. */
   cpgpage();
   cpgwnad( 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f );

/* Obtain the extent of the plotting area (not strictly necessary for
   PGPLOT, but possibly for other graphics systems). From this, derive
   the display scale in graphics units per pixel so that the image
   will fit within the display area. */
   cpgqwin( &x1, &x2, &y1, &y2 );
   xscale = ( x2 - x1 ) / nx;
   yscale = ( y2 - y1 ) / ny;
   scale = ( xscale < yscale ) ? xscale : yscale;

/* Calculate the extent of the area in graphics units that the image
   will occupy, so as to centre it within the display area. */
   xleft   = 0.5f * ( x1 + x2 - nx * scale );
   xright  = 0.5f * ( x1 + x2 + nx * scale );
   ybottom = 0.5f * ( y1 + y2 - ny * scale );
   ytop    = 0.5f * ( y1 + y2 + ny * scale );

/* Set up a PGPLOT coordinate transformation matrix and display the
   image data as a grey scale map (these details are specific to
   PGPLOT). */
   {
      float tr[] = { xleft - 0.5f * scale, scale, 0.0f,
                     ybottom - 0.5f * scale, 0.0f, scale };
      cpggray( data, nx, ny, 1, nx, 1, ny, hi, lo, tr );
   }

/* BEGINNING OF AST BIT */
/* ==================== */
/* Store the locations of the bottom left and top right corners of the
   region used to display the image, in graphics coordinates. */
   {
      float gbox[] = { xleft, ybottom, xright, ytop };

/* Similarly, store the locations of the image's bottom left and top
   right corners, in pixel coordinates -- with the first pixel centred
   at (1,1). */
      double pbox[] = { 0.5, 0.5, nx + 0.5, ny + 0.5 };

/* Create a Plot, based on the FrameSet associated with the
   image. This attaches the Plot to the graphics surface so that it
   matches the displayed image. Specify that a complete set of grid
   lines should be drawn (rather than just coordinate axes). */
      plot = astPlot( wcsinfo, gbox, pbox, "Grid=1" );
   }

/* Optionally, we can now set other Plot attributes to control the
   appearance of the grid. The values assigned here use the
   colour/font indices defined by the underlying graphics system. */
   astSet( plot, "Colour(grid)=2, Font(textlab)=3" );

/* Use the Plot to draw the coordinate grid. */
   astGrid( plot );

   <maybe some more AST graphics here>

/* Annul the Plot when finished (or use the astBegin/astEnd technique
   shown earlier). */
   plot = astAnnul( plot );

/* END OF AST BIT */
/* ============== */

/* Close down the graphics system. */
   cpgend();
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note that once you have set up a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} which is aligned with a
displayed image, you may also use it to generate further graphical
output of your own, specified in the image's world coordinate system
(such as markers to represent astronomical objects, annotation,
{\em{etc.}}). There is also a range of Plot attributes which gives
control over most aspects of the output's appearance.  For details of
the facilities available, see \secref{ss:plots} and the description of
the Plot class in \appref{ss:classdescriptions}.

For details of how to build a graphics program which uses PGPLOT, see
\secref{ss:howtobuild} and the description of the \htmlref{ast\_link}{ast_link} command in
\appref{ss:commanddescriptions}.

\subsection{\label{ss:howtoswitchgrid}\ldots Switch to Plot a Different Celestial Coordinate Grid}

Once you have set up a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} to draw a coordinate grid
(\secref{ss:howtoplotgrid}), it is a simple matter to change things so
that the grid represents a different celestial coordinate system. For
example, after creating the Plot with \htmlref{astPlot}{astPlot}, you could use:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( plot, "System=Galactic" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}
or:
\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( plot, "System=FK5, Equinox=J2010" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

and any axes and/or grid drawn subsequently would represent the new
celestial coordinate system you specified.  Note, however, that this
will only work if the original grid represented celestial coordinates
of some kind (see \secref{ss:howtotestforcelestial} for how to
determine if this is the case\footnote{Note that the methods applied
to a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} may be used equally well with a Plot.}). If it did not,
you will get an error message.

For more information about the celestial coordinate systems available,
see the descriptions of the \htmlref{System}{System}, \htmlref{Equinox}{Equinox} and \htmlref{Epoch}{Epoch} attributes in
\appref{ss:attributedescriptions}.

\subsection{\ldots Give a User Control Over the Appearance of a Plot}

The idea of using a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot}'s attributes to control the appearance of the
graphical output it produces (\secref{ss:howtoplotgrid} and
\secref{ss:howtoswitchgrid}) can easily be extended to allow the user
of a program complete control over such matters.

For instance, if the file ``plot.config'' contains a series of
plotting options in the form of Plot attribute assignments (see below
for an example), then we could create a Plot and implement these
assignments before producing the graphical output as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAXCHARS 120
FILE *stream;
char line[ MAXCHARS + 2 ];
int base;

...

/* Create a Plot and define the default appearance of the graphical
   output it will produce. */
plot = astPlot( wcsinfo, gbox, pbox,
                "Grid=1, Colour(grid)=2, Font(textlab)=3" );

/* Obtain the value of any Plot attributes we want to preserve. */
base = astGetI( plot, "Base" );

/* Open the plot configuration file, if it exists. Read each line of
   text and use it to set new Plot attribute values. Close the file
   when done. */
if ( stream = fopen( "plot.config", "r" ) ) {
   while ( fgets( line, MAXCHARS + 2, stream ) ) astSet( plot, "%s", line );
   close( stream );
}

/* Restore any attribute values we are preserving. */
astSetI( plot, "Base", base );

/* Produce the graphical output (e.g.). */
astGrid( plot );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Notice that we take care that the Plot's \htmlref{Base}{Base} attribute is preserved
so that the user cannot change it. This is because graphical output
will not be produced successfully if the base \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} does not describe
the plotting surface to which we attached the Plot when we created it.

The arrangement shown above allows the contents of the ``plot.config''
file to control most aspects of the graphical output produced
(including the coordinate system used; the colour, line style,
thickness and font used for each component; the positioning of axes
and tick marks; the precision, format and positioning of labels;
{\em{etc.}}) {\em{via}} assignments of the form:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
System=Galactic, Equinox = 2001
Border = 1, Colour( border ) = 1
Colour( grid ) = 2
DrawAxes = 1
Colour( axes ) = 3
Digits = 8
Labelling = Interior
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

For a more sophisticated interface, you could obviously perform
pre-processing on this input---for example, to translate words like
``red'', ``green'' and ``blue'' into colour indices, to permit
comments and blank lines, {\em{etc.}}

For a full list of the attributes that may be used to control the
appearance of graphical output, see the description of the Plot class
in \appref{ss:classdescriptions}. For a complete description of each
individual attribute ({\em{e.g.}}\ those above), see the attribute's
entry in \appref{ss:attributedescriptions}.

\section{\label{ss:primer}An AST Object Primer}

The AST library deals throughout with entities called Objects and a
basic understanding of how to handle these is needed before you can
use the library effectively.  If you are already familiar with an
object-oriented language, such as C$++$, few of the concepts should
seem new to you.  Be aware, however, that AST is designed to be used
{\em{via}} fairly conventional C and Fortran interfaces, so some
things have to be done a little differently.

If you are not already familiar with object-oriented programming, then
don't worry---we will not emphasise this aspect more than is necessary
and will not assume any background knowledge.  Instead, this section
concentrates on presenting all the fundamental information you will
need, explaining how AST Objects behave and how to manipulate them
from conventional C programs.

If you like to read documents from cover to cover, then you can
consider this section as an introduction to the programming techniques
used in the rest of the document. Otherwise, you may prefer to skim
through it on a first reading and return to it later as reference
material.

\subsection{AST Objects}

An AST \htmlref{Object}{Object} is an entity which is used to store information and
Objects come in various kinds, called {\em{classes,}} according to the
sort of information they hold. Throughout this section, we will make
use of a simple Object belonging to the ``\htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap}'' class to
illustrate many of the basic concepts.

A ZoomMap is an Object that contains a recipe for converting
coordinates between two hypothetical coordinate systems.  It does this
by multiplying all the coordinate values by a constant called the
{\em{\htmlref{Zoom}{Zoom} factor.}}  A ZoomMap is a very simple Object which exists
mainly for use in examples. It allows us to illustrate the ways in
which Objects are manipulated and to introduce the concept of a
\htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}---a recipe for converting coordinates---which is fundamental
to the way the AST library works.

\subsection{\label{ss:objectcreation}Object Creation and Pointers}

Let us first consider how to create a \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap}. This is done very
simply as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
AstZoomMap *zoommap;

...

zoommap = astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "" )
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The first step is to include the header file ``ast.h'' which declares
the interface to the AST library.  We then declare a pointer of type
AstZoomMap$*$ to receive the result and invoke the function \htmlref{astZoomMap}{astZoomMap}
to create the ZoomMap. The pattern is the same for all other classes
of AST \htmlref{Object}{Object}---you simply prefix ``ast'' to the class name to obtain
the function that creates the Object and prefix ``Ast'' to obtain the
type of the returned pointer.

These functions are called {\em{constructor functions,}} or simply
{\em{constructors}} (you can find an individual description of all AST
functions in \appref{ss:functiondescriptions}) and the arguments
passed to the constructor are used to initialise the new Object. In
this case, we specify 2 as the number of coordinates ({\em{i.e.}}\ we
are going to work in a 2-dimensional
space) and 5.0 as the \htmlref{Zoom}{Zoom} factor to be applied. Note that this is a C
double value. We will return to the final argument, an empty string,
shortly (\secref{ss:attributeinitialisation}).

The value returned by the constructor is termed an {\em{Object pointer}}
or, in this case, a {\em{ZoomMap pointer}} and is used to refer to the
Object.  You perform all subsequent operations on the Object by
passing this pointer to other AST functions.

\subsection{\label{ss:objecthierarchy}The Object Hierarchy}

Now that we have created our first \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap}, let us examine how it
relates to other kinds of \htmlref{Object}{Object} before investigating what we can do
with it.

We have so far indicated that a ZoomMap is a kind of Object and have
also mentioned that it is a kind of \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} as well. These statements
can be represented very simply using the following hierarchy:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
Object
   Mapping
      ZoomMap
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

which is a way of stating that a ZoomMap is a special class of
Mapping, while a Mapping, in turn, is a special class of Object.  This
is exactly like saying that an Oak is a special form of Tree, while a
Tree, in turn, is a special form of Plant. This may seem almost
trivial, but before you turn to read something less dull, be assured
that it is a very important idea to keep in mind in what follows.

If we look at some of the other Objects used by the AST library, we
can see how these are all related in a similar way (don't worry about
what they do at this stage):
\label{ss:mappinghierarchy}

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
Object
   Mapping
      Frame
         FrameSet
            Plot
      UnitMap
      ZoomMap
   Channel
      FitsChan
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Notice that there are several different types of Mapping available
({\em{i.e.}}\ there are classes of Object indented beneath the
``Mapping'' heading) and, in addition, other types of Object which are
not Mappings---Channels for instance (which are at the same
hierarchical level as Mappings).

The most specialised Object we have shown here is the \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} (which we
will not discuss in detail until \secref{ss:plots}). As you can see, a
Plot is a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}\ldots\ and a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}\ldots\ and a Mapping\ldots\ and,
like everything else, ultimately an Object.

What this means is that you can use a Plot not only for its own
specialised behaviour, but also whenever any of these other
less-specialised classes of Object is called for. The general rule is
that an Object of a particular class may substitute for any of the
classes appearing above it in this hierarchy. The Object is then said
to {\em{inherit}} the behaviour of these higher classes. We can
therefore use our ZoomMap whenever a ZoomMap, a Mapping or an Object
is called for.

Sometimes, this can lead to some spectacular short-cuts by avoiding
the need to break large Objects down in order to access their
components. With some practice and a little lateral thinking you
should soon be able to spot opportunities for this.

You can find the full {\em{class hierarchy}}, as this is called, for
the AST library in \appref{ss:classhierarchy} and you may need to
refer to it occasionally until you are familiar with the classes you
need to use.

\subsection{\label{ss:displayingobjects}Displaying Objects}

Let us now return to the \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} that we created earlier
(\secref{ss:objectcreation}) and examine what it's made of.
There is a function for doing this, called \htmlref{astShow}{astShow}, which is provided
mainly for looking at Objects while you are debugging programs.

If you consult the description of astShow in
\appref{ss:functiondescriptions}, you will find that it takes a
pointer to an \htmlref{Object}{Object} (of type AstObject$*$) as its argument. Although
we have only a ZoomMap pointer available, this is not a problem. If
you refer to the brief class hierarchy described above
(\secref{ss:mappinghierarchy}), you will see that a ZoomMap is an
Object, albeit a specialised one, so it inherits the properties of all
Objects and can be substituted wherever an Object is required.  We can
therefore pass our ZoomMap pointer directly to astShow, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astShow( zoommap );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The output from this will appear on the standard output stream and
should look like the following:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
Begin ZoomMap
   Nin = 2
IsA Mapping
   Zoom = 5
End ZoomMap
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, the ``Begin'' and ``End'' lines mark the beginning and end of
the ZoomMap, while the values 2 and 5 are simply the values we
supplied to initialise it (\secref{ss:objectcreation}). These have
been given simple names to make them easy to refer to.

The line in the middle which says ``IsA~\htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}'' is a dividing line
between the two values. It indicates that the ``\htmlref{Nin}{Nin}'' value is a
property shared by all Mappings, so the ZoomMap has inherited this
from its {\em{parent class}} (Mapping). The ``\htmlref{Zoom}{Zoom}'' value, however,
is specific to a ZoomMap and isn't shared by other kinds of Mappings.

\subsection{\label{ss:gettingattributes}Getting Attribute Values}

We saw above (\secref{ss:displayingobjects}) how to display the
internal values of an \htmlref{Object}{Object}, but what about accessing these values
from a program?  Not all internal Object values are accessible in this
way, but many are. Those that are, are called {\em{attributes}}. A
description of all the attributes used by the AST library can be found
in \appref{ss:attributedescriptions}.

Attributes come in several data types (character string, integer,
boolean and floating point) and there is a standard way of obtaining
their values. As an example, consider obtaining the value of the \htmlref{Nin}{Nin}
attribute for the \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} created earlier. This could be done as
follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int nin;

...

nin = astGetI( zoommap, "Nin" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, the function astGetI is used to extract the attribute value by
giving it the ZoomMap pointer and the attribute name (attribute names
are not case sensitive, but we have used consistent capitalisation in
this document in order to identify them). Remember to use the
``ast.h'' header file to include the function prototype.

If we had wanted the value of the \htmlref{Zoom}{Zoom} attribute, we would probably
have used astGetD instead, this being a double version of the same
function, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double zoom;

...

zoom = astGetD( zoommap, "Zoom" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

However, we could equally well have read the Nin value as double, or
the Zoom value as an integer, or whatever we wanted.

The data type you want returned is specified simply by replacing the
final character of the astGetX function name with C~(character
string), D~(double), F~(float), I~(int) or L~(long). If possible, the
value is converted to the type you want. If not, an error message will
result. Note that all floating point values are stored internally as
double, and all integer values as int. Boolean values are also stored
as integers, but only take the values 1 and 0 (for true/false).

\subsection{\label{ss:settingattributes}Setting Attribute Values}

Some attribute values are read-only and cannot be altered after an
\htmlref{Object}{Object} has been created. The \htmlref{Nin}{Nin} attribute of a \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} (describing
the number of coordinates) is like this. It is defined when the
ZoomMap is created, but cannot then be altered.

Other attributes, however, can be modified whenever you want. A
ZoomMap's \htmlref{Zoom}{Zoom} attribute is like this. If we wanted to change it, this
could be done simply as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSetD( zoommap, "Zoom", 99.6 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

which sets the value to 99.6. As when getting an attribute value
(\secref{ss:gettingattributes}), you have a choice of which data type
you will use to supply the new value. For instance, you could use an
integer value, as in:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSetI( zoommap, "Zoom", 99 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

and the necessary data conversion would occur.  You specify the data
type you want to supply simply by replacing the final character of the
astSetX function name with C~(character string), D~(double),
F~(float), I~(int) or L~(long). Setting a boolean attribute to any
non-zero integer causes it to take the value 1.

An alternative way of setting attribute values for Objects is to use
the \htmlref{astSet}{astSet} function ({\em{i.e.}}\ with no final character specifying a
data type). In this case, you supply the attribute values in a
character string. The big advantage of this method is that you can
assign values to several attributes at once, separating them with
commas. This also reads more naturally in programs. For example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( zoommap, "Zoom=99.6, Report=1" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

would set values for both the Zoom attribute and the \htmlref{Report}{Report} attribute
(about which more shortly---\secref{ss:transforming}). You don't really
have to worry about data types with this method, as any character
representation will do.

Another attractive feature of astSet is that you can build the
character string which contains the attribute settings in the same way
as when using the C run time library ``printf'' function. This is most
useful when the values you want to set are held in other
variables. For example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double zoom = 99.6;
int report = 1;

...

astSet( zoommap, "Zoom=%g, Report=%d", zoom, report );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

would replace the ``\%'' conversion specifications by the values
supplied as additional arguments. Any number of additional arguments
may be supplied and the formatting rules are exactly the same as for
the C ``printf'' family of functions. This is a very flexible
technique, but does contain one pitfall:

\begin{quote}
{\bf{Pitfall.}} The default precision used by ``printf'' (and astSet)
for floating point values is only 6 decimal digits, corresponding
approximately to float on most machines, whereas the AST library
stores such values internally as doubles. You should be careful to
specify a larger precision (such as DBL\_DIG, as defined in
$<$float.h$>$) when necessary. For example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <float.h>

...

astSet( zoommap, "Zoom=%.*g", DBL_DIG, double_value );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Substituted strings may contain commas and this is a useful way of
assigning such strings as attribute values without the comma being
interpreted as an assignment separator, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( object, "Attribute=%s", "A string, containing a comma" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This is equivalent to using astSetC and one of these two methods
should always be used when assigning string attribute values which
might potentially contain a comma ({\em{e.g.}}\ strings obtained from
an external source). However, you should not attempt to use astSet to
substitute strings that contain newline characters, since these are
used internally as separators between adjacent attribute assignments.
\label{ss:attributeinitialisation}

Finally, a very convenient way of setting attribute values is to do so
at the same time as you create an Object. Every Object constructor
function has a final character string argument which allows you to do
this. Although you can simply supply an empty string, it is an ideal
opportunity to initialise the Object to have just the attributes you
want. For example, we might have created our original ZoomMap with:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
zoommap = astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "Report=1" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

and it would then start life with its Report attribute set to 1.
The ``printf''-style substitution described above may also be used
here.

\subsection{\label{ss:defaultingattributes}Testing, Clearing and Defaulting Attributes}

You can use the astGetX family of functions
(\secref{ss:gettingattributes}) to get a value for any \htmlref{Object}{Object} attribute
at any time, regardless of whether a value has previously been set for
it. If no value has been set, the AST library will generate a suitable
default value.

Often, the default value of an attribute will not simply be trivial
(zero or blank) but may involve considerable processing to
calculate. Wherever possible, defaults are designed to be real-life,
sensible values that convey information about the state of the
Object. In particular, they may often be based on the values of other
attributes, so their values may change in response to changes in these
other attributes. The \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} class that we have studied so far is a
little too simple to show this behaviour, but we will meet it later
on.

An attribute that returns a default value in this way is said to be
{\em{un-set.}} Conversely, once an explicit value has been assigned to
an attribute, it becomes {\em{set}} and will always return precisely
that value, never a default.

The distinction between set and un-set attributes is important and
affects the behaviour of several key routines in the AST library. You
can test if an attribute is set using the function \htmlref{astTest}{astTest}, which
returns a boolean (integer) result, as in:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
if ( astTest( zoommap, "Report" ) ) {
   <the Report attribute is set>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}


Once an attribute is set, you can return it to its un-set state using
\htmlref{astClear}{astClear}. The effect is as if it had never been set in the first
place. For example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astClear( zoommap, "Report" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

would ensure that the default value of the \htmlref{Report}{Report} attribute is used
subsequently.

%\subsection{TBW--Handling Character Attributes}

\subsection{\label{ss:transforming}Transforming Coordinates}

We now have the necessary apparatus to start using our \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} to show
what it is really for. Here, we will also encounter a routine that is
a little more fussy about the type of pointer it will accept.

The purpose of a ZoomMap is to multiply coordinates by a constant zoom
factor. To witness this in action, we will first set the \htmlref{Report}{Report}
attribute for our ZoomMap to a non-zero value:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( zoommap, "Report=1" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This boolean (integer) attribute, which is present in all Mappings
(and a ZoomMap is a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}), causes the automatic display of all
coordinate values that the Mapping converts. It is not a good idea to
leave this feature turned on in a finished program, but it can save a
lot of work during debugging.

Our next step is to set up some coordinates for the ZoomMap to work
on, using two arrays ``xin'' and ``yin'', and two arrays to receive
the transformed coordinates, ``xout'' and ``yout''.  Note that these
are arrays of double, as are all coordinate data processed by the AST
library:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double xin[ 10 ] = { 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 };
double yin[ 10 ] = { 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 14.0, 16.0, 18.0 };
double xout[ 10 ];
double yout[ 10 ];
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

We will now use the function \htmlref{astTran2}{astTran2} to transform the input
coordinates. This is the most commonly-used (2-dimensional) coordinate
transformation function. If you look at its description in
\appref{ss:functiondescriptions}, you will see that it requires a
pointer to a Mapping, so we cannot supply just any old \htmlref{Object}{Object} pointer,
as we could with the functions discussed previously. If we passed it a
pointer to an inappropriate Object, an error message would result.

Fortunately, a ZoomMap is a Mapping (\appref{ss:classhierarchy}), so we
can use it with astTran2 to transform our coordinates, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astTran2( zoommap, 10, xin, yin, 1, xout, yout );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, 10 is the number of points we want to transform and the fifth
argument value of 1 indicates that we want to transform in the
{\em{forward}} direction (from input to output).

Because our ZoomMap's Report attribute is set to 1, this will cause
the effects of the ZoomMap on the coordinates to be displayed on the
standard output stream:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
(0, 0) --> (0, 0)
(1, 2) --> (5, 10)
(2, 4) --> (10, 20)
(3, 6) --> (15, 30)
(4, 8) --> (20, 40)
(5, 10) --> (25, 50)
(6, 12) --> (30, 60)
(7, 14) --> (35, 70)
(8, 16) --> (40, 80)
(9, 18) --> (45, 90)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This shows the coordinate values of each point both before and after
the ZoomMap is applied. You can see that each coordinate value has
been multiplied by the factor 5 determined by the \htmlref{Zoom}{Zoom} attribute
value. The transformed coordinates are now stored in the ``xout'' and
``yout'' arrays.

If we wanted to transform in the opposite direction, we need simply
change the fifth argument of astTran2 from 1 to 0. We can also feed
the output coordinates from the above back into the function:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astTran2( zoommap, 10, xout, yout, 0, xin, yin );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The output would then look like:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
(0, 0) --> (0, 0)
(5, 10) --> (1, 2)
(10, 20) --> (2, 4)
(15, 30) --> (3, 6)
(20, 40) --> (4, 8)
(25, 50) --> (5, 10)
(30, 60) --> (6, 12)
(35, 70) --> (7, 14)
(40, 80) --> (8, 16)
(45, 90) --> (9, 18)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This is termed the {\em{inverse}} transformation (we have converted
from output to input) and you can see that the original coordinates
have been recovered by dividing by the Zoom factor.

\subsection{\label{ss:annullingpointers}Managing Object Pointers}

So far, we have looked at creating Objects and using them in various
simple ways but have not yet considered how to get rid of them again.

Every \htmlref{Object}{Object} consumes various computer resources (principally memory)
and should be disposed of when it is no longer required, so as to free
up these resources. One way of doing this (not necessarily the
best---\secref{ss:contexts}) is to {\em{annul}} each Object pointer once
you have finished with it, using \htmlref{astAnnul}{astAnnul}. For example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
zoommap = astAnnul( zoommap );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This indicates that you have finished with the pointer. Since astAnnul
always returns the null value AST\_\_NULL (as defined in ``ast.h''),
the recommended way of using it, as here, is to assign the returned
value to the pointer being annulled. This ensures that any attempt to
use the pointer again will generate an error message.

In general, this process may not delete the Object, because there may
still be other pointers associated with it. However, each Object
maintains a count of the number of pointers associated with it and
will be deleted if you annul the final pointer. Using astAnnul
consistently will therefore ensure that all Objects are disposed of at
the correct time. You can determine how many pointers are associated
with an Object by examining its (read-only) \htmlref{RefCount}{RefCount} attribute.

\subsection{\label{ss:contexts}AST Pointer Contexts---Begin and End}

The use of \htmlref{astAnnul}{astAnnul} (\secref{ss:annullingpointers}) is not completely
foolproof, however. Consider the following:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astShow( astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "" ) );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This creates a \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} and displays it on standard output
(\secref{ss:displayingobjects}). Using function invocations as
arguments to other functions in this way is very convenient because it
avoids the need for intermediate pointer variables. However, the
pointer generated by \htmlref{astZoomMap}{astZoomMap} is still active, and since we have not
stored its value, we cannot use astAnnul to annul it. The ZoomMap will
therefore stay around until the end of the program.

A simple way to avoid this problem is to enclose all use of AST
functions between invocations of \htmlref{astBegin}{astBegin} and \htmlref{astEnd}{astEnd}, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astBegin;
astShow( astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "" ) );
astEnd;
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

When the expansion of astEnd (which is a macro) executes, every \htmlref{Object}{Object}
pointer created since the previous use of astBegin (also a macro) is
automatically annulled and any Objects left without pointers are
deleted. This provides a simple solution to managing Objects and their
pointers, and allows you to create Objects very freely without needing
to keep detailed track of each one.  Because this is so convenient, we
implicitly assume that astBegin and astEnd are used in most of the
examples given in this document.  Pointer management is not generally
shown explicitly unless it is particularly relevant to the point being
illustrated.

If necessary, astBegin and astEnd may be nested, like blocks delimited
by ``\{\ldots\}'' in C, to define a series of AST pointer
contexts. Each use of astEnd will then annul only those Object
pointers created since the matching use of astBegin.

\subsection{Exporting and Exempting AST Pointers}
The \htmlref{astExport}{astExport} function allows you to export particular pointers from
one AST context (\secref{ss:contexts}) to the next outer one, as
follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astExport( zoommap );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This would identify the pointer stored in ``zoommap'' as being required
after the end of the current AST context. It causes any pointers
nominated in this way to survive the next use of \htmlref{astEnd}{astEnd} (but only one
such use) unscathed, so that they are available to the next outer
context.  This facility is not needed often, but is invaluable when
the purpose of your \htmlref{astBegin}{astBegin}\ldots astEnd block is basically to
generate an \htmlref{Object}{Object} pointer. Without this, there is no way of getting
that pointer out.

Sometimes, you may also want to exempt a pointer from all the effects
of AST contexts. You should not need to do this often, but it will
prove essential if you ever need to write a library of functions that
stores AST pointers as part of its own internal data. Without some
form of exemption, the caller of your routines could cause the
pointers you have stored to be annulled---thus corrupting your
internal data---simply by using astEnd. To avoid this, you should use
\htmlref{astExempt}{astExempt} on each pointer that you store, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astExempt( zoommap );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This will prevent the pointer being affected by any subsequent use of
astEnd. Of course, it then becomes your responsibility to annul this
pointer (using \htmlref{astAnnul}{astAnnul}) when it is no longer required.

\subsection{\label{ss:copyingobjects}Copying Objects}

The AST library makes extensive use of pointers, not only for
accessing Objects directly, but also as a means of storing Objects
inside other Objects (a number of classes of \htmlref{Object}{Object} are designed to
hold collections of other Objects). Rather than copy an Object in its
entirety, a pointer to the interior Object is simply stored in the
enclosing Object.

This means that Objects may frequently not be completely independent
of each other because, for instance, they both contain pointers to the
same sub-Object. In this situation, changing one Object (say assigning
an attribute value) may affect the other one {\em{via}} the common
Object.

It is difficult to describe all cases where this may happen, so you
should always be alert to the possibility. Fortunately, there is a
simple solution. If you require two Objects to be independent, then
simply use \htmlref{astCopy}{astCopy} to make a copy of one, {\em{e.g:}}

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstZoomMap *zoommap1, *zoommap2;

...

zoommap2 = astCopy( zoommap1 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This process will create a true copy of any Object and return a
pointer to the copy. This copy will not contain any pointers to any
component of the original Object (everything is duplicated), so you
can then modify it safely, without fear of affecting either the
original or any other Object.

%\subsection{TBW - Inheritance}

\subsection{C Pointer Types}

At this point it is necessary to confess to a small amount of
deception. So far, we have been passing \htmlref{Object}{Object} pointers to AST
functions in order to perform operations on those Objects. In fact,
however, what we were using were not true C functions at all, but
merely macros which invoke a related set of hidden functions with
essentially the same arguments. In practical terms, this makes very
little difference to how you use the functions, as we will continue to
call them.\footnote{About the only difference is that you cannot store
a pointer to an AST ``function'' in a variable and use the variable's
value to invoke that function again later.}

The reason for this deception has to do with the rules for data typing
in C. Recall that most AST functions can be used to process Objects
from a range of different classes (\secref{ss:objecthierarchy}). In C,
this means passing different pointer types to the same function and
most C compilers will not permit this (at least, not without
grumbling) because it usually indicates a programming error. In AST,
however, it is perfectly safe if done properly. Some way is therefore
needed of circumventing the normal compiler checking.

The normal way of doing this in C is with a cast. This approach
quickly becomes cumbersome, however, so we have adopted the strategy
of wrapping each function in a macro which applies the appropriate
cast for you. This means that you can pass pointers of any type to any
AST function. For example, in passing a \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} pointer to \htmlref{astShow}{astShow}:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstZoomMap *zoommap;

...

zoommap = astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "" );
astShow( zoommap );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

we are exploiting this mechanism to avoid a compiler warning, because
the notional type of astShow's parameter is AstObject$*$ (not
AstZoomMap$*$).

We must still guard against programming errors, however, so every
pointer's type is checked by the enclosing macro immediately before
any AST function executes. This allows pointer mis-matches (in the
more liberal AST sense---{\em{i.e.}}\ taking account of the class
hierarchy, rather than the stricter C sense) to be detected at
run-time and a suitable error message will be reported. This message
should also identify the line where the error occurs.

A similar strategy is used when pointers are returned by AST functions
({\em{i.e.}}\ as the function result). In this case the pointer is
cast to void$*$, although we retain the notional pointer type in the
function's documentation
({\em{e.g.}}\ \appref{ss:functiondescriptions}). This allows you to
assign function results to pointer variables without using an explicit
cast. For example, the \htmlref{astRead}{astRead} function returns an Object pointer, but
might be used to read (say) a ZoomMap as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstChannel *channel;
AstZoomMap *zoommap;

...

zoommap = astRead( channel );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Strictly, there is a C pointer mis-match here, but it is ignored
because the operation makes perfect sense to AST.

{\bf{There is an important exception to this, however, in that
constructor functions always return strongly-typed pointers.}}  What
we mean by this is that the returned pointer is never implicitly cast
to void$*$. You must therefore match pointer types when you initially
create an Object using its constructor, such as in the following:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstZoomMap *zoommap;

...

zoommap = astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

If the variable receiving the pointer is of a different type, an
appropriate cast should be used, as in:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstMapping *mapping;

...

mapping = (AstMapping *) astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This is an encouragement for you to declare your pointer types
consistently, since this is of great benefit to anyone trying to
understand your software.

Finally, we should also make one more small confession---AST pointers
are not really pointers at all.  Although they behave like pointers,
the actual ``values'' stored are not the addresses of C data
structures. This means that you cannot de-reference an AST pointer to
examine the data within (although you can use astShow
instead---\secref{ss:displayingobjects}). This is necessary so that AST
pointers can be made unique even although several of them might
reference the same Object.

\subsection{\label{ss:errordetection}Error Detection}

If an error occurs in an AST function (for example, if you supply an
invalid argument, such as a pointer to the wrong class of \htmlref{Object}{Object}), an
error message will be written to the standard error stream and the
function will immediately return.

To indicate than an error has occurred, an AST {\em{error status}}
value is used. This integer value is stored internally by AST and is
initially clear ({\em{i.e.}}\ set to zero\footnote{We will assume
throughout that the ``OK'' value is zero, as it currently is. However,
a different value could, in principle, be used if the environment in
which AST is running requires it. This is why a simple interface is
provided to isolate you from the actual value of the error status.}
to indicate no error). If an error occurs, it becomes set to a
different {\em{error value}}, which allows you to detect the error, as
follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
zoommap = astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "Title=My ZoomMap" );
if ( !astOK ) {
   <an error has occurred>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The macro \htmlref{astOK}{astOK} is used to test whether the AST error status is still
OK. In this example it would not be, because we have attempted to set
a value for the \htmlref{Title}{Title} attribute of a \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} and a ZoomMap does not
have such an attribute.  The actual value of the AST error status can
be obtained using the \htmlref{astStatus}{astStatus} macro, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int status;

...


status = astStatus;
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

A consequence of the AST error status being set is that almost all AST
functions will subsequently cease to function and will instead simply
return without action.  This means that you do not need to use astOK
to check for errors very frequently. Instead, you can usually simply
invoke a succession of AST functions. If an error occurs in any of
them, the following ones will do nothing and you can check for the
error at the end, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astFunctionA( ... );
astFunctionB( ... );
astFunctionC( ... );
if ( !astOK ) {
   <an error has occurred>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

There are, however, a few functions which do not adhere to this
general rule and which will attempt to execute if the AST error status
is set. These functions, such as \htmlref{astAnnul}{astAnnul}, are concerned with cleaning
up and recovering resources. For example, in the following:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
zoommap = astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "" );

astFunctionX( ... );
astFunctionY( ... );
astFunctionZ( ... );

zoommap = astAnnul( zoommap );
if ( !astOK ) {
   <an error has occurred>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

astAnnul will execute normally in order to recover the resources
associated with the ZoomMap that was created earlier, regardless of
whether an error has occurred in any of the intermediate functions.
Functions which behave in this way are noted in the relevant
descriptions in \appref{ss:functiondescriptions}.

If a serious error occurs, you will probably want to abort your
program, but sometimes you may want to recover and carry on. Because
very few AST functions will execute once the AST error status has been
set, you must first clear this status by using the \htmlref{astClearStatus}{astClearStatus}
macro, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astClearStatus;
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This will restore the AST error status to its OK value, so that AST
functions execute normally again.

Occasionally, you may also need to set the AST error status to an
explicit error value (see \secref{ss:channelsink} for an
example). This is done using \htmlref{astSetStatus}{astSetStatus} and can be used to
communicate to AST that an error has occurred in some other item of
software, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int new_status;

...

astSetStatus( new_status );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The effect is that most AST routines will subsequently return without
action, just as if an error had occurred within the AST library
itself.

\subsection{Sharing the Error Status}

In some software, it is usual to maintain a single integer error
status variable which is accessed by each function as it executes. If
an error occurs, this status variable is set and other functions can
detect this and take appropriate action.

If you use AST in such a situation, it can be awkward to have a
separate internal error status used by AST functions alone. To remedy
this, AST is capable of sharing the error status variable used by any
other software, so long as they use the same conventions
({\em{i.e.}}\ a C int with the same ``OK'' value). To enable this
facility, you should pass the address of your status variable to
\htmlref{astWatch}{astWatch}, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int my_status;
int *old_address;

...

old_address = astWatch( &my_status );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Henceforth, instead of using its own internal error status variable,
AST will use the one you supply, so that it can detect errors flagged
by other parts of your software. The address of the original error
status variable is returned by astWatch, so you can restore the
original behaviour later if necessary.

Note that this facility is not available {\em{via}} the Fortran
interface to the AST library.

\section{\label{ss:mappings}Inter-Relating Coordinate Systems (Mappings)}

In \secref{ss:primer} we used the \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} as an example of a
\htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}. We saw how it could be used to transform coordinates from its
input to its output and back again (\secref{ss:transforming}). We also
saw how its behaviour could be controlled by setting various
attributes, such as the \htmlref{Zoom}{Zoom} factor and the \htmlref{Report}{Report} attribute that made
it display coordinate values as it transformed them.

In this section, we will look at Mappings a bit more thoroughly and
explore the behaviour which is common to all the Mappings provided by
AST.  This is good background for what follows, because many of the
Objects we discuss later will also turn out to be Mappings in various
disguises.

\subsection{\label{ss:mappingclass}The Mapping Class}

Before we start, it is worth taking a quick look at the \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} class
as a whole and some of the sub-classes it contains:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
   Mapping
      CmpMap
      DssMap
      IntraMap
      LutMap
      MathMap
      MatrixMap
      PermMap
      SlaMap
      UnitMap
      WcsMap
      ZoomMap

      Frame
         <various types of Frame>
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

The \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} sub-class has been separated out here because it is covered
in detail in \secref{ss:frames}. We start by looking at the parent
class, Mapping.

AST does not provide a function to create a basic Mapping
({\em{i.e.}}\ the astMapping constructor does not exist). This is
because the Mapping class itself is ``virtual'' and basic Mappings are
of no use in themselves. The Mapping class serves simply to contain
the various specialised Mappings that exist.
However, it provides more than just a convenient heading for them
because it bestows all classes of Mapping with common properties
({\em{e.g.}}\ attributes) and behaviour.  By examining the Mapping
class, we are therefore examining the things that all other Mappings
have in common.

\subsection{The Mapping Model}

The concept of a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} was illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:mapping}.
It is a black box which you can supply with a set of coordinate values
in return for a set of transformed coordinates. The two sets are
termed {\em{input}} and {\em{output}} coordinates. You can also go
back the other way and transform output coordinates back into input
coordinates, as we saw in \secref{ss:transforming}.

\subsection{Input and Output Coordinate Numbers}

In general, the number of coordinates you feed into a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} to
represent a single point need not be the same as the number that comes
out. Often these numbers will be the same, and often they will both
equal 2 (because 2-dimensional coordinate systems are common), but
this needn't necessarily be the case.

The number of coordinates required to specify an input point is
represented by the integer attribute \htmlref{Nin}{Nin} and the number required to
specify an output point is represented by \htmlref{Nout}{Nout}. These are read-only
attributes common to all Mappings. Generally, their values are fixed
when a Mapping is created.

In \secref{ss:objectcreation}, we saw how the Nin attribute for a
\htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} was initialised by the call to the constructor function
\htmlref{astZoomMap}{astZoomMap} which created it. In this case, the Nout attribute was not
needed and it implicitly took the same value as Nout, but we could
have enquired about its value had we wanted, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
AstZoomMap *zoommap;
int nout;

...

nout = astGetI( zoommap, "Nout" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

\subsection{Forward and Inverse Transformations}

We stated earlier that a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} may be used to transform coordinates
either from input to output, or {\em{vice versa.}} These are termed
its {\em{forward}} and {\em{inverse}} transformations.

This statement was not quite accurate, however, because in general
Mappings are only {\bf{potentially}} capable of working in both
directions. In practice, coordinate transformation may only be
feasible in one direction or the other because some functions are not
easily inverted (they may be multi-valued, for instance). Allowance
must be made for this, so each Mapping has two read-only boolean
(integer) attributes, \htmlref{TranForward}{TranForward} and \htmlref{TranInverse}{TranInverse}, which indicate
whether each transformation is available.

A transformation is available if the corresponding attribute is
non-zero, otherwise it is not.\footnote{Most of the Mappings provided
by the AST library work in both directions, although the \htmlref{LutMap}{LutMap} can
behave otherwise.} If you enquire about the value of these attributes,
a value of 0 or 1 is returned.  Attempting to use a Mapping to apply a
transformation which is not available will result in an error.

\subsection{\label{ss:invertingmappings}Inverting Mappings}

An important attribute, common to all Mappings, is the \htmlref{Invert}{Invert}
flag. This is a boolean (integer) attribute that can be assigned a new
value at any time. If it is non-zero, it has the effect of
interchanging the \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}'s input and output coordinates and the
Mapping is then said to be {\em{inverted.}} By default, the Invert
attribute is zero.

There is no magic in this. There is no fancy arithmetic involved in
inverting mathematical functions, for instance. The Invert flag is
simply a switch that interchanges a Mapping's input and output
ports. If it is non-zero, the Mapping's \htmlref{Nin}{Nin} and \htmlref{Nout}{Nout} attributes are
swapped, its \htmlref{TranForward}{TranForward} and \htmlref{TranInverse}{TranInverse} attributes are swapped, and
when you ask for what was once the forward transformation you get the
inverse transformation instead (and {\em{vice versa}}). When you
return the Invert attribute to zero, or clear it, the Mapping returns
to its original behaviour.

Often, the actual value of the Invert attribute is unimportant and you
simply wish to invert its boolean sense, so that what was the
Mapping's input becomes its output and {\em{vice versa.}} This is most
easily accomplished using \htmlref{astInvert}{astInvert}, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstMapping *mapping;

...

astInvert( mapping );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

If the Mapping you have happens to be the wrong way around, astInvert
allows you to correct the problem.

\subsection{Reporting Coordinate Transformations}

We have already seen (\secref{ss:transforming}) how the boolean
(integer) \htmlref{Report}{Report} attribute of a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} works. If it is non-zero, the
operation of transforming a set of coordinates will result in a report
being written to standard output. This will display the coordinate
values before and after transformation. It can save considerable time
during program development by eliminating the need to add loops and
output statements to your program.

In a finished program, however, you should be careful that the Report
attribute is not set to a non-zero value unless you want to see the
output (there may often be rather a lot of this!). To help prevent
unwanted output being produced by accident, the Report attribute is
unusual in that its value is not preserved when a Mapping is copied
using \htmlref{astCopy}{astCopy} (\secref{ss:copyingobjects}). Instead, it reverts to its
default of zero ({\em{i.e.}}\ un-set) in the copy. It also reverts to
zero when a Mapping is written out, {\em{e.g.}}\ to a file using a
\htmlref{Channel}{Channel} (\secref{ss:channels}).

%\subsection{TBW---More on Transforming Coordinates}

\subsection{\label{ss:badcoordinates}Handling Missing (Bad) Coordinate Values}

Even when coordinates can, in principle, be transformed in either
direction by a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}, there may still be instances where specific
coordinate values cannot be handled. For example, the Mapping may be
mathematically intractable ({\em{e.g.}}\ singular) in certain places,
or it may map a subset of one space on to another, so that some points
in one space are not represented in the other.  Sky projections often
show this behaviour, since it is quite common to project only half of
the celestial sphere on to two dimensions, omitting points on the
opposite side of the sky. There are many other examples.

To indicate when coordinates cannot be transformed, for whatever
reason, AST substitutes a special output coordinate value given by the
macro AST\_\_BAD (as defined in the ``ast.h'' header file).  Before
making use of coordinates generated by any of the AST transformation
functions, therefore, you may need to check for the presence of this
value.

Because coordinates with the value AST\_\_BAD can be generated in this
way, all other AST functions are also capable of recognising this
value and handling it appropriately. The coordinate transformation
functions do this by propagating any missing input coordinate
information through to their output.  This means that if you supply
coordinates with the value AST\_\_BAD, the returned coordinates are
also likely to contain this value. Here, for example, is what happens
if you use a \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} (with \htmlref{Zoom}{Zoom} factor 5) to transform such a set of
coordinates:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
(0, 0) --> (0, 0)
(<bad>, 2) --> (<bad>, 10)
(2, 4) --> (10, 20)
(3, 6) --> (15, 30)
(4, <bad>) --> (20, <bad>)
(5, 10) --> (25, 50)
(<bad>, <bad>) --> (<bad>, <bad>)
(7, 14) --> (35, 70)
(8, 16) --> (40, 80)
(9, 18) --> (45, 90)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The AST\_\_BAD value is represented by the string ``$<$bad$>$''. This
is a case of ``garbage in, garbage out'' but at least it's consistent
garbage that you can recognise!

Note how the presence of the AST\_\_BAD value in one input dimension
does not necessarily result in the loss of information for all output
dimensions. Sometimes, such loss will be unavoidable, but in general
an attempt is made to preserve information as far as possible. The
exact behaviour will depend on the Mapping involved.

\subsection{\label{ss:unitmapexample}Example---the UnitMap}

The \htmlref{UnitMap}{UnitMap} is the simplest of Mappings. It is a null \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}. Its
purpose is simply to copy coordinate values, unaltered, from its input
to its output and {\em{vice versa.}}

A UnitMap has no additional attributes beyond those of a basic
Mapping. Its \htmlref{Nin}{Nin} and \htmlref{Nout}{Nout} attributes are always equal and are
specified by the first argument supplied to its constructor. For
example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstUnitMap *unitmap;

...

unitmap = astUnitMap( 2, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

will create a UnitMap that copies 2-dimensional coordinates. Inverting
a UnitMap has no effect beyond changing the value of its \htmlref{Invert}{Invert}
attribute.

The main use of a UnitMap is to allow a Mapping to be supplied when one
is required (as an argument to a function, for example) but you wish
it to leave coordinate values unchanged.

\subsection{\label{ss:permmapexample}Example---the PermMap}

The \htmlref{PermMap}{PermMap} is a rather more complicated \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} than we have met
previously.  Its purpose is to change the order, or number, of
coordinates. It is also able to substitute fixed values for
coordinates.

To illustrate its action, suppose our input coordinates are denoted by
($x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$) in a 4-dimensional space and suppose our output
coordinates are to be ($x_4,x_1,x_2,x_3$). Our PermMap, therefore,
should rotate the coordinate values by one position.

To create such a PermMap, we first set up two integer arrays. One of
these, ``outperm'', controls the selection of input coordinates for
use in the output and the other, ``inperm'', controls selection of
output coordinates for use in the input:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int outperm[ 4 ] = { 4, 1, 2, 3 };
int inperm[ 4 ] = { 2, 3, 4, 1 };
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note that the numbers we store in these arrays are the indices of the
coordinates that we want to select. We have chosen these so that the
forward and inverse transformations will perform complementary
permutations on the coordinates.

The PermMap is then created by passing these arrays to its
constructor, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstPermMap *permmap;

...

permmap = astPermMap( 4, inperm, 4, outperm, NULL, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note that we specify the number of input and output coordinates
separately, but set both to 4 in this example. The resulting PermMap
would have the following effect when used to transform coordinates:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
Forward:
   (1, 2, 3, 4) --> (4, 1, 2, 3)
   (2, 4, 6, 8) --> (8, 2, 4, 6)
   (3, 6, 9, 12) --> (12, 3, 6, 9)
   (4, 8, 12, 16) --> (16, 4, 8, 12)
   (5, 10, 15, 20) --> (20, 5, 10, 15)

Inverse:
   (4, 1, 2, 3) --> (1, 2, 3, 4)
   (8, 2, 4, 6) --> (2, 4, 6, 8)
   (12, 3, 6, 9) --> (3, 6, 9, 12)
   (16, 4, 8, 12) --> (4, 8, 12, 16)
   (20, 5, 10, 15) --> (5, 10, 15, 20)
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

If the number of input and output coordinates are unequal so, also,
will be the size of the ``outperm'' and ``inperm'' arrays. This means,
however, that we cannot fill them with coordinate indices so that they
perform complementary permutations, because one transformation will
lose information (discard a coordinate) that the other cannot recover.
To give an example, consider the following:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int outperm[ 3 ] = { 4, 3, 2 };
int inperm[ 4 ] = { -1, 3, 2, 1 };
double con[ 1 ] = { 99.004 };
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

In this case, the forward transformation will change
($x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$) into ($x_4,x_3,x_2$) and will discard $x_1$. The
inverse transformation restores the original coordinate order, but has
no value to assign to the first coordinate. In this case, the number
entered in the ``inperm'' array is $-$1.

This negative value indicates that the coordinate value should be
obtained by addressing the first element of the ``con'' array
({\em{i.e.}}\ element zero). This array, ignored in the previous
example, may then be used to supply a value for the missing
coordinate.

The constructor function:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
permmap = astPermMap( 4, inperm, 3, outperm, con, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

will then create a PermMap with the following effect when used to
transform coordinates:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
Forward:
   (1, 2, 3, 4) --> (4, 3, 2)
   (2, 4, 6, 8) --> (8, 6, 4)
   (3, 6, 9, 12) --> (12, 9, 6)
   (4, 8, 12, 16) --> (16, 12, 8)
   (5, 10, 15, 20) --> (20, 15, 10)

Inverse:
   (4, 3, 2) --> (99.004, 2, 3, 4)
   (8, 6, 4) --> (99.004, 4, 6, 8)
   (12, 9, 6) --> (99.004, 6, 9, 12)
   (16, 12, 8) --> (99.004, 8, 12, 16)
   (20, 15, 10) --> (99.004, 10, 15, 20)
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

The ``con'' array may contain more than one value if necessary and may
be addressed by both the ``inperm'' and ``outperm'' arrays using
coordinate indices $-$1, $-$2, $-$3,~{\em{etc.}}\ to refer to the
first, second, third,~{\em{etc.}}\ elements.

If there is no suitable replacement value that can be supplied
{\em{via}} the ``con'' array, a value of zero may be entered into the
``outperm'' and/or ``inperm'' arrays. This causes the value AST\_\_BAD
to be used for the affected coordinate (as defined in the ``ast.h''
header file), thus indicating a missing coordinate value
(\secref{ss:badcoordinates}).

The principle use for a PermMap lies in matching a coordinate system
to a data array where there is a choice of storage order for the data.
PermMaps are also useful for discarding unwanted coordinates so as to
reduce the number of dimensions, such as when selecting a ``slice''
from a multi-dimensional array.

\cleardoublepage
\section{\label{ss:cmpmaps}Compound Mappings (CmpMaps)}

We now turn to a rather special form of \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}, the \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap}. The
Mappings we have considered so far have been atomic, in the sense that
they perform pre-defined elementary transformations. A CmpMap,
however, is a compound Mapping. In essence, it is a framework for
containing other Mappings and its purpose is to allow those Mappings
to work together in various combinations while appearing as a single
\htmlref{Object}{Object}. A CmpMap's behaviour is therefore not pre-defined, but is
determined by the other Mappings it contains.

\subsection{\label{ss:seriescmpmap}Combining Mappings in Series}

Consider a simple example based on two 2-dimensional coordinate
systems. Suppose that to convert from one to the other we must swap
the coordinate order and multiply both coordinates by 5, so that the
coordinates ($x_1,x_2$) transform into ($5x_2,5x_1$). This can be done
in two stages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Apply a \htmlref{PermMap}{PermMap} (\secref{ss:permmapexample}) to swap the
coordinate order.

\item Apply a \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} (\secref{ss:transforming}) to multiply both
coordinate values by the constant 5.
\end{enumerate}

The PermMap and ZoomMap are then said to operate {\em{in series,}}
because they are applied sequentially
({\em{c.f.}}\ Figure~\ref{fig:seriescmpmap}).  We can create a \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap}
that applies these Mappings in series as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
AstCmpMap *cmpmap;
AstPermMap *permmap;
AstZoomMap *zoommap;

...

/* Create the individual Mappings. */
{
   int inperm[ 2 ] = { 2, 1 };
   int outperm[ 2 ] = { 2, 1 };
   permmap = astPermMap( 2, inperm, 2, outperm, NULL, "" );
}
zoommap = astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "" )

/* Combine them in series. */
cmpmap = astCmpMap( permmap, zoommap, 1, "" );

/* Annul the individual Mapping pointers. */
permmap = astAnnul( permmap );
zoommap = astAnnul( zoommap );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, the third argument (1) of the constructor function \htmlref{astCmpMap}{astCmpMap}
indicates ``in series''.

When used to transform coordinates in the forward direction, the
resulting CmpMap will apply the first component \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} (the PermMap)
and then the second one (the ZoomMap). When transforming in the
inverse direction, it will apply the second one (in the inverse
direction) and then the first one (also in the inverse direction).  In
general, although not in this particular example, the order in which
the two component Mappings are supplied is significant. Clearly, also,
the \htmlref{Nout}{Nout} attribute (number of output coordinates) for the first
Mapping must equal the \htmlref{Nin}{Nin} attribute (number of input coordinates) for
the second one.

\subsection{Combining Mappings in Parallel}

Connecting two Mappings in series (\secref{ss:seriescmpmap}) is not the
only way of combining them. The alternative, {\em{in parallel,}}
involves applying the two Mappings at once but on different subsets of
the coordinate values.

Consider, for example, a set of 3-dimensional coordinates and suppose
we wish to transform them by swapping the first two coordinate values
and multiplying the final one by 5, so that ($x_1,x_2,x_3$) transforms
into ($x_2,x_1,5x_3$). Again, we can perform each of these steps
individually using exactly the same \htmlref{PermMap}{PermMap} and \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} as used
earlier (\secref{ss:seriescmpmap}). In this case, however, these
individual Mappings are applied in parallel
({\em{c.f.}}\ Figure~\ref{fig:parallelcmpmap}).

Creating a \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap} for this purpose is also very simple:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
cmpmap = astCmpMap( permmap, zoommap, 0, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The only difference is that the third argument of \htmlref{astCmpMap}{astCmpMap} is now
zero, meaning ``in parallel''.

As before, the order in which the two component Mappings are supplied
is significant. The first one acts on the lower-numbered input
coordinate values (however many it needs) and produces the
lower-numbered output coordinates, while the second \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} acts on
the higher-numbered input coordinates (however many remain) and
generates the remaining higher-numbered output coordinates.  When the
CmpMap transforms coordinates in the inverse direction, both component
Mappings are applied to the same coordinates, but in the inverse
direction.

Note that the \htmlref{Nin}{Nin} and \htmlref{Nout}{Nout} attributes of the component Mappings
({\em{i.e.}}\ the numbers of input and output coordinates) will sum to
give the Nin and Nout attributes of the overall CmpMap.

\subsection{\label{ss:cmpmapcomponents}The Component Mappings}

A \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap} does not store copies of its component Mappings, but simply
holds pointers to them. In the example above
(\secref{ss:seriescmpmap}), we were free to annul the individual
\htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} pointers after creating the CmpMap because the pointers held
internally by the CmpMap increased the reference count (\htmlref{RefCount}{RefCount}
attribute) of each component Mapping by one. The individual components
are therefore not deleted by \htmlref{astAnnul}{astAnnul}, but retained until the CmpMap
itself is deleted and annuls the pointers it holds. Consistent use of
astAnnul (\secref{ss:annullingpointers}) and/or pointer contexts
(\secref{ss:contexts}) will therefore ensure that all Objects are
deleted at the appropriate time.

Note that access to a CmpMap's component Mappings is not generally
available unless pointers to them are retained when the CmpMap is
created. If such pointers are retained, then subsequent modifications
to the individual components can be used to indirectly modify the
behaviour of the overall CmpMap.

There is an important exception to this, however, because a CmpMap
retains a copy of the initial \htmlref{Invert}{Invert} flag settings of each of its
components and uses these in order to ignore any subsequent external
changes. This means that you may invert either component Mapping
before inserting it into a CmpMap and need not worry if you un-invert
it again later. The CmpMap's behaviour will not be affected by the
later action.

\subsection{\label{ss:complexcmpmap}Creating More Complex Mappings}

Because a \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap} is itself a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}, any existing CmpMap can
substitute (\secref{ss:objecthierarchy}) as a component Mapping when
constructing a new CmpMap using \htmlref{astCmpMap}{astCmpMap}. This has the effect of
nesting one CmpMap inside another and opens up many new possibilities.
For example, combining three Mappings in series can be accomplished as
follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstMapping *map1, *map2, *map3;

...

cmpmap = astCmpMap( map1, astCmpMap( map2, map3, 1, "" ), 1, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The way in which the individual component Mappings are grouped within
the nested CmpMaps is not usually important.

A similar technique can be used to combine multiple Mappings in
parallel and, of course, mixed series and parallel combinations are
also possible (Figure~\ref{fig:complexcmpmap}).  There is no built-in
limit to how many CmpMaps may be nested in this way, so this mechanism
provides an indefinitely extensible method of building complex
Mappings out of the elemental building blocks provided by AST.

In practice, you might not need to construct such complex CmpMaps
yourself very frequently, but they will often be returned by AST
routines.  Nested CmpMaps underlie the library's entire ability to
represent a wide range of different coordinate transformations.

\subsection{\label{ss:cmpmapexample}Example---Transforming Between Two Calibrated Images}

Consider, as a practical example of CmpMaps, two images of the
sky. Suppose that for each image we have a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which converts from
pixel coordinates to a standard celestial coordinate system, say
FK5~(J2000.0). If we wish to inter-compare these images, we can do so
by using this celestial coordinate system to align them. That is, we
first convert from pixel coordinates in the first image into FK5
coordinates and we then convert from FK5 coordinates into pixel
coordinates in the second image.

If ``mapa'' and ``mapb'' are pointers to our two original Mappings, we
could form a \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap} which transforms directly between the pixel
coordinates of the first and second images by combining these
Mappings, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstCmpMap *alignmap;
AstMapping *mapa, *mapb;

...

astInvert( mapb );
alignmap = astCmpMap( mapa, mapb, 1, "" );
astInvert( mapb );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, we have used \htmlref{astInvert}{astInvert} (\secref{ss:invertingmappings}) to invert
``mapb'' before inserting it into the CmpMap because, as supplied, it
converted in the wrong direction. Afterwards, we invert it again to
return it to its original state. The CmpMap, however, will ignore this
subsequent change (\secref{ss:cmpmapcomponents}).

The forward transformation of the resulting CmpMap will now transform
from pixel coordinates in the first image to pixel coordinates in the
second image, while its inverse transformation will convert in the
opposite direction.

\subsection{\label{ss:overcomplexcmpmaps}Over-Complex Compound Mappings}

While a \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap} provides a very flexible way of constructing
arbitrarily complex Mappings (\secref{ss:complexcmpmap}), it
unfortunately also provides an opportunity for representing simple
Mappings in complex ways. Sometimes, unnecessary complexity can be
difficult to avoid but can obscure important simplifications.

Consider the example above (\secref{ss:cmpmapexample}), in which we
inter-related two images of the sky {\em{via}} a CmpMap.  If the two
images turned out to be simply offset from each other by a shift along
each pixel axis, then this approach would align them correctly, but it
would be inefficient. This is because it would introduce unnecessary
and expensive transformations to and from an intermediate celestial
coordinate system, whereas a simple shift of pixel origin would
suffice.

Recognising that a simpler and more efficient solution exists
obviously requires a little more than simply joining two Mappings
end-to-end. We must also determine whether the resulting CmpMap is
more complex than it needs to be, {\em{i.e.}}\ contains redundant
information. If it is, we then need a way to simplify it.

The problem is not always just one of efficiency, however. Sometimes
we may also need to know something about the actual form a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}
takes---{\em{i.e.}}\ the nature of the operations it performs.
Unnecessary complexity can obscure this, but such complexity can
easily accumulate during normal data processing.

For example, a Mapping that transforms pixel coordinates into
positions on the sky might be repeatedly modified as changes are made
to the shape and size of the image. Typically, on each occasion,
another Mapping will be concatenated to reflect what has happened to
the image. This could soon make it difficult to discern the overall
nature of the transformation from the complex CmpMap that
accumulates. If only shifts of origin were involved on each occasion,
however, they could be combined into a single shift which could be
represented much more simply.

Suppose we now wanted to represent our image's celestial coordinate
calibration using FITS conventions (\secref{ss:foreignfits}). This
requires AST to determine whether the Mapping which relates pixel
coordinate to sky positions conforms to the FITS model (for example,
whether it is equivalent to applying a single set of shifts and scale
factors followed by a map projection). Clearly, there is an important
use here for some means of simplifying the internal structure of a
CmpMap.

\subsection{\label{ss:simplifyingcmpmaps}Simplifying Compound Mappings}

The ability to simplify compound Mappings is provided by the
\htmlref{astSimplify}{astSimplify} function. This function encapsulates a number of
heuristics for converting Mappings, or combinations of Mappings within
a \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap}, into simpler, equivalent ones. When applied to a CmpMap,
astSimplify tries to reduce the number of individual Mappings within
it by merging neighbouring component Mappings together. It will do
this with both series and parallel combinations of Mappings, or both,
and will handle CmpMaps nested to any depth
(\secref{ss:complexcmpmap}).

\begin{latexonly}
   To illustrate how astSimplify works, consider the combination of
   Mappings shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simplifyexample}.
   \begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{sun211_figures/simpexamp.eps}
   \caption{An over-complex compound \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}, consisting of PermMaps,
   ZoomMaps and a \htmlref{UnitMap}{UnitMap}, which can be simplified to become a single
   UnitMap.  The enclosing nested CmpMaps have been omitted for clarity.}
   \label{fig:simplifyexample}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   To illustrate how astSimplify works, consider the combination of
   Mappings shown in the Figure below.
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}
   \label{fig:simplifyexample}
   \includegraphics[scale=1.1]{sun211_figures/simpexamp.eps}
   \caption{An over-complex compound Mapping, consisting of PermMaps,
   ZoomMaps and a UnitMap, which can be simplified to become a single
   UnitMap.  The enclosing nested CmpMaps have been omitted for clarity.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}
If this were contained in a CmpMap, it could be simplified as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstMapping *simpler;

...

simpler = astSimplify( cmpmap );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

In this case, the result would be a simple 3-dimensional UnitMap (the
identity Mapping).  To reach this conclusion, astSimplify will have
made a number of deductions, roughly as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The two 2-dimensional ZoomMaps in series are equivalent to a
single \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} with a combined \htmlref{Zoom}{Zoom} factor of unity. This, in turn, is
equivalent to a 2-dimensional UnitMap.

\item This UnitMap in parallel with the other 1-dimensional UnitMap is
equivalent to a single 3-dimensional UnitMap. This UnitMap, sandwiched
between any other pair of Mappings, can then be eliminated.

\item The remaining two PermMaps in series are equivalent to a single
3-dimensional \htmlref{PermMap}{PermMap}. When these are combined, the resulting PermMap
is found to be equivalent to a 3-dimensional UnitMap.
\end{enumerate}

This example is a little contrived, but illustrates how astSimplify
can deal with even quite complicated compound Mappings through a
series of incremental simplifications. Where possible, this will
result in either a simpler compound Mapping or, if feasible, an atomic
(non-compound) Mapping, as here. If no simplification is possible,
astSimplify will just return a pointer to the original Mapping.

Although astSimplify cannot identify every simplification that is
theoretically possible, sufficient rules are included to deal with the
most common and important cases.

\section{\label{ss:frames}Representing Coordinate Systems (Frames)}

An AST \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} is an \htmlref{Object}{Object} that is used to represent a coordinate
system. Contrast this with a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} (\secref{ss:mappings}), which is
used to describe how to convert between coordinate systems. The two
concepts are complementary and we will see how they work together in
\secref{ss:framesets}.

In this section we will discuss only basic Frames, which represent
Cartesian coordinate systems. More specialised types of Frame
({\em{e.g.}}\ the \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}, which represents celestial coordinate
systems) are covered later (\secref{ss:skyframes}) and, naturally,
inherit the properties and behaviour of the simple Frames discussed
here.

\subsection{The Frame Model}

The best way to think about a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} is like the frame that you would
plot around a graph. In two dimensions, you would have an ``$x$'' and
a ``$y$'' axis, a title on the graph and labels on the axes, together
with an indication of the physical units being plotted. The values
marked along each axis would be formatted in a human-readable way. The
frame around a graph therefore defines a coordinate space within which
you can locate points, draw lines, calculate distances, {\em{etc.}}

An AST Frame works in much the same way, embodying all of these
concepts and a few more. It also allows any number of axes, which
means that a Frame can represent coordinate systems with any number of
dimensions. You specify how many when you create it.

Remember that the basic Frame we are considering here is completely
general.  It knows nothing of celestial coordinates, for example, and
all its axes are equivalent. It can be adapted to describe any general
purpose Cartesian coordinate system by setting its attributes, such as
its \htmlref{Title}{Title} and axis Labels, {\em{etc.}}\ to appropriate values.

\subsection{\label{ss:creatingframes}Creating a Frame}

Creating a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} is straightforward and follows the usual pattern:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
astFrame *frame;

...

frame = astFrame( 2, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The first argument of the \htmlref{astFrame}{astFrame} constructor function specifies the
number of axes which the Frame should have.

\subsection{\label{ss:frameasmapping}Using a Frame as a Mapping}

We should briefly point out that the \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} we created above
(\secref{ss:creatingframes}) is also a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}
(\secref{ss:mappingclass}) and therefore inherits the properties and
behaviour common to other Mappings.

One way to see this is to set the Frame's \htmlref{Report}{Report} attribute (inherited
from the Mapping class) to a non-zero value and pass the Frame pointer
to a coordinate transformation function, such as \htmlref{astTran2}{astTran2}.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double xin[ 5 ] = { 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 };
double yin[ 5 ] = { 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 };
double xout[ 5 ];
double yout[ 5 ];

...

astSet( frame, "Report=1" );
astTran2( frame, 5, xin, yin, 1, xout, yout );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The resulting output might then look like this:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
(1, 2) --> (1, 2)
(2, 4) --> (2, 4)
(3, 6) --> (3, 6)
(4, 8) --> (4, 8)
(5, 10) --> (5, 10)
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This is not very exciting because a Frame implements an identity
transformation just like a \htmlref{UnitMap}{UnitMap}
(\secref{ss:unitmapexample}). However, it illustrates that a Frame can
be used as a Mapping and that its \htmlref{Nin}{Nin} and \htmlref{Nout}{Nout} attributes are both
equal to the number of Frame axes.

When we consider more specialised Frames
({\em{e.g.}}~\secref{ss:framesets}), we will see that using them as
Mappings can be very useful indeed.

\subsection{\label{ss:frameaxisattributes}Frame Axis Attributes}

Frames have a number of attributes which can take multiple values, one
for each axis. These separate values are identified by appending the
axis number in parentheses to the attribute name. For example, the
Label(1) attribute is a character string containing the label which
appears on the first axis.

\htmlref{Axis}{Axis} attributes are accessed in the same way as all other attributes
(\secref{ss:gettingattributes}, \secref{ss:settingattributes} and
\secref{ss:defaultingattributes}). For example, the Label on the second
axis might be obtained as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
const char *label;

...

label = astGetC( frame, "Label(2)" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Other attribute access functions (astSetX, \htmlref{astTest}{astTest} and \htmlref{astClear}{astClear}) may
also be applied to axis attributes in the same way.

If the axis number is stored in a program variable, then its value
must be formatted to generate a suitable attribute name before using
this to access the attribute itself. For example, the following will
print out the Label value for each axis of a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>
char name[ 18 ];
int iaxis, naxes;

...

naxes = astGetI( frame, "Naxes" );
for ( iaxis = 1; iaxis <= naxes; iaxis++ ) {
   (void) sprintf( name, "Label(%d)", iaxis );
   label = astGetC( frame, name );
   (void) printf( "Label %2d: %s\n", iaxis, label );
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note the use of the \htmlref{Naxes}{Naxes} attribute to determine the number of Frame
axes.

The output from this might look like the following:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
Label  1: Axis 1
Label  2: Axis 2
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

In this case, the Frame's default axis Labels have been revealed as
rather un-exciting. Normally, you would set much more useful values,
typically when you create the Frame---perhaps something like:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
frame = astFrame( 2, "Label(1)=Offset from centre of field,"
                     "Unit(1) =mm,"
                     "Label(2)=Transmission coefficient,"
                     "Unit(2) =%" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, we have also set the (character string) Unit attribute for each
axis to describe the physical units represented on that axis. All the
attribute assignments have been combined into a single string,
separated by commas.

\subsection{\label{ss:frameattributes}Frame Attributes}

We will now briefly outline the various attributes associated with a
\htmlref{Frame}{Frame} (this is, of course, in addition to those inherited from the
\htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} class). We will not delve too deeply into the details of each
attribute, for which you should consult the appropriate description in
\appref{ss:attributedescriptions}. Instead, we aim simply to sketch
the range of facilities available:

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item[\htmlref{Naxes}{Naxes}]\mbox{}\\
A read-only integer giving the number of Frame axes.

\item[\htmlref{Title}{Title}]\mbox{}\\
A string describing the coordinate system which the Frame represents.

\item[\htmlref{Label(axis)}{Labelaxis}]\mbox{}\\
A label string for each axis.

\item[\htmlref{Unit(axis)}{Unitaxis}]\mbox{}\\
A string describing the physical units on each axis.

\item[\htmlref{Symbol(axis)}{Symbolaxis}]\mbox{}\\
A string containing a ``short form'' symbol ({\em{e.g.}}\ like ``X''
or ``Y'') used to represent the quantity plotted on each axis.

\item[\htmlref{Digits/Digits(axis)}{DigitsDigitsaxis}]\mbox{}\\
The preferred number of digits of precision to be used when formatting
values for display on each axis.

\item[\htmlref{Format(axis)}{Formataxis}]\mbox{}\\
A string containing a {\em{format specifier}} which determines exactly
how values should be formatted for display on each axis
(\secref{ss:formattingaxisvalues}). If this attribute is un-set, the
formatting is based on the Digits value, otherwise the Format string
over-rides the Digits value.

\item[\htmlref{Direction(axis)}{Directionaxis}]\mbox{}\\
A boolean (integer) value which indicates in which direction each axis
should be plotted. If it is non-zero (the default), the axis should be
plotted in the conventional direction---{\em{i.e.}}\ increasing to the
right for the abscissa and increasing upwards for the ordinate. If it
is zero, the axis should be plotted in reverse.  This attribute is
provided as a hint only and programs are free to ignore it if they
wish.

\item[\htmlref{Domain}{Domain}]\mbox{}\\
A character string which identifies the {\em{physical domain}} to
which the Frame's coordinate system applies. The primary purpose of
this attribute is to prevent unwanted conversions from occurring
between coordinate systems which are not related. Its use is described
in more detail in \secref{ss:framedomains}.
\end{description}
\end{quote}

There are also some further Frame attributes, not described above,
which are important when Frames are used as templates to search for
other Frames. Their use goes beyond the present discussion.
%TBW---Add reference here.

\subsection{\label{ss:formattingaxisvalues}Formatting Axis Values}

The coordinate values associated with each axis of a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} are stored
({\em{e.g.}}\ within your program) as double values. The Frame class
therefore provides a function, \htmlref{astFormat}{astFormat}, to convert these values into
formatted strings for display:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
const char *string
double value;

...

string = astFormat( frame, iaxis, value );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, the astFormat function is passed a Frame pointer, the number of
an axis (``iaxis'') and a double precision value to format
(``value''). It returns a pointer to character string containing the
formatted value.
\label{ss:formattingwithdigits}

By default, the formatting applied will be determined by the Frame's
Digits attribute and will normally display results with seven digits
of precision (corresponding approximately to the C ``float'' data type
on many machines). Setting a different Digits value, however, allows
you to adjust the precision as necessary to suit the accuracy of the
coordinate data you are processing.  If finer control is needed, it is
also possible to set a Digits value for each individual axis by
appending an axis number to the attribute name
({\em{e.g.}}\ ``Digits(2)''). If this is done, it over-rides the
effect of the Frame's main Digits value for that axis.

Even finer control is possible by setting the (character string)
Format attribute for a Frame axis. The string given should contain a C
{\em{format specifier}} which explicitly determines how the values on
that axis should be formatted. This will over-ride the effects of any
Digits value. Any valid ``printf'' format specifier may be used so
long as it consumes exactly one double value.

When setting Format values, remember that the ``\%'' which appears in
the format specifier may need to be doubled to ``\%\%'' if you are
using a function (such as \htmlref{astSet}{astSet}) which interprets ``printf'' format
specifiers itself.

It is recommended that you use astFormat whenever you display
formatted coordinate values, even although you could format them
yourself using ``sprintf''. This is because it puts the Frame in
control of formatting. When you start to handle more elaborate Frames
(representing, say, celestial coordinates), you will need different
formatting methods. This approach delivers them without any change to
your software.

You should also consider regularly using the \htmlref{astNorm}{astNorm} function,
described below (\secref{ss:normalising}), for any values that will be
made visible to the user of your software.

\subsection{\label{ss:normalising}Normalising Frame Coordinates}

The function \htmlref{astNorm}{astNorm} is provided to cope with the fact that some
coordinate systems do not extend indefinitely in all directions. Some
may have boundaries, outside which coordinates are meaningless, while
others wrap around on themselves, so that after a certain distance you
return to the beginning again (coordinate systems based on circles and
spheres, for instance). A basic \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} has no such complications, but
other more specialised Frames (such as SkyFrames, representing the
celestial sphere---\secref{ss:skyframes}) do.

The role played by astNorm is to {\em{normalise}} any arbitrary set of
coordinates by converting them into a set which is ``within bounds'',
interpreted according to the particular Frame in question. For
example, on the celestial sphere, a right ascension value of 24~hours
or more can have a suitable multiple of 24~hours subtracted without
affecting its meaning and astNorm would perform this task. Similarly,
negative values of right ascension would have a multiple of 24~hours
added, so that the result lies in the range zero to 24~hours. The
coordinates in question are modified in place by astNorm, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double point[ 2 ];

...

astNorm( frame, point );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

If the coordinates supplied are initially OK, as they would always be
with a basic Frame, then they are returned unchanged.

Because the main purpose of astNorm is to convert coordinates into the
preferred range for human consumption, its use is almost always
appropriate immediately before formatting coordinate values for
display using \htmlref{astFormat}{astFormat} (\secref{ss:formattingaxisvalues}). Even if
the Frame in question does not restrict the range of coordinates, so
that astNorm does nothing, using it will allow you to process other
more specialised Frames, where normalisation is important, without
changing your software.

\subsection{\label{ss:unformattingaxisvalues}Reading Formatted Axis Values}

The process of converting a formatted coordinate value for a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}
axis, such as might be produced by \htmlref{astFormat}{astFormat}
(\secref{ss:formattingaxisvalues}), back into a numerical (double)
value ready for processing is performed by \htmlref{astUnformat}{astUnformat}.  However,
although this process is essentially the inverse of that performed by
astFormat, there are a number of additional difficulties that must be
addressed in practice.

The main use for astUnformat is in reading formatted coordinate values
which have been entered by the user of a program, or read from a
file. As such, we can rarely assume that the values are neatly
formatted in the way that astFormat would produce. Instead, it is
usually desirable to allow considerable flexibility in the form of
input that can be accommodated, so as to permit ``free-format'' data
input by the user. In addition, we may need to extract individual
coordinate values embedded in other textual data.

Underlying these requirements is the root difficulty that the textual
format used to represent a coordinate value will depend on the class
of Frame we are considering. For example, for a basic Frame,
astUnformat may have to read a value like ``1.25e-6'', whereas for a
more specialised Frame representing celestial coordinates it may have
to handle a value like ``-07d~49m~13s''. Of course, the format might
also depend on which axis is being considered.

Ideally, we would like to write software that can handle any kind of
Frame. However, this makes it a little more difficult to analyse
textual input data to extract individual coordinate values, since we
cannot make assumptions about how the values are formatted. It would
not be safe, for example, simply to assume that the values being read
are separated by white space. This is not just because they might be
separated by some other character, but also because celestial
coordinate values might themselves contain spaces. In fact, to be
completely safe, we cannot make any assumptions about how a formatted
coordinate value is separated from the surrounding text, except that
it should be separated in some way which is not ambiguous.

This is the very basic assumption upon which astUnformat works. It is
invoked as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int n;

...

n = astUnformat( frame, iaxis, string, &value );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

It is supplied with a Frame pointer (``frame''), the number of an axis
(``iaxis'') and a character string to be read (``string''). If it
succeeds in reading a value, astUnformat returns the resulting
coordinate to the address supplied {\em{via}} the final argument
(``\&value''). The returned function value indicates how many
characters were read from the string in order to obtain this result.

The string is read as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Any white space at the start is skipped over.

\item Further characters are considered, one at a time, until the next
character no longer matches any of the acceptable forms of input
(given the characters that precede it). The longest sequence of
characters which matches is then considered ``read''.

\item If a suitable sequence of characters was read successfully, it
is converted into a coordinate value which is returned. Any white
space following this sequence is then skipped over and the total
number of characters consumed is returned as the function value.

\item If the sequence of characters read is empty, or insufficient to
define a coordinate value, then the string does not contain a value to
read. In this case, the read is aborted and astUnformat returns a
function value of zero and no coordinate value.  However, it returns
without error.
\end{enumerate}

Note that failing to read a coordinate value does not constitute an
error, at least so far as astUnformat is concerned. However, an error
can occur if the sequence of characters read appears to have the
correct form but cannot be converted into a valid coordinate
value. Typically, this will be because it violates some constraint,
such as a limit on the value of one of its fields. The resulting error
message will give details.

For any given Frame axis, astUnformat does not necessarily always use
the same algorithm for converting the sequence of characters it reads
into a coordinate value. This is because some forms of input
(particularly free-format input) can be ambiguous and might be
interpreted in several ways depending on the context. For example, the
celestial longitude ``12:34:56.7'' could represent an angle in degrees
or a right ascension in hours. To decide which to use, astUnformat may
examine the Frame's attributes and, in particular, the appropriate
\htmlref{Format(axis)}{Formataxis} string which is used by astFormat when formatting
coordinate values (\secref{ss:formattingaxisvalues}). This is done in
order that astFormat and astUnformat should complement each other---so
that formatting a value and then un-formatting it will yield the
original value, subject to any rounding error.

To give a simple (but crucially incomplete!) example, consider reading
a value for the axis of a basic Frame, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
n = astUnformat( frame, iaxis, " 1.5e6   -99.0", &value );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

astUnformat will skip over the initial space in the string supplied
and then examine each successive character. It will accept the
sequence ``1.5e6'' as input, but reject the space which follows
because it does not form part of the format of a floating point
number. It will then convert the characters ``1.5e6'' into a
coordinate value and skip over the three spaces which follow them. The
returned function value will therefore be 9, equal to the total number
of characters consumed. This result may be used to address the string
during a subsequent read, so as to commence reading at the start of
``-99.0''.

Most importantly, however, note that if the user of a program
mistakenly enters the string ``~1.5r6\ldots'' instead of
``~1.5e6\ldots'', a coordinate value of 1.5 and a function result of 4
will be returned, because the ``r'' would prematurely terminate the
attempt to read the value. Because this sort of mistake does not
automatically result in an error but can produce incorrect results, it
is {\bf{vital}} to check the returned function value to ensure that
the expected number of characters have been read.\footnote{Anyone who
seriously uses the C run time library ``scanf'' function will know
about the need for this check!}  For example, if the string is
expected to contain exactly one value, and nothing else, then the
following would suffice:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
n = astUnformat( frame, iaxis, string, &value );
if ( astOK ) {
   if ( string[ n ] || !n ) {
      <error in input data>
   } else {
      <value read correctly>
   }
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

If astUnformat does not detect an error itself, we check that it has
read to the end-of-string and consumed at least one character (which
traps the case of a zero-length input string). If this reveals an
error, the value of ``n'' indicates where it occurred.

Another common requirement is to obtain a position by reading a list
of coordinates from a string which contains one value for each axis of
a Frame. We assume that the values are separated in some unambiguous
manner, perhaps using white space and/or some unspecified
single-character separator. The choice of separator is up to the data
supplier, who must choose it so as not to conflict with the format of
the coordinate values, but our software does not need to know what it
is. The following is a template algorithm for reading data in this
form:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
const char *s;
double values[ 10 ];

...

/* Initialise a string pointer. */
s = string;

/* Obtain the number of Frame axes and loop through them. */
naxes = astGetI( frame, "Naxes" );
for ( iaxis = 1; iaxis <= naxes; iaxis++ ) {

/* Attempt to read a value for this axis. */
   n = astUnformat( frame, iaxis, s, &values[ iaxis - 1 ] );

/* If nothing was read and this is not the first axis or the
   end-of-string, try stepping over a separator and reading again. */
   if ( !n && ( iaxis > 1 ) && *s )
      n = astUnformat( frame, iaxis, ++s, &values[ iaxis - 1 ] );

/* Quit if nothing was read, otherwise move on to the next value. */
   if ( !n ) break;
   s += n;
}

/* Check for possible errors. */
if ( astOK ) {
   if ( *s || !n ) {
      <error in input data>
   } else {
      <values read correctly>
   }
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

In this case, ``s'' will point to the location of any input error.

Note that this algorithm is insensitive to the precise format of the
data and will therefore work with any class of Frame and any
reasonably unambiguous input data. For example, here is a range of
suitable input data for a 3-dimensional basic Frame:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
1 2.5 3
3.1,3.2,3.3
1.5, 2.6, -9.9e2
-1.1+0.4-1.8
    .1/.2/.3
 44.0 ; 55.1 -14
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

\subsection{\label{ss:permutingaxes}Permuting Frame Axes}

Once a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} has been created, it is not possible to change the number
of axes it contains, but it is possible to change the order in which
these axes occur. To do so, an integer {\em{permutation array}} is
filled with the numbers of the axes so as to specify the new order,
{\em{e.g:}}

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int perm[ 2 ] = { 2, 1 };
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

In this case, the axes of a 2-dimensional Frame could be interchanged
by passing this permutation array to the \htmlref{astPermAxes}{astPermAxes} function. That
is, an ($x_1,x_2$) coordinate system would be changed into an
($x_2,x_1$) coordinate system by:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astPermAxes( frame, perm );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

If the axes are permuted more than once, the effects are cumulative.
You are, of course, not restricted to Frames with only two axes.

\subsection{Selecting Frame Axes}

An alternative to changing the number of \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} axes, which is not
allowed, is to create a new Frame by selecting axes from an existing
one. The method of doing this is very similar to the way \htmlref{astPermAxes}{astPermAxes}
is used (\secref{ss:permutingaxes}), in that we supply an integer
array filled with the numbers of the axes we want, in their new
order. In this case, however, the number of array elements need not
equal the number of Frame axes.

For example, we could select axes 3 and 2 (in that order) from a
3-dimensional Frame as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astFrame *frame1, *frame2;
astMapping *mapping;
int pick[ 2 ] = { 3, 2 };

...

frame2 = astPickAxes( frame1, 2, pick, &mapping );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This would return a pointer to a 2-dimensional Frame (``frame2'')
which contains the information associated with axes 3 and 2, in that
order, from the original Frame (``frame1''). The original Frame is not
altered by this process. Beware, however, that the axis information
may still be shared by both Frames, so if you wish to alter either of
them independently you may first need to use \htmlref{astCopy}{astCopy}
(\secref{ss:copyingobjects}) to make an independent copy.

In addition to the new Frame pointer, \htmlref{astPickAxes}{astPickAxes} will also return a
pointer to a new \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} {\em{via}} its fourth argument (you may supply a
NULL pointer as an argument if you do not want this Mapping).  This
Mapping will inter-relate the two Frames. By this we mean that its
forward transformation will convert coordinates originally in the
coordinate system represented by ``frame1'' into that represented by
``frame2'', while its inverse transformation will convert in the
opposite direction. In this particular case, the Mapping would be a
\htmlref{PermMap}{PermMap} (\secref{ss:permmapexample}) and would implement the following
transformations:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
Forward:
   (1, 2, 3) --> (3, 2)
   (2, 4, 6) --> (6, 4)
   (3, 6, 9) --> (9, 6)
   (4, 8, 12) --> (12, 8)
   (5, 10, 15) --> (15, 10)

Inverse:
   (3, 2) --> (<bad>, 2, 3)
   (6, 4) --> (<bad>, 4, 6)
   (9, 6) --> (<bad>, 6, 9)
   (12, 8) --> (<bad>, 8, 12)
   (15, 10) --> (<bad>, 10, 15)
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This is our first introduction to the idea of inter-relating pairs of
Frames {\em{via}} a Mapping, but this will assume a central role later on.

Note that when using astPickAxes, it is also possible to request more
axes than there were in the original Frame. This will involve
selecting axes from the original Frame that do not exist. To do this,
the corresponding axis number (in the ``pick'' array) should be set to
zero and the effect is to introduce an additional new axis which is
not derived from the original Frame. This axis will have default
values for all its attributes. You will need to do this because
astPickAxes does not allow you to select any of the original axes more
than once.\footnote{It will probably not be obvious why this
restriction is necessary, but consider creating a Frame with one
longitude axis and two latitude axes. Which latitude axis should be
associated with the longitude axis?}

\subsection{\label{ss:distanceandoffset}Calculating Distances and Offsets}

Two complementary functions are provided for use with Frames to allow
you to find the distance between two points and to offset a specified
distance along a line joining two points. In essence, these functions
define the metric of the coordinate space which the \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}
represents. In the case of a basic Frame, this is a Cartesian metric.

The first of these functions, \htmlref{astDistance}{astDistance}, returns a double distance
value when supplied with the Frame coordinates of two points. For
example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double dist;
double point1[ 2 ] = { 0.0, 0.0 };
double point2[ 2 ] = { 1.0, 1.0 };

...

dist = astDistance( frame, point1, point2 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This calculates the distance between the origin (0,0) and a point at
position (1,1). In this case, the result, as you would expect, is
$\surd{2}$. However, this is only true for the Cartesian coordinate
system which a basic Frame represents. In general, astDistance will
calculate the geodesic distance between the two points, so that with a
more specialised Frame (such as a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}, representing the celestial
sphere) a great-circle distance might be returned.

The \htmlref{astOffset}{astOffset} function is really the inverse of astDistance. Given two
points in a Frame, it calculates the coordinates of a third point
which is offset a specified distance away from the first point along
the geodesic joining it to the second one. For example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double point1[ 2 ] = { 0.0, 0.0 };
double point2[ 2 ] = { 1.0, 1.0 };
double point3[ 2 ];

...

astOffset( frame, point1. point2, 0.5, point3 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This would fill the ``point3'' array with the coordinates of a point
which is offset 0.5 units away from the origin (0,0) in the direction
of the position (1,1). Again, this is a simple result in a Cartesian
Frame, as varying the offset will trace out a straight line. On the
celestial sphere, however ({\em{e.g.}}\ using a SkyFrame), it would
trace out a great circle.

\subsection{\label{ss:framedomains}The Domain Attribute}

The \htmlref{Domain}{Domain} attribute is one of the most important properties of a
\htmlref{Frame}{Frame}, although the concept it expresses can sometimes seem a little
subtle.  We will introduce it here, but its true value will probably
not become apparent until later (\secref{ss:framesetconverting}).

To understand the need for the Domain attribute, consider using
different Frames to represent the following different coordinate
systems associated with a CCD image:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A coordinate system based on pixel numbers.

\item Positions on the CCD chip, measured in $\mu$m.

\item Positions in the focal plane of the telescope, measured in mm.

\item A celestial coordinate system, measured in radians.
\end{enumerate}

If we had two such CCD images, we might legitimately want to align
them pixel-for-pixel ({\em{i.e.}}\ using the coordinate system based
on pixel numbers) in order to, say, divide by a flat-field exposure.
We might similarly consider aligning them using any of the other
coordinate systems so as to achieve different results. For example, we
might consider merging separate images from a CCD mosaic by using
focal plane positions.

It would obviously not be legitimate, however, to directly compare
positions in one image measured in pixels with positions in the other
measured in mm, nor to equate chip positions in $\mu$m with sky
coordinates in radians. If we wanted to inter-compare these
coordinates, we would need to do it indirectly, using other
information based on the experimental set-up. For instance, we might
need to know the size of the pixels expressed in mm and the
orientation of the CCD chip in the focal plane.

Note that it is not simply the difference in physical units which
prevents certain coordinates from being directly inter-compared
(because the appropriate unit scaling factors could be included
without any additional information). Neither is it the fact that
different coordinate systems are in use (because we could legitimately
inter-compare two different celestial coordinate systems without any
extra information).  Instead, it is the different nature of the
coordinate spaces to which these coordinate systems have been applied.

We normally express this by saying that the coordinate systems apply
to different {\em{physical domains}}. Although we may establish
{\em{ad hoc}} relationships between coordinates in different physical
domains, they are not intrinsically related to each other and we need
to supply extra information before we can convert coordinates between
them.

In AST, the role of the (character string) Domain attribute is to
assign Frames to their respective physical domains. The way it
operates is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Coordinate systems which apply to the same physical domain
({\em{i.e.}}\ whose Frames have the same Domain value) can be directly
inter-compared.

If the domain has several coordinate systems associated with it
({\em{e.g.}}\ the celestial sphere), then a coordinate conversion may
be involved. Otherwise, coordinate values may simply be equated.

\item Coordinate systems which apply to different physical domains
({\em{i.e.}}\ whose Frames have different Domain values) cannot be
directly inter-compared.

If any relationship does exist between such coordinate systems---and
it need not---then additional information must be supplied in order to
establish the relationship between them in any particular case. We
will see later (\secref{ss:framesets}) how to establish such
relationships between Frames in different domains.
\end{itemize}

With the basic Frames we are considering here, each physical domain
only has a single coordinate system associated with it, so that if two
such Frames have the same Domain value, their coordinate systems will
be identical and may simply be equated. With more specialised Frames,
however, more than one coordinate system may apply to each domain. In
such cases, a coordinate conversion may need to be performed.

When a basic Frame is created, its Domain attribute defaults to an
empty string. This means that all such Frames belong to the same
(null) domain by default and therefore describe the same unspecified
physical coordinate space. In order to assign a Frame to a different
domain, you simply need to set its Domain value. This is normally most
conveniently done when it is created, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
frame1 = astFrame( 2, "Domain=CCD_CHIP,"
                      "Unit(1)=micron,"
                      "Unit(2)=micron" );
frame2 = astFrame( 2, "Domain=FOCAL_PLANE,"
                      "Unit(1)=mm,"
                      "Unit(2)=mm" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, we have created two Frames in different physical
domains. Although their coordinate values all have units of length,
they cannot be directly inter-compared (because their axes may be
rotated with respect to each other, for instance).

All Domain values are automatically converted to upper case and white
space is removed, but there are no other restrictions on the names you
may use to label different physical domains. From a practical point of
view, however, it is worth following a few conventions
(\secref{ss:domainconventions}).

\subsection{\label{ss:domainconventions}Conventions for Domain Names}

When choosing a value for the \htmlref{Domain}{Domain} attribute of a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}, it
obviously makes sense to avoid generic names which might clash with
those used for similar (but subtly different!) purposes by other
programmers. If you are developing software for an instrument, for
example, and want to identify an instrumental coordinate system, then
it is sensible to add a distinguishing prefix. For instance, you might
use $<$INST$>$\_FOCAL\_PLANE, where $<$INST$>$ ({\em{e.g.}}\ an
acronym) identifies your instrument.

For some purposes, however, a standard choice of Domain name is
desirable so that different items of software can communicate. For
this purpose, the following Domain names are reserved by AST and the
use recommended below should be carefully observed:

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item[GRAPHICS]\mbox{}\\
Identifies the coordinate space used by an underlying computer
graphics system to specify plotting operations. Typically, when
performing graphical operations, AST is used to define additional
coordinate systems which are related to these ``native'' graphical
coordinates.  Plotting may be carried out in any of these coordinate
systems, but the GRAPHICS domain identifies the native coordinates
through which AST communicates with the underlying graphics system.

\item[GRID]\mbox{}\\
Identifies the instantaneous {\em{data grid}} used to store and handle
data, together with an associated coordinate system. In this
coordinate system, the first element stored in an array of data always
has a coordinate value of unity at its centre and all elements have
unit extent. This applies to all dimensions.

If data are copied or transformed to a new data grid (by whatever
means), or a subset of the original grid is extracted, then the same
rules apply to the copy or subset. Its first element therefore has
GRID coordinate values of unity at its centre. Note that this means
that GRID coordinates remain attached to the first element of the data
grid and not to its data content ({\em{e.g.}}\ the features in an
image).

\item[PIXEL]\mbox{}\\
Identifies an array of pixels and an associated {\em{pixel-based}}
coordinate system which is related to the GRID coordinate system
(above) simply by a shift of origin along each axis. This shift may be
integral, fractional, positive, negative or zero. The data elements
retain their unit extent along each axis.

Because the amount of shift is unspecified, the PIXEL domain is
distinct from the GRID domain. The relationship between them contains
a degree of uncertainty, such as typically arises from the different
conventions used by different software systems. For instance, in some
software the first pixel is regarded as being centred at (1,1), while
in other software it is at (0.5,0.5). In addition, some software
packages implement a ``pixel origin'' which allows pixel coordinates
to start at an arbitrary value.

The GRID domain (which corresponds with the pixel-numbering convention
used by FITS) is a special case of the PIXEL domain and avoids this
uncertainty. In general, additional information is required in order
to convert from one to the other.

\item[SKY]\mbox{}\\
Identifies the domain which contains all equivalent celestial
coordinate systems. Because these are represented in AST by SkyFrames
(\secref{ss:skyframes}), it should be no surprise that the default
Domain value for a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} is SKY. Since there is only one sky, you
probably won't need to change this very often.
\end{description}
\end{quote}

Although we have drawn a necessary distinction here between the GRID
and PIXEL domains, we will continue to refer in general terms to image
``pixels'' and ``pixel coordinates'' whenever this distinction is not
important. This should not be taken to imply that the GRID convention
for numbering pixels is excluded---in fact, it is usually to be
preferred (at the level of data handling being discussed in this
document) and we recommend it.

\section{\label{ss:skyframes}Celestial Coordinate Systems (SkyFrames)}

A \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} which is specialised for representing coordinate systems on
the celestial sphere is obviously of great importance in
astronomy. The \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} is such a Frame. In this section we examine
the additional properties and behaviour of a SkyFrame that distinguish
it from a basic Frame (\secref{ss:frames}).

\subsection{The SkyFrame Model}

A \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} is, of course, a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} (\secref{ss:frames}) and also a
\htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} (\secref{ss:mappings}), so it inherits all the properties and
behaviour of these two ancestral classes.  When used as a Mapping, a
SkyFrame implements a unit transformation, exactly like a basic Frame
(\secref{ss:frameasmapping}) or a \htmlref{UnitMap}{UnitMap}, so this aspect of its
behaviour is not of great importance.

When used as a Frame, however, a SkyFrame represents a 2-dimensional
{\em{spherical}} coordinate system, in which the shortest distance
between two points is a great circle.  A SkyFrame therefore always has
exactly two axes which represent the longitude and latitude of a
coordinate system residing on the celestial sphere. Many such
coordinate systems can be represented by a SkyFrame, as we will see
shortly.

When it is first created, a SkyFrame's axes are always in the order
(longitude,~latitude) but this can be changed, if required, by using
the \htmlref{astPermAxes}{astPermAxes} function (\secref{ss:permutingaxes}). A SkyFrame's
coordinate values are always stored as angles in (double precision)
radians.

\subsection{Creating a SkyFrame}

The \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} constructor function is particularly simple and a
SkyFrame with default attributes is created as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
AstSkyFrame *skyframe;

...

skyframe = astSkyFrame( "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Such a SkyFrame would represent the default celestial coordinate
system which, at present, is the FK5~(J2000.0) equatorial system.

\subsection{Specifying a Particular Celestial Coordinate System}

For many purposes, the FK5~(J2000.0) coordinate system is perfectly
adequate. In order to support conversion between a variety of
celestial coordinate systems, however, you can create SkyFrames that
represent any of these.

Selection of a particular coordinate system is performed simply by
setting a value for the \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}'s (character string) \htmlref{System}{System}
attribute. This setting is most conveniently done when the SkyFrame is
created. For example, a SkyFrame representing the old FK4~(B1950.0)
coordinate system would be created by:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
skyframe = astSkyFrame( "System=FK4" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note that specifying ``System$=$FK4'' also changes the associated
equinox (from J2000.0 to B1950.0). This is because the default value
of the SkyFrame's \htmlref{Equinox}{Equinox} attribute (\secref{ss:equinoxitem}) depends
on the System attribute setting.

You may change the System value at any time, although this is not
usually needed.  The values supported are set out in the attribute's
description in \appref{ss:attributedescriptions} and include a variety
of equatorial coordinate systems, together with ecliptic and galactic
coordinates.

\subsection{Attributes which Qualify Celestial Coordinate Systems}

Many celestial coordinate systems have some additional free parameters
which serve to identify a particular coordinate system from amongst a
broader class of related coordinate systems. For example, the
FK5~(J2010.0) system is distinguished from the (default) FK5~(J2000.0)
system by a different equinox---and the coordinates of a fixed
astronomical source would have different values when expressed in
these two systems.

In AST, these free parameters are represented by additional \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}
attributes, each of which has a default appropriate to
({\em{i.e.}}\ defined by) the setting of the main \htmlref{System}{System}
attribute. Each of these {\em{qualifying attributes}} may, however, be
assigned an explicit value so as to select a particular coordinate
system.

The main SkyFrame attributes which qualify the System attribute are:

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item[\htmlref{Epoch}{Epoch}]\mbox{}\\
This value is used to qualify celestial coordinate systems by giving
the moment in time when the coordinates are correct for the
astronomical source under study. Usually, this will be the date of
observation.

The Epoch value is important in cases where the coordinates of a
source may change, or appear to change, with time due ({\em{e.g.}}) to
changing light deflection because of changes in the observer's
velocity, fictitious motion due to rotation of non-inertial coordinate
systems ({\em{e.g.}}\ the FK4 system), or proper motion of the source
itself (although this last effect is not supported by the SkyFrame
class).

\item[\label{ss:equinoxitem}\htmlref{Equinox}{Equinox}]\mbox{}\\
This value is used to qualify celestial coordinate systems that are
notionally based on the Earth's equator and/or the ecliptic (the plane
of the Earth's orbit around the Sun). The position of either of these
planes is difficult to specify precisely, so in practice a model
{\em{mean}}\ equator and/or ecliptic are used instead. These, together
with the point on the sky that defines the coordinate origin (termed
the {\em{mean equinox}}) move with time according to some model which
smooths out the more rapid fluctuations. The SkyFrame class supports
both the old FK4 model and the newer FK5 one.

Coordinates expressed in any of these systems vary with time due to
movement (by definition) of the coordinate system itself, and must
therefore be qualified by a moment in time (the {\em{epoch of the mean
equinox,}} or ``equinox'' for short) which specifies the position of
the model coordinate system on the sky. This is the role of the
Equinox attribute.

Note that it is quite valid and common to relate the position of a
source to an equinox other than the date of observation. Usually a
standard equinox such as J2000.0 is used, meaning that the coordinates
are referred to axes defined by where the model mean equator and
ecliptic would lie on the sky at the Julian epoch J2000.0.
\end{description}
\end{quote}

For further details of these attributes you should consult their
descriptions in \appref{ss:attributedescriptions} and for details of
the System settings for which they are relevant, see the description
of the System attribute (also in \appref{ss:attributedescriptions}).
For the interested reader, an excellent overview of celestial
coordinate systems can also be found in the documentation for the
SLALIB library (\xref{SUN/67}{sun67}{}).

The value of these qualifying attributes is most conveniently set at
the same time as the System value, {\em{e.g.}}\ when a SkyFrame is
created. For instance:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
skyframe = astSkyFrame( "System=Ecliptic, Equinox=J2005.5" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

would create a SkyFrame representing an ecliptic coordinate system
referred to the mean equinox and ecliptic of Julian epoch J2005.5.

Note that it does no harm to assign values to qualifying attributes
which are not relevant to the main System value. Any such values are
stored, but are not used unless the System value is later set so that
they become relevant.

\subsection{Using Default SkyFrame Attributes}

The default values supplied for many \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} attributes will depend
on the value of the SkyFrame's \htmlref{System}{System} attribute. In practice, this
means that there is usually little need to specify many of these
attributes explicitly unless you have some special requirement. This
can be illustrated by using \htmlref{astShow}{astShow} to examine a SkyFrame, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astShow( astSkyFrame( "System=FK4-NO-E, Epoch=1958" ) );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The output from this might look like the following:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
 Begin SkyFrame 	# Description of celestial coordinate system
#   Title = "FK4 Equatorial Coordinates, no E-terms, Mean Equinox B1950.0,
Epoch B1958.0" 	# Title of coordinate system
    Naxes = 2 	# Number of coordinate axes
#   Domain = "SKY" 	# Coordinate system domain
#   Lbl1 = "Right Ascension" 	# Label for axis 1
#   Lbl2 = "Declination" 	# Label for axis 2
#   Uni1 = "hh:mm:ss.s" 	# Units for axis 1
#   Uni2 = "ddd:mm:ss" 	# Units for axis 2
#   Dir1 = 0 	# Plot axis 1 in reverse direction
    Ax1 = 	# Axis number 1
       Begin SkyAxis 	# Celestial coordinate axis
       End SkyAxis
    Ax2 = 	# Axis number 2
       Begin SkyAxis 	# Celestial coordinate axis
       End SkyAxis
 IsA Frame 	# Coordinate system description
    System = "FK4-NO-E" 	# Celestial coordinate system type
    Epoch = 1958 	# Besselian epoch of observation
#   Eqnox = 1950 	# Besselian epoch of mean equinox
 End SkyFrame
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Note that the defaults (indicated by the ``\verb?#?'' comment
character at the start of the line) for attributes such as the \htmlref{Title}{Title},
axis Labels and Format specifiers are all set to values appropriate
for the particular equatorial coordinate system that the SkyFrame
represents.

This means, for example, that if we were to use this SkyFrame to
format a right ascension value stored in radians using \htmlref{astFormat}{astFormat}
(\secref{ss:formattingaxisvalues}), it would automatically result in a
string in sexagesimal notation (such as ``12:14:35.7'') suitable for
display.  If we changed the value of the SkyFrame's Digits attribute
(which is inherited from the \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} class), the number of digits
appearing would also change accordingly.

These choices would be appropriate for a System value of ``FK4-NO-E'',
but if a different System value were set, the defaults would be
correspondingly different. For example, ecliptic longitude is
traditionally expressed in degrees, so setting ``System=ecliptic''
would result in coordinate values being formatted as degrees by
default.

Of course, if you do not like any of these defaults, you may always
over-ride them by setting explicit attribute values yourself.

\subsection{\label{ss:formattingskyaxisvalues}Formatting Celestial Coordinates}

SkyFrames use \htmlref{astFormat}{astFormat} for formatting coordinate values in the same
way as other Frames (\secref{ss:formattingaxisvalues}). However, they
offer a different set of formatting options more appropriate to
celestial coordinates.

The Digits attribute of a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} behaves in essentially the same way
as for a basic \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} (\secref{ss:formattingwithdigits}), so the
precision with which celestial coordinates are displayed can also be
adjusted in this way. However, the range of format specifiers that can
be given for the \htmlref{Format(axis)}{Formataxis} attribute, and the default format
resulting from any particular Digits value, is different.

The syntax of SkyFrame format specifiers is detailed under the
description of the Format(axis) attribute in
\appref{ss:attributedescriptions}.  Briefly, however, it allows
celestial coordinates to be expressed either as angles or times and to
include one or more of the fields:

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item degrees or hours
\item arc-minutes or minutes
\item arc-seconds or seconds
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

with a specified number of decimal places for the final field. A range
of field separators is also available, as the following examples show:

\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
{\bf{Format Specifier}} & {\bf{Example Formatted Value}}\\
\hline \hline
{\tt{d}} & {\tt{219}}\\
{\tt{d.3}} & {\tt{219.123}}\\
{\tt{dm}} & {\tt{219:05}}\\
{\tt{dm.2}} & {\tt{219:05.44}}\\
{\tt{dms}} & {\tt{219:05:42}}\\
{\tt{hms.1}} & {\tt{15:44:13.8}}\\
{\tt{bdms.2}} & {\tt{219 05 42.81}}\\
{\tt{lhms.3}} & {\tt{15h44m13.88s}}\\
{\tt{+zlhms}} & {\tt{+06h10m44s}}\\
{\tt{ms.1}} & {\tt{13145:42.8}}\\
{\tt{lmst.3}} & {\tt{876m22.854s}}\\
{\tt{s.2}} & {\tt{788742.81}}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{quote}

Note the following key points:

\begin{itemize}
\item The required fields are specified using characters chosen from
either ``dms'' or ``hms'' according to whether the value is to be
formatted as an angle (in degrees) or a time (in hours).

\item If no degrees or hours field is required, the distinction
between angle and time may be made by including ``t'' to request time.

\item The number of decimal places (for the final field) is indicated
using ``{\tt{.}}'' followed by an integer.

\item ``b'' causes fields to be separated by blanks, while ``l''
causes them to be separated by the appropriate letters (the default
being a colon).

\item ``z'' causes padding with leading zeros.

\item ``+'' cause a plus sign to be prefixed to positive values
(negative values always have a minus sign).
\end{itemize}

The formatting performed by a SkyFrame is also influenced by the
\htmlref{AsTime(axis)}{AsTimeaxis} attribute, which has a boolean (integer) value for each
SkyFrame axis.  It determines whether the default format specifier for
an axis will present values as angles ({\em{e.g.}}\ in degrees) if it
is zero, or as times ({\em{e.g.}}\ in hours) if it is non-zero.

The default AsTime value depends on the celestial coordinate system
which the SkyFrame represents which, in turn, depends on its \htmlref{System}{System}
attribute value. For example, equatorial longitude values (right
ascension) are normally expressed in hours, whereas ecliptic
longitudes are normally expressed in degrees, so their default AsTime
values will reflect this difference.

The value of the AsTime attribute may be set explicitly to over-ride
these defaults if required, with the formatting precision being
determined by the \htmlref{Digits/Digits(axis)}{DigitsDigitsaxis} value. Alternatively, the
Format(axis) attribute may be set explicitly to specify both the
format and precision required. Setting an explicit Format value always
over-rides the effects of both the Digits and AsTime attributes.

\subsection{\label{ss:unformattingskyaxisvalues}Reading Formatted Celestial Coordinates}

The process of converting formatted celestial coordinates, such as
might be produced by the \htmlref{astFormat}{astFormat} function
(\secref{ss:formattingskyaxisvalues}), into numerical (double)
coordinate values is performed by using \htmlref{astUnformat}{astUnformat}
(\secref{ss:unformattingaxisvalues}) and passing it a pointer to a
\htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}. The use of a SkyFrame means that the range of input formats
accepted is appropriate to positions on the sky expressed as angles
and/or times, while the returned value is in radians.

The following describes the forms of celestial coordinate which are
supported:

\begin{itemize}
\item You may supply an optional sign, followed by between one and
three fields representing either degrees, arc-minutes, arc-seconds or
hours, minutes, seconds ({\em{e.g.}}\ ``$-$12~42~03'').

\item Each field should consist of a sequence of one or more digits,
which may include leading zeros. At most one field may contain a
decimal point, in which case it is taken to be the final field
({\em{e.g.}}\ decimal degrees might be given as ``124.707'', while
degrees and decimal arc-minutes might be given as ``$-$13~33.8'').

\item The first field given may take any value, allowing angles and
times outside the conventional ranges to be represented. However,
subsequent fields must have values of less than 60 ({\em{e.g.}}
``720~45~31'' is valid, whereas ``11~45~61'' is not).

\item Fields may be separated by white space or by ``:'' (colon), but
the choice of separator must be used consistently throughout the
value. Additional white space may be present around fields and
separators ({\em{e.g.}}\ ``$-$~2:~04~:~7.1'').

\item The following field identification characters may be used as
separators to replace those above (or may be appended to the final
field), in order to identify the field to which they are appended:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
d & -- & degrees \\
h & -- & hours \\
m & -- & minutes (of arc or time) \\
s & -- & seconds (of arc or time) \\
{\tt{'}} & -- & arc-minutes \\
{\tt{"}} & -- & arc-seconds
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

Either lower or upper case may be used.  Fields must be given in order
of decreasing significance
({\em{e.g.}}\ ``$-$11D~3{\tt{'}}~14.4{\tt{"}}'' or ``22h14m11.2s'').

\item The presence of certain field identification characters
indicates whether the value is to be interpreted as an angle or a time
(with 24 hours corresponding to 360 degrees), as follows:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
d & -- & angle \\
{\tt{'}} & -- & angle \\
{\tt{"}} & -- & angle \\
h & -- & time
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

Incompatible angle/time identification characters may not be mixed
({\em{e.g.}}\ ``10h14{\tt{'}}3{\tt{"}}'' is not valid).  The remaining
field identification characters and separators do not specify a
preference for an angle or a time and may be used with either.

\item If no preference for an angle or a time is expressed anywhere
within the value, then it is interpreted as an angle if the Format
attribute string associated with the SkyFrame axis generates an angle
and as a time otherwise.  This ensures that values produced by
astFormat (\secref{ss:formattingskyaxisvalues}) are correctly
interpreted by astUnformat.

\item Fields may be omitted, in which case they default to zero. The
remaining fields may be identified by using appropriate field
identification characters (see above) and/or by adding extra colon
separators (e.g. ``$-$05m13s'' is equivalent to ``$-$:05:13''). If a field
is not identified explicitly, it is assumed that adjacent fields have
been given, after taking account of any extra separator
characters. For example:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
10d & -- & degrees \\
10d12 & -- & degrees and arc-minutes \\
11:14{\tt{"}} & -- & arc-minutes and arc-seconds \\
9h13s & -- & hours and seconds of time \\
:45:33 & -- & minutes and seconds (of arc or time) \\
:55: & -- & minutes (of arc or time) \\
::13 & -- & seconds (of arc or time) \\
$-$6::2.5 & -- & degrees/hours and seconds (of arc or time) \\
07m14 & -- & minutes and seconds (of arc or time) \\
$-$8:14{\tt{'}} & -- & degrees and arc-minutes \\
$-$h3:14 & -- & minutes and seconds of time \\
h:2.1 & -- & seconds of time
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\item If fields are omitted in such a way that the remaining ones
cannot be identified uniquely (e.g. ``01:02''), then the first field
(either given explicitly or implied by an extra leading colon
separator) is taken to be the most significant field that astFormat
would produce when formatting a value (using the Format attribute
associated with the SkyFrame axis). By default, this means that the
first field will normally be interpreted as degrees or hours. However,
if this does not result in consistent field identification, then the
last field (either given explicitly or implied by an extra trailing
colon separator) is taken to to be the least significant field that
astFormat would produce.

\end{itemize}

This final convention is intended to ensure that values formatted by
astFormat which contain less than three fields will be correctly
interpreted if read back using astUnformat, even if they do not
contain field identification characters.  However, it also affects
other forms of input. For example, if the \htmlref{Format(axis)}{Formataxis} string were set
to ``mst.1'' (producing two fields representing minutes and seconds of
time), then formatted input would be interpreted by astUnformat as
follows:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
12 13 & -- & minutes and seconds \\
12 & -- & minutes \\
:13 & -- & seconds \\
$-$18: & -- & minutes \\
12.8 & -- & minutes \\
1 2 3 & -- & hours, minutes and seconds \\
& & \\
4{\tt{'}} & -- & arc-minutes \\
60::{\tt{"}} & -- & degrees \\
$-$23:{\tt{"}} & -- & arc-minutes \\
$-$33h & -- & hours
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

(in the last four cases, explicit field identification has been given
which overrides the implicit identification).

Alternatively, if the Format(axis) string were set to ``s.3''
(producing only an arc-seconds field), then formatted input would be
interpreted by astUnformat as follows:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
12.8 & -- & arc-seconds \\
12 13 & -- & arc-minutes and arc-seconds \\
:12 & -- & arc-seconds \\
13: & -- & arc-minutes \\
1 2 3 & -- & degrees, arc-minutes and arc-seconds
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

In general, if you are preparing formatted input data containing
celestial coordinates and wish to omit certain fields, then you are
advised to identify clearly those that you do provide by using the
appropriate field identification characters and/or extra colon
separators. This prevents you depending on the implicit field
identification described above which, in turn, depends on an
appropriate Format(axis) string having been set.

When writing software, it is also a good idea to set the Format(axis)
string so that data input will be as simple as possible for the
user. Unless some special effect is desired, this normally means that
it should contain ``d'' or ``h'' to ensure that the first field
entered by the user will be interpreted as degrees or hours, unless
otherwise identified. This is the normal behaviour unless an explicit
Format(axis) value has been set to override the default.

\section{\label{ss:introducingconversion}An Introduction to Coordinate System Conversions}

In this section, we start to look at techniques for converting between
different coordinate systems.  At this stage, the tools we have
available are Frames (\secref{ss:frames}), SkyFrames
(\secref{ss:skyframes}) and various Mappings
(\secref{ss:mappings}). These are sufficient to allow us to begin
examining the problem, but more sophisticated approaches will also
emerge later (\secref{ss:framesetconverting}).

\subsection{\label{ss:convertingskyframes}Converting between Celestial Coordinate Systems}

We begin by examining how to convert between two celestial coordinate
systems represented by SkyFrames, as this is both an illuminating and
practical example.  Consider the problem of converting celestial
coordinates between:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The old FK4 system, with no E terms, a Besselian epoch of
1958.0 and a Besselian equinox of 1960.0.

\item An ecliptic coordinate system based on the mean equinox and
ecliptic of Julian epoch 2010.5.
\end{enumerate}

This example is arbitrary but not completely unrealistic. Unless you
already have expertise with such conversions, you are unlikely to find
it straightforward.

Using AST, we begin by creating two SkyFrames to represent these
coordinate systems, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
AstSkyFrame *skyframe1, *skyframe2;

...

skyframe1 = astSkyFrame( "System=FK4-NO-E, Epoch=B1958, Equinox=B1960" );
skyframe2 = astSkyFrame( "System=Ecliptic, Equinox=J2010.5" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note how specifying the coordinate systems consists simply of
initialising the attributes of each \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} appropriately.  The next
step is to find a way of converting between these SkyFrames. This is
done using \htmlref{astConvert}{astConvert}, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFrameSet *cvt;

...

cvt = astConvert( skyframe1, skyframe2, "" );
if ( cvt == AST__NULL ) {
   <conversion is not possible>
} else {
   <conversion is possible>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The third argument of astConvert is not used here and should be an
empty string.

astConvert will return a null result, AST\_\_NULL (as defined in the
``ast.h'' header file), if conversion is not possible. In this
example, conversion is possible, so it will return a pointer to a new
\htmlref{Object}{Object} that describes the conversion.

The Object returned is called a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}. We have not discussed
FrameSets yet (\secref{ss:framesets}), but for the present purposes we
can consider them simply as Objects that can behave both as Mappings
and as Frames. It is the FrameSet's behaviour as a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} in which we
are mainly interested here, because the Mapping it implements is the
one we require---{\em{i.e.}}\ it converts between the two celestial
coordinate systems (\secref{ss:framesetsfromconvert}).

For example, if ``alpha1'' and ``delta1'' are two arrays containing
the longitude and latitude, in radians, of N points on the sky in the
original coordinate system (corresponding to ``skyframe1''), then they
could be converted into the new coordinate system (represented by
``skyframe2'') as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#define N 10
double alpha1[ N ], delta1[ N ];
double alpha2[ N ], delta2[ N ];

...

astTran2( cvt, N, alpha1, delta1, 1, alpha2, delta2 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The new coordinates are returned {\em{via}} the ``alpha2'' and
``delta2'' arrays.  To transform coordinates in the opposite
direction, we simply invert the 5th (boolean int) argument to
\htmlref{astTran2}{astTran2}, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astTran2( cvt, N, alpha2, delta2, 0, alpha1, delta1 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The FrameSet returned by astConvert also contains information about
the SkyFrames used in the conversion
(\secref{ss:framesetsfromconvert}). As we mentioned above, a FrameSet
may be used as a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} and in this case it behaves like the
``destination'' Frame used in the conversion ({\em{i.e.}}\ like
``skyframe2'').  We could therefore use the ``cvt'' FrameSet to
calculate the distance between two points (with coordinates in
radians) in the destination coordinate system, using \htmlref{astDistance}{astDistance}:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double distance, point1[ 2 ], point2[ 2 ];

...

distance = astDistance( cvt, point1, point2 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

and the result would be the same as if the ``skyframe2'' SkyFrame had
been used.

Another way to see how the FrameSet produced by astConvert retains
information about the coordinate systems involved is to set its \htmlref{Report}{Report}
attribute (inherited from the Mapping class) so that it displays the
coordinates before and after conversion (\secref{ss:transforming}):

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( cvt, "Report=1" );
astTran2( cvt, N, alpha1, delta1, 1, alpha2, delta2 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The output from this might look like the following:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
(2:06:03.0, 34:22:39) --> (42.1087, 20.2717)
(2:08:20.6, 35:31:24) --> (43.0197, 21.1705)
(2:10:38.1, 36:40:09) --> (43.9295, 22.0716)
(2:12:55.6, 37:48:55) --> (44.8382, 22.9753)
(2:15:13.1, 38:57:40) --> (45.7459, 23.8814)
(2:17:30.6, 40:06:25) --> (46.6528, 24.7901)
(2:19:48.1, 41:15:11) --> (47.5589, 25.7013)
(2:22:05.6, 42:23:56) --> (48.4644, 26.6149)
(2:24:23.1, 43:32:41) --> (49.3695, 27.5311)
(2:26:40.6, 44:41:27) --> (50.2742, 28.4499)
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Here, we see that the input FK4 equatorial coordinate values (given in
radians) have been formatted automatically in sexagesimal notation
using the conventional hours for right ascension and degrees for
declination. Conversely, the output ecliptic coordinates are shown in
decimal degrees, as is conventional for ecliptic coordinates. Both are
displayed using the default precision of 7 digits.\footnote{The
leading digit is zero and is therefore not seen in this particular
example.}

In fact, the ``cvt'' FrameSet has access to all the information in the
original SkyFrames which were passed to astConvert. If you had set a
new Digits attribute value for either of these, the formatting above
would reflect the different precision you requested by displaying a
greater or smaller number of digits.

\subsection{\label{ss:convertingpermutedaxes}Handling SkyFrame Axis Permutations}

We can illustrate an important point if we swap the axis order of
either \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} in the example above (\secref{ss:convertingskyframes})
before identifying the conversion. Let's assume we use \htmlref{astPermAxes}{astPermAxes}
(\secref{ss:permutingaxes}) to do this to the second SkyFrame, before
applying \htmlref{astConvert}{astConvert}, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int perm[ 2 ] = { 2, 1 };

...

astPermAxes( skyframe2, perm );
cvt = astConvert( skyframe1, skyframe2, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Now, the destination SkyFrame system no longer represents the
coordinate system:

\begin{quote}
(ecliptic~longitude, ecliptic~latitude)
\end{quote}

but instead represents the transposed system:

\begin{quote}
(ecliptic~latitude, ecliptic~longitude)
\end{quote}

As a consequence, when we use the \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} returned by astConvert to
apply a coordinate transformation, we obtain something like the
following:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
(2:06:03.0, 34:22:39) --> (20.2717, 42.1087)
(2:08:20.6, 35:31:24) --> (21.1705, 43.0197)
(2:10:38.1, 36:40:09) --> (22.0716, 43.9295)
(2:12:55.6, 37:48:55) --> (22.9753, 44.8382)
(2:15:13.1, 38:57:40) --> (23.8814, 45.7459)
(2:17:30.6, 40:06:25) --> (24.7901, 46.6528)
(2:19:48.1, 41:15:11) --> (25.7013, 47.5589)
(2:22:05.6, 42:23:56) --> (26.6149, 48.4644)
(2:24:23.1, 43:32:41) --> (27.5311, 49.3695)
(2:26:40.6, 44:41:27) --> (28.4499, 50.2742)
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

When compared to the original (\secref{ss:convertingskyframes}), the
output coordinate order has been swapped to compensate for the
different destination SkyFrame axis order.

In all, there are four possible axis combinations, corresponding to two
possible axis orders for each of the source and destination SkyFrames,
and astConvert will convert correctly between any of these.
The point to note is that a SkyFrame contains knowledge about how to
convert to and from other SkyFrames. Since its two axes (longitude and
latitude) are distinguishable, the conversion is able to take account
of the axis order.

\subsection{\label{ss:convertingframes}Converting Between Frames}

Having seen how clever SkyFrames are (\secref{ss:convertingskyframes}
and \secref{ss:convertingpermutedaxes}), we will next examine how dumb
a basic \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} can be in comparison. For example, if we create two
2-dimensional Frames and use \htmlref{astConvert}{astConvert} to derive a conversion between
them, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFrame *frame1, *frame2;

...

frame1 = astFrame( 2, "" );
frame2 = astFrame( 2, "" );
cvt = astConvert( frame1, frame2, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

then the coordinate transformation which the ``cvt'' \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} performs
will be as follows:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
(1, 2) --> (1, 2)
(2, 4) --> (2, 4)
(3, 6) --> (3, 6)
(4, 8) --> (4, 8)
(5, 10) --> (5, 10)
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This is an identity transformation, exactly the same as a \htmlref{UnitMap}{UnitMap}
(\secref{ss:unitmapexample}). Even if we permute the axis order of our
Frames, as we did above (\secref{ss:convertingpermutedaxes}), we will
fare no better. The conversion between our two basic Frames will
always be an identity transformation.

The reason for this is that, unlike a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}, all basic Frames start
life the same and have axes that are indistinguishable. Therefore,
permuting their axes doesn't make them look any different---they still
represent the same coordinate system.
%Actually, this behaviour isn't as dumb as it seems and can actually be
%very useful, as the following example illustrates.
%
%\subsection{Distinguishable and Indistinguishable Axes}
%
%c+
%Imagine you have two Frames which represent the pixel coordinates of
%two 2-dimensional images. Let's call their axes ``X'' and ``Y''.
%Suppose you now transpose the second image and swap its Frame axes
%(with \htmlref{astPermAxes}{astPermAxes}) to take account of this.
%c-
%f+
%Imagine you have two Frames which represent the pixel coordinates of
%two 2-dimensional images. Let's call their axes ``X'' and ``Y''.
%Suppose you now transpose the second image and swap its Frame axes
%(with astPermAxes) to take account of this.
%f-
%
%Next, consider what happens if you want to subtract one image from the
%other. If you have a ``subtract'' program that is intelligent and
%tries to align the two images for you, one of two things could happen:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%c+
%\item If the axes are distinguishable, when your program invokes
%astConvert it will derive a transformation between the two images
%which swaps the X and Y coordinates (corresponding to the transposition
%you applied to the second image). However, in aligning X-with-X and
%Y-with-Y, this will completely undo the effects of your transposition!
%c-
%f+
%\item If the axes are distinguishable, when your program invokes
%AST\_CONVERT it will derive a transformation between the two images
%which swaps the X and Y coordinates (corresponding to the transposition
%you applied to the second image). However, in aligning X-with-X and
%Y-with-Y, this will completely undo the effects of your transposition!
%f-
%
%\item If the axes are indistinguishable, the transformation between
%the two images will always be an identity
%(\secref{ss:convertingframes}). Therefore, your program will align
%X-with-Y and Y-with-X, so that you see the effects of your earlier
%transposition of the second image.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%Clearly, if we are considering pixel coordinates, the latter behaviour
%is preferable, since there would be no point in implementing an image
%transposition program if we could never see the effects of it. This
%indicates that a basic Frame, with is indistinguishable axes, is the
%correct type of \htmlref{Object}{Object} to represent a pixel coordinate system, where
%this behaviour is necessary.
%
%Conversely, the former behaviour would be more useful if the axes we
%were considering were, say, wavelength (in nm) and slit position (in
%mm). In this case, we would expect our ``subtract'' program to
%subtract data at corresponding wavelengths and slit positions, not
%just at corresponding pixels. This case requires distinguishable axes,
%so that corresponding axes in the two images can be matched up, just
%as happens with a SkyFrame (\secref{ss:convertingpermutedaxes}).
%
%Of course, there may also be intermediate cases, where some axes are
%distinguishable and others aren't.

\section{\label{ss:framesets}Coordinate System Networks (FrameSets)}

We saw in \secref{ss:introducingconversion} how \htmlref{astConvert}{astConvert} could be
used to find a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} that inter-relates a pair of coordinate systems
represented by Frames. There is a limitation to this, however, in that
it can only be applied to coordinate systems that are inter-related by
suitable conventions. In the case of celestial coordinates, the
relevant conventions are standards set out by the International
Astronomical Union, and others, that define what these coordinate
systems mean. In practice, however, the relationships between many
other coordinate systems are also of practical importance.

Consider, for example, the focal plane of a telescope upon which an
image of the sky is falling. We could measure positions in this focal
plane in millimetres or, if there were a detector system such as a CCD
present, we could count pixels. We could also use celestial
coordinates of many different kinds. All of these systems are
equivalent in their effectiveness at specifying positions in the focal
plane, but some are more convenient than others for particular
purposes.

Although we could, in principle, convert between all of these focal
plane coordinate systems, there is no pre-defined convention for doing
so. This is because the conversions required depend on where the
telescope is pointing and how the CCD is mounted in the focal
plane. Clearly, knowledge about this cannot be built into the AST
library and must be supplied in some other way. Note that this is
exactly the same problem as we met in \secref{ss:framedomains} when
discussing the \htmlref{Domain}{Domain} attribute---{\em{i.e.}}\ coordinate systems that
apply to different physical domains require that extra information be
supplied before we can convert between them.

What we need, therefore, is a general way to describe how coordinate
systems are inter-related, so that when there is no convention already
in place, we can define our own. We can then look forward to
converting, say, from pixels into galactic coordinates and {\em{vice
versa.}}  In AST, the \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} class provides this capability.

\subsection{The FrameSet Model}

Consider a coordinate system (call it number 1) which is represented
by a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} of some kind. Now consider a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which, when applied to
the coordinates in system 1 yields coordinates in another system,
number 2. The Mapping therefore inter-relates coordinate systems 1 and
2.

Now consider a second Mapping which inter-relates system 1 and a
further coordinate system, number 3. If we wanted to convert
coordinates between systems 2 and 3, we could do so by:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Applying our first Mapping in reverse, so as to convert between
systems 2 and 1.

\item Applying the second Mapping, as given, to convert between
systems 1 and 3.
\end{enumerate}

We are not limited to three coordinate systems, of course. In fact, we
could continue to introduce any number of further coordinate systems,
so long as we have a suitable Mapping for each one which relates it to
one of the Frames already present. Continuing in this way, we can
build up a network in which Frames are inter-related by Mappings in
such a way that there is always a way of converting between any pair
of coordinate systems.

The \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} (Figure~\ref{fig:frameset}) encapsulates these ideas.  It
is a network composed of Frames and associated Mappings, in which
there is always exactly one path, {\em{via}} Mappings, between any
pair of Frames.  Since we assemble FrameSets ourselves, they can be
used to represent any coordinate systems we choose and to set up the
particular relationships between them that we want.

\subsection{\label{ss:creatingaframeset}Creating a FrameSet}

Before we can create a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, we must have a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} of some kind to
put into it, so let's create a simple one:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
AstFrame *frame1;

...

frame1 = astFrame( 2, "Domain=A" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

We have set this Frame's \htmlref{Domain}{Domain} attribute (\secref{ss:framedomains}) to
A so that it will be distinct from the others we will be using. We can
now create a new FrameSet containing just this Frame, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFrameSet *frameset;

...

frameset = astFrameSet( frame1, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

So far, however, this Frame isn't related to any others.

\subsection{\label{ss:addingframes}Adding New Frames to a FrameSet}

We can now add further Frames to the \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} created above
(\secref{ss:creatingaframeset}). To do so, we must supply a new \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}
and an associated \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} that relates it to any of the Frames that
are already present (there is only one present so far).  To keep the
example simple, we will just use a \htmlref{ZoomMap}{ZoomMap} that multiplies coordinates
by 10. The required Objects are created as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFrame *frame2;
AstMapping *mapping12;

...

frame2 = astFrame( 2, "Domain=B" );
mapping12 = astZoomMap( 2, 10.0, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

To add the new Frame into our FrameSet, we use the \htmlref{astAddFrame}{astAddFrame}
function:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astAddFrame( frameset, 1, mapping12, frame2 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Whenever a Frame is added to a FrameSet, it is assigned an integer
index. This index starts with 1 for the initial Frame used to create
the FrameSet (\secref{ss:creatingaframeset}) and increments by one
every time a new Frame is added. This index is the primary way of
identifying the Frames within a FrameSet.

When a Frame is added, we also have to specify which of the existing
ones the new Frame is related to. Here, we chose number 1, the only
one present so far, and the new one we added became number 2.

Note that a FrameSet does not make copies of the Frames and Mappings
that you insert into it. Instead, it holds pointers to them. This
means that if you retain the original pointers to these Objects and
alter them, you will indirectly be altering the FrameSet's
contents. You can, of course, always use \htmlref{astCopy}{astCopy}
(\secref{ss:copyingobjects}) to make a separate copy of any \htmlref{Object}{Object} if
you need to ensure its independence.

We could also add a third Frame into our FrameSet, this time defining
a coordinate system which is reached by multiplying the original
coordinates (of ``frame1'') by 5:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astAddFrame( frameset, 1, astZoomMap( 2, 5.0, "" ), astFrame( 2, "Domain=C" ) );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, we have avoided storing unnecessary pointer values by using
function invocations directly as arguments for astAddFrame. This
assumes that we are using \htmlref{astBegin}{astBegin} and \htmlref{astEnd}{astEnd} (\secref{ss:contexts}) to
ensure that Objects are correctly deleted when no longer required.

\begin{latexonly}
   Our example FrameSet now contains three Frames and two Mappings with
   the arrangement shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fsexample}.

   its current Frame) is shown in bold.}

   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}


\subsection{\label{ss:baseandcurrent}The Base and Current Frames}

At all times, one of the Frames in a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} is designated to be its
{\em{base}} \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} and one to be its {\em{current}} Frame
(Figure~\ref{fig:fsexample}). These Frames are identified by two
integer FrameSet attributes, \htmlref{Base}{Base} and \htmlref{Current}{Current}, which hold the indices
of the nominated Frames within the FrameSet.

The existence of the base and current Frames reflects an important
application of FrameSets, which is to attach coordinate systems to
entities such as data arrays, data files, plotting surfaces (for
graphics), {\em{etc.}}  In this context, the base Frame represents the
``native'' coordinate system of the attached entity---for example, the
pixel coordinates of an image or the intrinsic coordinates of a
plotting surface. The other Frames within the FrameSet represent
alternative coordinate systems which may also be used to refer to
positions within that entity.  The current Frame represents the
particular coordinate system which is currently selected for use. For
instance, if an image were being displayed, you would aim to label it
with coordinates corresponding to the current Frame. In order to see a
different coordinate system, a software user would arrange for a
different Frame to be made current.

The choice of base and current Frames may be changed at any time,
simply by assigning new values to the FrameSet's Base and Current
attributes. For example, to make the Frame with index 3 become the
current Frame, you could use:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSetI( frameset, "Current", 3 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

You can nominate the same Frame to be both the base and current Frame
if you wish.
\label{ss:baseandcurrentdefault}

By default ({\em{i.e.}}\ if the Base or Current attribute is un-set),
the first Frame added to a FrameSet becomes its base Frame and the
last one added becomes its current Frame.\footnote{Although this is
reversed if the FrameSet's \htmlref{Invert}{Invert} attribute is non-zero.} Whenever a
new Frame is added to a FrameSet, the Current attribute is modified so
that the new Frame becomes the current one. This behaviour is
reflected in the state of the example FrameSet in
Figure~\ref{fig:fsexample}.

\subsection{\label{ss:astbaseandastcurrent}Referring to the Base and Current Frames}

It is often necessary to refer to the base and current Frames
(\secref{ss:baseandcurrent}) within a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, but it can be
cumbersome having to obtain their indices from the \htmlref{Base}{Base} and \htmlref{Current}{Current}
attributes on each occasion. To make this easier, two macros,
AST\_\_BASE and AST\_\_CURRENT, are defined in the ``ast.h'' header
file and may be used to represent the indices of the base and current
Frames respectively. They may be used whenever a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} index is
required.

For example, when adding a new Frame to a FrameSet
(\secref{ss:addingframes}), you could use the following to indicate
that the new Frame is related to the existing current Frame, whatever
its index happens to be:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFrame *frame;
AstMapping *mapping;

...

astAddFrame( frameset, AST__CURRENT, mapping, frame );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Of course, the Frame you added would then become the new current
Frame.

\subsection{\label{ss:framesetasmapping}Using a FrameSet as a Mapping}

The \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} class inherits properties and behaviour from the \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}
class (\secref{ss:frames}) and, in turn, from the \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} class
(\secref{ss:mappings}). Its behaviour when used as a Mapping is
particularly important.

Consider, for instance, passing a FrameSet pointer to a coordinate
transformation function such as \htmlref{astTran2}{astTran2}:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#define N 10
double xin[ N ], yin[ N ], xout[ N ], yout[ N ];

...

astTran2( frameset, N, xin, yin, 1, xout, yout );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The coordinate transformation applied by this FrameSet would be the
one which converts between its base and current Frames. Using the
FrameSet in Figure~\ref{fig:fsexample}, for example, the coordinates
would be multiplied by a factor of 5.  If we instead requested the
FrameSet's inverse transformation, we would be transforming from its
current Frame to its base Frame, so our example FrameSet would then
multiply by a factor of 0.2.

Whenever the choice of base and current Frames changes, the
transformations which a FrameSet performs when used as a Mapping also
change to reflect this. The \htmlref{Nin}{Nin} and \htmlref{Nout}{Nout} attributes may also change in
consequence, because they are determined by the numbers of axes in the
FrameSet's base and current Frames respectively. These numbers need
not necessarily be equal, of course.

Like any Mapping, a FrameSet may also be inverted by changing the
boolean sense of its \htmlref{Invert}{Invert} attribute, {\em{e.g.}}\ using \htmlref{astInvert}{astInvert}
(\secref{ss:invertingmappings}). If this is happens, the values of the
FrameSet's \htmlref{Base}{Base} and \htmlref{Current}{Current} attributes are interchanged, along with
its Nin and Nout attributes, so that its base and current Frames swap
places. When used as a Mapping, the FrameSet will therefore perform
the inverse transformation to that which it performed previously.

To summarise, a FrameSet may be used exactly like any other Mapping
which inter-relates the coordinate systems described by its base and
current Frames.

\subsection{\label{ss:extractingamapping}Extracting a Mapping from a FrameSet}

Although it is very convenient to use a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} when a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} is
required (\secref{ss:framesetasmapping}), a FrameSet necessarily
contains additional information and sometimes this might cause
inefficiency or confusion.  For example, if you wanted to use a
Mapping contained in one FrameSet and insert it into another, it would
probably not be efficient to insert the whole of the first FrameSet
into the second one, although it would work.

In such a situation, the \htmlref{astGetMapping}{astGetMapping} function allows you to extract
a Mapping from a FrameSet. You do this by specifying the two Frames
which the Mapping should inter-relate using their indices within the
FrameSet. For example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
map = astGetMapping( frameset, 2, 3 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

would return a pointer to a Mapping that converted between Frames~2
and 3 in the FrameSet. Its inverse transformation would then convert
in the opposite direction, {\em{i.e.}}\ between Frames~3 and 2.  Note
that this Mapping might not be independent of the Mappings contained
within the FrameSet---{\em{i.e.}}\ they may share sub-Objects---so
\htmlref{astCopy}{astCopy} should be used to make a copy if you need to guarantee
independence (\secref{ss:copyingobjects}).

Very often, the Mapping returned by astGetMapping will be a compound
Mapping, or \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap} (\secref{ss:cmpmaps}). This reflects the fact that
conversion between the two Frames may need to be done {\em{via}} an
intermediate coordinate system so that several stages may be involved.
You can, however, easily simplify this Mapping (where this is possible)
by using the \htmlref{astSimplify}{astSimplify} function (\secref{ss:simplifyingcmpmaps}) and
this is recommended if you plan to use it for transforming a large
amount of data.

\subsection{\label{ss:framesetasframe}Using a FrameSet as a Frame}

A \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} can also be used as a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}, in which capacity it almost
always behaves as if its current Frame had been used instead. For
example, if you request the \htmlref{Title}{Title} attribute of a FrameSet using:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
const char *title;

...

title = astGetC( frameset, "Title" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

the result will be the Title of the current Frame, or a suitable
default if the current Frame's Title attribute is un-set. The same
also applies to other attribute operations---{\em{i.e.}}\ setting,
clearing and testing attributes.  Most attributes shared by both
Frames and FrameSets behave in this way, such as \htmlref{Naxes}{Naxes}, \htmlref{Label(axis)}{Labelaxis},
\htmlref{Format(axis)}{Formataxis}, {\em{etc.}} There are, however, a few exceptions:

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item[\htmlref{Class}{Class}]\mbox{}\\
Has the value ``FrameSet''.

\item[\htmlref{ID}{ID}]\mbox{}\\
Identifies the particular FrameSet (not its current Frame).

\item[\htmlref{Nin}{Nin}]\mbox{}\\
Equals the number of axes in the FrameSet's base Frame.

\item[\htmlref{Invert}{Invert}]\mbox{}\\
Is independent of any of the Objects within the FrameSet.

\item[\htmlref{Nobject}{Nobject}]\mbox{}\\
Counts the number of active FrameSets.

\item[\htmlref{RefCount}{RefCount}]\mbox{}\\
Counts the number of active pointers to the FrameSet (not to its
current Frame).
\end{description}
\end{quote}

Note that the set of attributes possessed by a FrameSet can vary,
depending on the nature of its current Frame. For example, if the
current Frame is a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} (\secref{ss:skyframes}), then the FrameSet
will acquire an \htmlref{Equinox}{Equinox} attribute from it which can be set, enquired,
{\em{etc.}}  However, if the current Frame is changed to be a basic
Frame, which does not have an Equinox attribute, then this attribute
will be absent from the FrameSet as well. Any attempt to reference it
will then result in an error.

\subsection{Extracting a Frame from a FrameSet}

Although a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} may be used in place of its current \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} in most
situations, it is sometimes convenient to have direct access to a
specified Frame within it. This may be obtained using the \htmlref{astGetFrame}{astGetFrame}
function, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
frame = astGetFrame( frameset, AST__BASE );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This would return a pointer (not a copy) to the base Frame within the
FrameSet. Note the use of AST\_\_BASE
(\secref{ss:astbaseandastcurrent}) as shorthand for the value of the
FrameSet's \htmlref{Base}{Base} attribute, which gives the base Frame's index.

\subsection{Removing a Frame from a FrameSet}

Removing a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} from a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} is straightforward and is performed
using the \htmlref{astRemoveFrame}{astRemoveFrame} function. You identify the Frame you wish to
remove in the usual way, by giving its index within the FrameSet. For
example, the following would remove the Frame with index 1:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astRemoveFrame( frameset, 1 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The only restriction is that you cannot remove the last remaining
Frame because a FrameSet must always contain at least one Frame.  When
a Frame is removed, the Frames which follow it are re-numbered
({\em{i.e.}}\ their indices are reduced by one) so as to preserve the
sequence of consecutive Frame indices.  The FrameSet's \htmlref{Nframe}{Nframe}
attribute is also decremented.

If appropriate, astRemoveFrame will modify the FrameSet's \htmlref{Base}{Base} and/or
\htmlref{Current}{Current} attributes so that they continue to identify the same Frames
as previously. If either the base or current Frame is removed,
however, the corresponding attribute will become un-set, so that it
reverts to its default value (\secref{ss:baseandcurrentdefault}) and
therefore identifies an alternative Frame.

Note that it is quite permissible to remove any Frame from a FrameSet,
even although other Frames may appear to depend on it. For example, in
Figure~\ref{fig:fsexample}, if Frame~1 were removed, the correct
relationship between Frames~2 and 3 would still be preserved, although
they would be re-numbered as Frames~1 and 2.

\section{\label{ss:fshigher}Higher Level Operations on FrameSets}

\subsection{\label{ss:framesetsfromconvert}Creating FrameSets with astConvert}

Before considering the important subject of using FrameSets to convert
between coordinate systems (\secref{ss:framesetconverting}), let us
return briefly to reconsider the output generated by \htmlref{astConvert}{astConvert}. We
used this function earlier (\secref{ss:introducingconversion}), when
converting between the coordinate systems represented by various kinds
of \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}, and indicated that it returns a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} to represent the
coordinate conversion it identifies. We are now in a position to
examine the structure of this FrameSet.

Take our earlier example (\secref{ss:convertingskyframes}) of
converting between the celestial coordinate systems represented by two
SkyFrames:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
AstFrameSet *cvt;
AstSkyFrame *skyframe1, *skyframe2;

...

skyframe1 = astSkyFrame( "System=FK4-NO-E, Epoch=B1958, Equinox=B1960" );
skyframe2 = astSkyFrame( "System=Ecliptic, Equinox=J2010.5" );

cvt = astConvert( skyframe1, skyframe2, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

\begin{latexonly}
   This will produce a pointer, ``cvt'', to the FrameSet shown in
   Figure~\ref{fig:fsconvert}.
   \begin{figure}[bhtp]
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{sun211_figures/fsconvert.eps}
   \caption{The FrameSet produced when astConvert is used to convert
   between the coordinate systems represented by two SkyFrames. The
   source \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} becomes the base Frame, while the destination SkyFrame
   becomes the current Frame. The \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} between them implements the
   required conversion.}
   \label{fig:fsconvert}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   This will produce a pointer, ``cvt'', to the FrameSet shown in the
   Figure below.
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}[bhtp]

   \caption{The FrameSet produced when astConvert is used to convert

   source SkyFrame becomes the base Frame, while the destination SkyFrame
   becomes the current Frame. The Mapping between them implements the
   required conversion.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}
As can be seen, this FrameSet contains just two Frames.  The source
Frame supplied to astConvert becomes its base Frame, while the
destination Frame becomes its current Frame. (The FrameSet, of course,
simply holds pointers to these Frames, rather than making copies.) The
Mapping which relates the base Frame to the current Frame is the one
which implements the required conversion.

As we noted earlier (\secref{ss:convertingskyframes}), the FrameSet
returned by astConvert may be used both as a Mapping and as a Frame to
perform most of the functions you are likely to need. However, the
Mapping may be extracted for use on its own if necessary, using
\htmlref{astGetMapping}{astGetMapping} (\secref{ss:extractingamapping}), for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstMapping *mapping;

...

mapping = astGetMapping( cvt, AST__BASE, AST__CURRENT );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

\subsection{\label{ss:framesetconverting}Converting between FrameSet Coordinate Systems}

\begin{latexonly}
   We now consider the process of converting between the coordinate
   systems represented by two FrameSets. This is a most important
   operation, as a subsequent example (\secref{ss:registeringimages})
   will show, and is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fsalign}.
   \begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{sun211_figures/fsalign.eps}

   practice, there may be many ways of pairing Frames to find the
   ``missing link'', so the Frames' \htmlref{Domain}{Domain} attribute may be used to
   narrow the choice.}

   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}
Recalling (\secref{ss:framesetasframe}) that a FrameSet will behave
like its current \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} when necessary, conversion between two
FrameSets is performed using \htmlref{astConvert}{astConvert}
(\secref{ss:convertingskyframes}), but supplying pointers to FrameSets
instead of Frames. The effect of this is to convert between the
coordinate systems represented by the current Frames of each FrameSet:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFrameSet *frameseta, *framesetb;

...

cvt = astConvert( frameseta, framesetb, "SKY" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

When using FrameSets, we are presented with considerably more
conversion options than when using Frames alone. This is because each
current Frame is related to all the other Frames in its respective
FrameSet. Therefore, if we can establish a link between any pair of
Frames, one from each FrameSet, we can form a complete conversion path
between the two current Frames (Figure~\ref{fig:fsalign}).

This expanded range of options is, of course, precisely the
intention. By connecting Frames together within a FrameSet, we have
extended the range of coordinate systems that can be reached from any
one of them.  We are therefore no longer restricted to converting
between Frames with the same Domain value (\secref{ss:framedomains}),
but can go {\em{via}} a range of intermediate coordinate systems in
order to make the connection we require. Transformation between
different domains has therefore become possible because, in assembling
the FrameSets, we provided the additional information needed to
inter-relate them.

It is important to appreciate, however, that the choice of ``missing
link'' is crucial in determining the conversion that results.
Although each FrameSet may be perfectly self-consistent internally,
this does not mean that all conversion paths through the combined
network of Mappings are equivalent. Quite the contrary in fact:
everything depends on where the inter-connecting link between the two
FrameSets is made.  In practice, there may be a large number of
possible pairings of Frames and hence of possible links. Other factors
must therefore be used to restrict the choice. These are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Not every possible pairing of Frames is legitimate. For example,
you cannot convert directly between a basic Frame and a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} which
belong to different classes, so such pairings will be ignored.

\item In a similar way, you cannot convert directly between Frames
with different Domain values (\secref{ss:framedomains}). If the Domain
attribute is used consistently (typically only one Frame in each
FrameSet will have a particular Domain value), then this further
restricts the choice.

\item The third argument of astConvert may then be used to specify
explicitly which Domain value the paired Frames should have. You may
also supply a comma-separated list of preferences here (see below).

\item If the above steps fail to uniquely identify the link, then the
first suitable pairing of Frames is used, so that any ambiguity is
resolved by the order in which Frames are considered for pairing (see
the description of the astConvert function in
\appref{ss:functiondescriptions} for details of the search
order).\footnote{If you find that how this ambiguity is resolved
actually makes a difference to the conversion that results, then you
have probably constructed a FrameSet which lacks internal
self-consistency. For example, you might have two Frames representing
indistinguishable coordinate systems but inter-related by a non-null
\htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}.}
\end{enumerate}

In the example above we supplied the string ``SKY'' as the third
argument of astConvert. This constitutes a request that a pair of
Frames with
the Domain value SKY ({\em{i.e.}}\ representing celestial coordinate
systems) should be used to inter-relate the two FrameSets. Note that
this does not specify which celestial coordinate system to use, but is
a general request that the two FrameSets be inter-related using
coordinates on the celestial sphere.

Of course, it may be that this request cannot be met because there may
not be a celestial coordinate system in both FrameSets. If this is
likely to happen, we can supply a list of preferences, or a
{\em{domain search path,}}
as the third argument to astConvert, such as
the following:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
cvt = astConvert( frameseta, framesetb, "SKY,PIXEL,GRID," );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Now, if the two FrameSets cannot be inter-related using the SKY domain,
astConvert will attempt to use the PIXEL domain instead. If this
also fails, it will try the GRID domain. A blank field in the domain
search path (here indicated by the final comma) allows any Domain
value to be used. This can be employed as a last resort when all else
has failed.

If astConvert succeeds in identifying a conversion, it will return a
pointer to a FrameSet (\secref{ss:framesetsfromconvert}) in which the
source and destination Frames are inter-connected by the required
Mapping. In this case, of course, these Frames will be the current
Frames of the two FrameSets, but in all other respects the returned
FrameSet is the same as when converting between Frames.

Very importantly, however, astConvert may modify the FrameSets you are
converting between. It does this, in order to indicate which pairing
of Frames was used to inter-relate them, by changing the \htmlref{Base}{Base}
attribute for each FrameSet so that the Frame used in the pairing
becomes its base Frame (\secref{ss:baseandcurrent}).

Finally, note that astConvert may also be used to convert between a
FrameSet and a Frame, or {\em{vice versa.}} If a pointer to a Frame is
supplied for either the first or second argument, it will behave like
a FrameSet containing only a single Frame.

\subsection{\label{ss:registeringimages}Example---Registering Two Images}

Consider two images which have been calibrated by attaching FrameSets
to them, such that the base \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} of each \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} corresponds to the
raw data grid coordinates of each image (the GRID domain of
\secref{ss:domainconventions}). Suppose, also, that these FrameSets
contain an unknown number of other Frames, representing alternative
world coordinate systems.  What we wish to do is register these two
images, such that we can transform from a position in the data grid of
one into the corresponding position in the data grid of the other.
This is a very practical example because images will typically be
calibrated using FrameSets in precisely this way.

The first step will probably involve making a copy of both FrameSets
(using \htmlref{astCopy}{astCopy}---\secref{ss:copyingobjects}), since we will be
modifying them. Let ``frameseta'' and ``framesetb'' be pointers to
these copies. Since we want to convert between the base Frames of
these FrameSets ({\em{i.e.}}\ their data grid coordinates), the next
step is to make these Frames current. This is simply done by inverting
both FrameSets, which interchanges their base and current
Frames. \htmlref{astInvert}{astInvert} will perform this task:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astInvert( frameseta );
astInvert( framesetb );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

To identify the required conversion, we now use \htmlref{astConvert}{astConvert}, supplying
a suitable domain search path with which we would like our two images
to be registered:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
cvt = astConvert( frameseta, framesetb, "SKY,PIXEL,GRID" );
if ( cvt == AST__NULL ) {
   <no conversion was possible>
} else {
   <conversion was possible>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The effects of this are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item astConvert first attempts to register the two images on the
celestial sphere ({\em{i.e.}}\ using the SKY domain). To do this, it
searches for a celestial coordinate system, although not necessarily
the same one, attached to each image.  If it finds a suitable pair of
coordinate systems, it then registers the images by matching
corresponding positions on the sky.

\item If this fails, astConvert next tries to match positions in the
PIXEL domain (\secref{ss:framedomains}). If it succeeds, the two
images will then be registered so that their corresponding pixel
positions correspond. If the PIXEL domain is offset from the data grid
(as typically happens in data reduction systems which implement a
``pixel origin''), then this will be correctly accounted for.

\item If this also fails, the GRID domain is finally used. This will
result in image registration by matching corresponding points in the
data grids used by both images. This means they will be
aligned so that the first element their data arrays correspond.

\item If all of the above fail, astConvert will return the value
AST\_\_NULL. Otherwise a pointer to a FrameSet will be returned.
\end{enumerate}

The resulting ``cvt'' FrameSet may then be used directly
(\secref{ss:convertingskyframes}) to convert between positions in the
data grid of the first image and corresponding positions in the data
grid of the second image.

To determine which domain was used to achieve registration,
we can use the fact that the \htmlref{Base}{Base} attribute of each FrameSet is set by
astConvert to indicate which intermediate Frames were used. We
can therefore simply invert either FrameSet (to make its base Frame
become the current one) and then enquire the \htmlref{Domain}{Domain} value:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
const char *domain;

...

astInvert( frameseta );
domain = astGetC( frameseta, "Domain" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

If conversion was successful, the result will be one of the strings
``SKY'', ``PIXEL'' or ``GRID''.

\subsection{\label{ss:remapframe}Re-Defining a FrameSet Coordinate System}

As discussed earlier (\secref{ss:baseandcurrent}), an important
application of a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} is to allow coordinate system information to
be attached to entities such as images in order to calibrate them. In
addition, one of the main objectives of AST is to simplify the
propagation of such information through successive stages of data
processing, so that it remains consistent with the associated image
data.

In such a situation, the FrameSet's base \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} would correspond with
the image's data grid coordinates and its other Frames (if any) with
the various alternative world coordinate systems associated with the
image.  If the data processing being performed does not change the
relationship between the image's data grid coordinates and any of the
associated world coordinate systems, then propagation of the WCS
information is straightforward and simply involves copying the
FrameSet associated with the image.

If any of these relationships change, however, then corresponding
changes must be made to the way Frames within the FrameSet are
inter-related. By far the most common case occurs when the image
undergoes some geometrical transformation resulting in ``re-gridding''
on to another data grid, but the same principles can be applied to any
re-definition of a coordinate system.

To pursue the re-gridding example, we would need to modify our
FrameSet to account for the fact that the image's data grid coordinate
system (corresponding to the FrameSet's base Frame) has
changed. Looking at the steps needed in detail, we might proceed as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which represents the relationship between the
original data grid coordinate system and the new one.

\item Obtain a Frame to represent the new data grid coordinate system
(we could re-use the original base Frame here, using \htmlref{astGetFrame}{astGetFrame} to
obtain a pointer to it).

\item Add the new Frame to the FrameSet, related to the original base
Frame by the new Mapping. This Frame now represents the new data grid
coordinate system and is correctly related to all the other Frames
present.\footnote{This is because any transformation to or from this
new Frame must go {\em{via}} the base Frame representing the original
data grid coordinate system, which we assume was correctly related to
all the other Frames present.}

\item Remove the original base Frame (representing the old data grid
coordinate system).

\item Make the new Frame the base Frame and restore the original
current Frame.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{latexonly}
   The effect of these steps is to change the relationship between the
   base Frame and all the other Frames present. It is as if a new Mapping
   has been interposed between the Frame we want to alter and all the
   other Frames within the FrameSet (Figure~\ref{fig:fsremap}).
   \begin{figure}[hbtp]
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{sun211_figures/fsremap.eps}
   \caption{The effect of \htmlref{astRemapFrame}{astRemapFrame} is to interpose a Mapping between
   a nominated Frame within a FrameSet and the remaining contents of the
   FrameSet. This effectively ``re-defines'' the coordinate system
   represented by the affected Frame. It may be used to compensate (say)
   for geometrical changes made to an associated image. The
   inter-relationships between all the other Frames within the FrameSet
   remain unchanged.}
   \label{fig:fsremap}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   The effect of these steps is to change the relationship between the
   base Frame and all the other Frames present. It is as if a new Mapping
   has been interposed between the Frame we want to alter and all the
   other Frames within the FrameSet (see Figure below).
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}[hbtp]
   \label{fig:fsremap}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{sun211_figures/fsremap.eps}
   \caption{The effect of astRemapFrame is to interpose a Mapping between

   inter-relationships between all the other Frames within the FrameSet
   remain unchanged.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}

Performing the steps above is rather lengthy, however, so the
astRemapFrame function is provided to perform all of these operations
in one go. A practical example of its use is given below
(\secref{ss:wcsprocessingexample}).

\subsection{\label{ss:wcsprocessingexample}Example---Binning an Image}

As an example of using \htmlref{astRemapFrame}{astRemapFrame}, consider a case where the pixels
of a 2-dimensional image have been binned 2$\times$2, so as to reduce
the image size by a factor of two in each dimension.  We must now
modify the associated \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} to reflect this change to the
image. Much the same process would be needed for any other geometrical
change the image might undergo.

We first set up a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} (a \htmlref{WinMap}{WinMap} in this case) which relates the
data grid coordinates in the original image to those in the new one:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstWinMap *winmap;
double ina[ 2 ] = { 0.5, 0.5 };
double inb[ 2 ] = { 2.5, 2.5 };
double outa[ 2 ] = { 0.5, 0.5 };
double outb[ 2 ] = { 1.5, 1.5 };

...

winmap = astWinMap( 2, ina, inb, outa, outb, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, we have simply set up arrays containing the data grid
coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the first
element in the output image (``outa'' and ``outb'') and the
corresponding coordinates in the input image (``ina'' and
``inb''). \htmlref{astWinMap}{astWinMap} then creates a WinMap which performs the required
transformation. We do not need to know the size of the image.

We can then pass this WinMap to astRemapFrame. This modifies the
relationship between our FrameSet's base \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} and the other Frames in
the FrameSet, so that the base Frame represents the data grid
coordinate system of the new image rather than the old one:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstFrameSet *frameset;

...

astRemapFrame( frameset, AST__BASE, winmap );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Any other coordinate systems described by the FrameSet, no matter how
many of these there might be, are now correctly associated with the
new image.

\subsection{\label{ss:framesetintegrity}Maintaining the Integrity of FrameSets}

When constructing a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, you are provided with a framework into
which you can place any combination of Frames and Mappings that you
wish. There are relatively few constraints on this process and no
checks are performed to see whether the FrameSet you construct makes
physical sense.  It is quite possible, for example, to construct a
FrameSet containing two identical SkyFrames which are inter-related by
a non-unit \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}. AST will not object if you do this, but it makes
no sense, because applying a non-unit Mapping to any set of celestial
coordinates cannot yield positions that are still in the original
coordinate system.  If you use such a FrameSet to perform coordinate
conversions, you are likely to get unpredictable results because the
information in the FrameSet is corrupt.

It is, of course, your responsibilty as a programmer to ensure the
validity of any information which you insert into a
FrameSet. Normally, this is straightforward and simply consists of
formulating your problem correctly (a diagram can often help to
clarify how coordinate systems are inter-related) and writing the
appropriate bug-free code to construct the FrameSet. However, once you
start to modify an existing FrameSet, there are new opportunities for
corrupting it!

Consider, for example, a FrameSet whose current \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} is a
\htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}. We can set a new value for this SkyFrame's \htmlref{Equinox}{Equinox} attribute
simply by using \htmlref{astSet}{astSet} on the FrameSet, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( frameset, "Equinox=J2010" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The effect of this will be to change the celestial coordinate system
which the current Frame represents. You can see, however, that this
has the potential to make the FrameSet corrupt unless corresponding
changes are also made to the Mapping which relates this SkyFrame to
the other Frames within the FrameSet. In fact, it is a general rule
that any change to a FrameSet which affects its current Frame can
potentially require corresponding changes to the FrameSet's Mappings
in order to maintain its overall integrity.

Fortunately, once you have stored valid information in a FrameSet, AST
will look after these details for you automatically, so that the
FrameSet's integrity is maintained. In the example above, it would do
this by appropriately re-mapping the current Frame (as if
\htmlref{astRemapFrame}{astRemapFrame} had been used---\secref{ss:remapframe}) in response to
the use of astSet. One way of illustrating this process is as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstSkyFrame *skyframe;

...

skyframe = astSkyFrame( "" );
frameSet = astFrameSet( skyframe );
astAddFrame( frameset, 1, astUnitMap( 2, "" ), skyframe );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This constructs a trivial FrameSet whose base and current Frames are
both the same SkyFrame connected by a \htmlref{UnitMap}{UnitMap}. You can think of this
as a ``pipe'' connecting two coordinate systems. At present, these two
systems represent identical FK5 (J2000) coordinates, so the FrameSet
implements a unit Mapping. We can change the coordinate system on the
current end of this pipe as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( frameset, "System=Ecliptic, Equinox=J2010" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

and the Mapping which the FrameSet implements would change
accordingly. To change the coordinate system on the base end of the
pipe, we might use:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astInvert( frameset );
astSet( frameset, "System=Galactic" );
astInvert( frameset );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The FrameSet would then convert between galactic and ecliptic
coordinates.

Note that astSet is not the only function which has this effect:
\htmlref{astClear}{astClear} behaves similarly, as also does \htmlref{astPermAxes}{astPermAxes}
(\secref{ss:permutingaxes}). If you need to circumvent this mechanism
for any reason, this can be done by going behind the scenes and
obtaining a pointer directly to the Frame you wish to modify. Consider
the following, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
skyframe = astGetFrame( frameset, AST__CURRENT );
astSet( skyframe, "Equinox=J2010" );
skyframe = astAnnul( skyframe );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, astSet is applied to the SkyFrame pointer rather than the
FrameSet pointer, so the usual checks on FrameSet integrity do not
occur. The SkyFrame's Equinox attribute will therefore be modified
without any corresponding change to the FrameSet's Mappings.  In this
case you must take responsibility yourself for maintaining the
FrameSet's integrity, perhaps through appropriate use of
astRemapFrame.

\subsection{Merging FrameSets}

\begin{latexonly}
   As well as adding individual Frames to a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}
   (\secref{ss:addingframes}), it is also possible to add complete sets of
   inter-related Frames which are contained within another
   FrameSet. This, of course, corresponds to the process of merging two
   FrameSets (Figure~\ref{fig:fsmerge}).
   \begin{figure}[hbtp]
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{sun211_figures/fsmerge.eps}
   \caption{Two FrameSets in the process of being merged using
   \htmlref{astAddFrame}{astAddFrame}. FrameSet~B is being added to FrameSet~A by supplying a
   new \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which inter-relates a nominated \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} in A (here number~1)
   and the current Frame of B. In the merged FrameSet, the Frames
   contributed by B will be re-numbered to become Frames~4, 5 and 6. The
   base Frame will remain unchanged, but the current Frame of B becomes
   the new current Frame. Note that FrameSet~B itself is not
   altered by this process.}
   \label{fig:fsmerge}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
   As well as adding individual Frames to a FrameSet
   (\secref{ss:addingframes}), it is also possible to add complete sets of
   inter-related Frames which are contained within another
   FrameSet. This, of course, corresponds to the process of merging two
   FrameSets (see Figure below).
   \begin{quote}
   \begin{figure}[hbtp]
   \label{fig:fsmerge}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{sun211_figures/fsmerge.eps}
   \caption{Two FrameSets in the process of being merged using
   astAddFrame. FrameSet~B is being added to FrameSet~A by supplying a
   new Mapping which inter-relates a nominated Frame in A (here number~1)
   and the current Frame of B. In the merged FrameSet, the Frames
   contributed by B will be re-numbered to become Frames~4, 5 and 6. The
   base Frame will remain unchanged, but the current Frame of B becomes
   the new current Frame. Note that FrameSet~B itself is not
   altered by this process.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}

This process is performed by adding one FrameSet to another using
astAddFrame, in much the same manner as when adding a new Frame to an
existing FrameSet (\secref{ss:addingframes}). It is simply a matter of
providing a FrameSet pointer, instead of a Frame pointer, for the 4th
argument. In performing the merger you must, as usual, supply a
Mapping, but in this case the Mapping should relate the current Frame
of the FrameSet being added to one of the Frames already present. For
example, you might perform the merger shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:fsmerge} as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstMapping *mapping;

...

astAddFrame( frameseta, 1, mapping, framesetb );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The Frames acquired by ``frameseta'' from the FrameSet being added
(``framesetb'') are re-numbered so that they retain their original
order and follow on consecutively after the Frames that were already
present, whose indices remain unchanged. The base Frame of
``frameseta'' remains unchanged, but the current Frame of
``framesetb'' becomes its new current Frame. All the
inter-relationships between Frames in both FrameSets remain in place
and are preserved in the merged FrameSet.

Note that while this process modifies the first FrameSet
(``frameseta''), it leaves the original contents of the one being
added (``framesetb'') unchanged.

\cleardoublepage
\section{\label{ss:channels}Saving and Restoring Objects (Channels)}

Facilities are provided by the AST library for performing input and
output (I/O) with any kind of \htmlref{Object}{Object}. This means it is possible
to write any Object into various external representations for
storage, and then to read these representations back in, so as to
restore the original Object. Typically, an Object would be written by
one program and read back in by another.

We refer to ``external representations'' in the plural because AST is
designed to function independently of any particular data storage
system. This means that Objects may need converting into a number of
different external representations in order to be compatible with
(say) the astronomical data storage system in which they will reside.

In this section, we discuss the basic I/O facilities which support
external representations based on text. These are implemented using a
new kind of Object---a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}. We will examine later how
to use other representations, based on FITS headers, for storing
Objects. These are implemented using a more specialised form of
Channel called a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} (\secref{ss:nativefits}).

\subsection{The Channel Model}

The best way to start thinking about a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} is like a C file
stream, and to think of the process of creating a Channel as that
of opening a file and obtaining a FILE pointer.  Subsequently, you can
read and write Objects {\em{via}} the Channel.

This analogy is not quite perfect, however, because a Channel has, in
principle, two ``files'' attached to it. One is used when reading, and
the other when writing. These are termed the Channel's {\em{source}}
and {\em{sink}} respectively. In practice, the source and sink may
both be the same, in which case the analogy with the C file stream is
correct, but this need not always be so. It is not necessarily so with
the basic Channel, as we will now see (\secref{ss:creatingachannel}).

\subsection{\label{ss:creatingachannel}Creating a Channel}

The process of creating a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} is straightforward. As you
might expect, it uses the constructor function \htmlref{astChannel}{astChannel}:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
AstChannel *channel;

...

channel = astChannel( NULL, NULL, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The first two arguments to astChannel specify the external source and
sink that the Channel is to use. There arguments are pointers to C
functions and we will examine their use in more detail later
(\secref{ss:channelsource} and \secref{ss:channelsink}).

In this very simple example we have supplied NULL pointers for both
the source and sink functions. This requests the default behaviour,
which means that textual input will be read from the program's
standard input stream (typically, this means your keyboard) while
textual output will go to the standard output stream (typically
appearing on your screen). On UNIX systems, of course, either of these
streams can easily be redirected to files.

\subsection{\label{ss:writingtoachannel}Writing Objects to a Channel}

The process of saving Objects is very straightforward. You can
simply write any \htmlref{Object}{Object} to a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} using the \htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite}
function, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int nobj;
AstObject *object;

...

nobj = astWrite( channel, object );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The effect of this will be to produce a textual description of the
Object which will appear, by default, on your program's standard
output stream. Any class of Object may be converted into text in this
way.

astWrite returns a count of the number of Objects written. Usually,
this will be one, unless the Object supplied cannot be
represented. With a basic Channel all Objects can be represented, so a
value of one will always be returned unless there has been an
error. We will see later, however, that more specialised forms of
Channel may impose restrictions on the kind of Object you can write
(\secref{ss:foreignfitslimitations}). In such cases, astWrite may
return zero to indicate that the Object was not acceptable.

\subsection{\label{ss:readingfromachannel}Reading Objects from a Channel}

Before discussing the format of the output produced above
(\secref{ss:writingtoachannel}), let us consider how to read it back,
so as to reconstruct the original \htmlref{Object}{Object}. Naturally, we would first
need to save the output in a file. On UNIX systems, we can do that
simply by redirecting standard output to a file using a shell command
like:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
program1 >file
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Within a subsequent program, we can read this Object back in by
using the \htmlref{astRead}{astRead} function, having first created a suitable
\htmlref{Channel}{Channel}:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
object = astRead( channel );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

By default, this function will read from the standard input stream
(the default source for a basic Channel), so we would need to ensure
that our second program reads its input from the file in which the
Object description is stored. On UNIX systems, we could again use a
shell redirection command such as:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
program2 <file
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

\subsection{Saving and Restoring Multiple Objects}

I/O operations performed on a basic \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} are sequential. This
means that if you write more than one \htmlref{Object}{Object} to a Channel,
each new Object's textual description is simply appended to the
previous one. You can store any number of Objects in this way,
subject only to the storage space you have available.

After you read an Object back from a basic Channel, the
Channel is ``positioned'' at the end of that Object's
textual description. If you then perform another read, you will
read the next Object's textual description and therefore
retrieve the next Object.  This process may be repeated to read
each Object in turn. When there are no more Objects to be
read, \htmlref{astRead}{astRead} will return the value AST\_\_NULL to indicate an
{\em{end-of-file.}}

\subsection{\label{ss:validatinginput}Validating Input}

The pointer returned by \htmlref{astRead}{astRead} (\secref{ss:readingfromachannel}) could
identify any class of \htmlref{Object}{Object}---this is determined entirely by the
external data being read. If it is necessary to test for a particular
class (say a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}), this may be done as follows using the appropriate
member of the \htmlref{astIsA$<$Class$>$}{astIsAClass} family of functions:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int ok;

...

ok = astIsAFrame( object );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note, however, that this will accept any Frame, so would be equally
happy with a basic Frame or a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}.  An alternative validation
strategy would be to obtain the value of the Object's \htmlref{Class}{Class} attribute
and then test this character string, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <string.h>

...

ok = !strcmp( astGetC( object, "Class" ), "Frame" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This would only accept a basic Frame and would reject a SkyFrame.

\subsection{Storing an ID String with an Object}

Occasionally, you may want to store a number of Objects and later
retrieve them and use each for a different purpose. If the Objects are
of the same class, you cannot use the \htmlref{Class}{Class} attribute to distinguish
them when you read them back
({\em{c.f.}}~\secref{ss:validatinginput}). Although relying on the
order in which they are stored is a possible solution, this becomes
complicated if some of the Objects are optional and may not always be
present. It also makes extending your data format in future more
difficult.

To help with this, every AST \htmlref{Object}{Object} has an \htmlref{ID}{ID} attribute which allows
you, in effect, to attach a textual identification label to it. You
simply set the ID attribute before writing the Object:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( object, "ID=Calibration" );
nobj = astWrite( channel, object );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

You can then test its value after you read the Object back:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
object = astRead( channel );
if ( !strcmp( astGetC( object, "ID" ), "Calibration" ) ) {
   <the Calibration Object has been read>
} else {
   <some other Object has been read>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note that the ID attribute is unique to a particular Object and
is lost if, for example, you make a copy, so it is safest to set its
value immediately before you perform the write.

\subsection{\label{ss:textualoutputformat}The Textual Output Format} 

Let us now examine the format of the textual output produced by
writing an \htmlref{Object}{Object} to a basic \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}
(\secref{ss:writingtoachannel}). To give a concrete example, suppose
the Object in question is a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}, written out as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstSkyFrame *skyframe;

...

nobj = astWrite( channel, skyframe );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The output should then look like the following:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
 Begin SkyFrame 	# Description of celestial coordinate system
#   Title = "FK4 Equatorial Coordinates, no E-terms, Mean Equinox B1950.0, Epoch B1958.0" 	# Title of coordinate system
    Naxes = 2 	# Number of coordinate axes
#   Domain = "SKY" 	# Coordinate system domain
#   Lbl1 = "Right Ascension" 	# Label for axis 1
#   Lbl2 = "Declination" 	# Label for axis 2
#   Uni1 = "hh:mm:ss.s" 	# Units for axis 1
#   Uni2 = "ddd:mm:ss" 	# Units for axis 2
#   Dir1 = 0 	# Plot axis 1 in reverse direction (hint)
    Ax1 = 	# Axis number 1
       Begin SkyAxis 	# Celestial coordinate axis
       End SkyAxis
    Ax2 = 	# Axis number 2
       Begin SkyAxis 	# Celestial coordinate axis
       End SkyAxis
 IsA Frame 	# Coordinate system description
    System = "FK4-NO-E" 	# Celestial coordinate system type
    Epoch = 1958 	# Besselian epoch of observation
#   Eqnox = 1950 	# Besselian epoch of mean equinox
 End SkyFrame
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

You will notice that this output is designed both for a human reader,
in that it is formatted, and also to be read back by a computer in
order to reconstruct the SkyFrame. In fact, this is precisely the way
that \htmlref{astShow}{astShow} works (\secref{ss:displayingobjects}), this function being
roughly equivalent to the following use of a Channel:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
channel = astChannel( NULL, NULL, "" );
(void) astWrite( channel, object );
channel = astAnnul( channel );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Some lines of the output start with a ``\verb?#?'' comment character,
which turns the rest of the line into a comment. These lines will be
ignored when read back in by \htmlref{astRead}{astRead}.  They typically contain default
values, or values that can be derived in some way from the other data
present, so that they do not actually need to be stored in order to
reconstruct the original Object. They are provided purely for human
information. The same comment character is also used to append
explanatory comments to most output lines.

It is not sensible to attempt a complete description of this output
format because every class of Object is potentially different and each
can define how its own data should be represented. However, there are
some basic rules, which mean that the following common features will
usually be present:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each Object is delimited by matching ``Begin'' and ``End''
lines, which also identify the class of Object involved.

\item Within each Object description, data values are represented
by a simple ``keyword~$=$~value'' syntax, with one value to a line.

\item Lines beginning ``IsA'' are used to mark the divisions between
data belonging to different levels in the class hierarchy
(\appref{ss:classhierarchy}). Thus, ``IsA~\htmlref{Frame}{Frame}'' marks the end of data
associated with the Frame class and the start of data associated with
some derived class (a SkyFrame in the above example). ``IsA'' lines
may be omitted if associated data values are absent and no confusion
arises.

\item Objects may contain other Objects as data. This is
indicated by an absent value, with the description of the data
Object following on subsequent lines.

\item Indentation is used to clarify the overall structure.
\end{enumerate}

Beyond these general principles, the best guide to what a particular
line of output represents will generally be the comment which
accompanies it together with a general knowledge of the class of
Object being described.

\subsection{\label{ss:controllingchanneloutput}Controlling the Amount of Output}

It is not always necessary for the output from \htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite}
(\secref{ss:writingtoachannel}) to be human-readable, so a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} has
attributes that allow the amount of detail in the output to be
controlled.

The first of these is the integer attribute \htmlref{Full}{Full}, which controls the
extent to which optional, commented out, output lines are produced. By
default, Full is zero, and this results in the standard style of
output (\secref{ss:textualoutputformat}) where default values that may
be helpful to humans are included. To suppress these optional lines,
Full should be set to $-$1. This is most conveniently done when the
Channel is created, so that:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
channel = astChannel( NULL, NULL, "Full=-1" );
(void) astWrite( channel, skyframe );
channel = astAnnul( channel );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

would result in output containing only the essential information, such
as:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
 Begin SkyFrame 	# Description of celestial coordinate system
    Naxes = 2 	# Number of coordinate axes
    Ax1 = 	# Axis number 1
       Begin SkyAxis 	# Celestial coordinate axis
       End SkyAxis
    Ax2 = 	# Axis number 2
       Begin SkyAxis 	# Celestial coordinate axis
       End SkyAxis
 IsA Frame 	# Coordinate system description
    System = "FK4-NO-E" 	# Celestial coordinate system type
    Epoch = 1958 	# Besselian epoch of observation
 End SkyFrame
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

In contrast, setting Full to $+$1 will result in additional output
lines which will reveal every last detail of the \htmlref{Object}{Object}'s
construction. Often this will be rather more than you want, especially
for more complex Objects, but it can sometimes help when debugging
programs. This is how a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} appears at this level of detail:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
 Begin SkyFrame 	# Description of celestial coordinate system
#   RefCnt = 1 	# Count of active Object pointers
#   Nobj = 1 	# Count of active Objects in same class

#   Digits = 7 	# Default formatting precision
#   Fmt1 = "hms.1" 	# Format specifier for axis 1
#   Fmt2 = "dms" 	# Format specifier for axis 2
#   Dir1 = 0 	# Plot axis 1 in reverse direction (hint)
#   Dir2 = 1 	# Plot axis 2 in conventional direction (hint)
#   Presrv = 0 	# Don't preserve target axes
#   Permut = 1 	# Axes may be permuted to match
#   MinAx = 2 	# Minimum number of axes to match
#   MaxAx = 2 	# Maximum number of axes to match
#   MchEnd = 0 	# Match initial target axes
#   Prm1 = 1 	# Axis 1 not permuted
#   Prm2 = 2 	# Axis 2 not permuted
    Ax1 = 	# Axis number 1
       Begin SkyAxis 	# Celestial coordinate axis

#         Digits = 7 	# Default formatting precision
#         Format = "dms" 	# Format specifier
#         Dirn = 1 	# Plot in conventional direction
       IsA Axis 	# Coordinate axis
#         Format = "dms" 	# Format specifier
#         IsLat = 0 	# Longitude axis (not latitude)
#         AsTime = 0 	# Display values as angles (not times)
       End SkyAxis
    Ax2 = 	# Axis number 2
       Begin SkyAxis 	# Celestial coordinate axis
#         RefCnt = 1 	# Count of active Object pointers
#         Nobj = 2 	# Count of active Objects in same class
       IsA Object 	# Astrometry Object
#         Label = "Angle on Sky" 	# Axis Label

       IsA Axis 	# Coordinate axis
#         Format = "dms" 	# Format specifier
#         IsLat = 0 	# Longitude axis (not latitude)
#         AsTime = 0 	# Display values as angles (not times)
       End SkyAxis
 IsA Frame 	# Coordinate system description
    System = "FK4-NO-E" 	# Celestial coordinate system type
    Epoch = 1958 	# Besselian epoch of observation
#   Eqnox = 1950 	# Besselian epoch of mean equinox
 End SkyFrame
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

\subsection{\label{ss:channelcommenting}Controlling Commenting}

Another way of controlling output from a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} is {\em{via}} the
boolean (integer) \htmlref{Comment}{Comment} attribute, which controls whether comments
are appended to describe the purpose of each value. Comment has the
value 1 by default but, if set to zero, will suppress these
comments. This is normally appropriate only if you wish to minimise
the amount of output, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astSet( channel, "Full=-1, Comment=0" );
nobj = astWrite( channel, skyframe );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

might result in the following more compact output:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
 Begin SkyFrame
    Naxes = 2
    Ax1 =
       Begin SkyAxis
       End SkyAxis
    Ax2 =
       Begin SkyAxis
       End SkyAxis
 IsA Frame
    System = "FK4-NO-E"
    Epoch = 1958
 End SkyFrame
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

\subsection{Editing Textual Output}

The safest advice about editing the textual output from \htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite} (or
\htmlref{astShow}{astShow}) is ``don't!''---unless you know what you are doing.

Having given that warning, however, it is sometimes possible to make
changes to the text, or even to write entire \htmlref{Object}{Object} descriptions from
scratch, and to read the results back in to construct new
Objects. Normally, simple changes to numerical values are safest, but
be aware that this is a back door method of creating Objects, so
you are on your own! There are a number of potential pitfalls. In
particular:

\begin{itemize}
\item \htmlref{astRead}{astRead} is intended for retrieving data written by astWrite and
not for reading data input by humans. As such, the data validation
provided is very limited and is certainly not foolproof. This makes it
quite easy to construct Objects that are internally inconsistent by
this means. In contrast, the normal programming interface incorporates
numerous checks designed to make it impossible to construct invalid
Objects. You should not necessarily think you have found a bug if your
changes to an Object's textual description fail to produce the results
you expected!

\item In many instances the names associated with values in textual
output will correspond with Object attributes. Sometimes, however,
these names may differ from the attribute name. This is mainly because
of length restrictions imposed by other common external formats, such
as FITS headers. Some of the names used do not correspond with
attributes at all.

\item It is safest to change single numerical or string values.
Beware of changing the size or shape of Objects ({\em{e.g.}}\ the
number of axes in a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}). Often, these values must match others
stored elsewhere within the Object and changing them in a haphazard
fashion will not produce useful results.

\item Be wary about un-commenting default values. Sometimes this will
work, but often these values are derived from other Objects stored
more deeply in the structure and the proper place to insert a new
value is not where the default itself appears.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\label{ss:mixingchanneltext}Mixing Objects with other Text}

By default, when you use \htmlref{astRead}{astRead} to read from a basic \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}
(\secref{ss:readingfromachannel}), it is assumed that you are reading a
stream of text containing only AST Objects, which follow each other
end-to-end. If any extraneous input data are encountered which do not
appear to form part of the textual description of an \htmlref{Object}{Object}, then an
error will result. In particular, the first input line must identify
the start of an Object description, so you cannot start reading half
way through an Object.

Sometimes, however, you may want to store AST Object descriptions
intermixed with other textual data. You can do this by setting the
Channel's boolean (integer) \htmlref{Skip}{Skip} attribute to 1. This will cause every
read to skip over extraneous data until the start of a new AST Object
description, if any, is found. So long as your other data do not mimic
the appearance of an AST Object description, the two sets of data can
co-exist.

For example, by setting Skip to 1, the following complete C program
will read all the AST Objects whose descriptions appear in the source
of this document, ignoring the other text. \htmlref{astShow}{astShow} is used to display
those found:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
main() {
   AstChannel *channel;
   AstObject *object;

   channel = astChannel( NULL, NULL, "Skip=1" );
   while ( ( object = astRead( channel ) ) != AST__NULL ) {
      astShow( object );
      object = astAnnul( object );
   }
   channel = astAnnul( channel );
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

\subsection{\label{ss:channelsource}Reading Objects from Files}

Thus far, we have only considered the default behaviour of a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}
in reading and writing Objects through a program's standard input and
output streams. We will now consider how to access Objects stored in
files more directly.

Because the AST library is designed to be used from more than one
language, it has to be a little careful about reading and writing to
files. This is due to the incompatibilities that often exist between
the file I/O facilities provided by different languages.  Fortunately,
this ties in well with the principle that AST should also be
independent of any particular data storage system, which we mention
again in \secref{ss:otherplaces}.

What this means in practice is that you must provide some simple C
functions that perform the actual transfer of data to and from files
and similar external data stores. The functions you provide are
supplied as the source and/or sink function arguments to \htmlref{astChannel}{astChannel}
when you create a Channel (\secref{ss:creatingachannel}). An example is
the best way to illustrate this.

Consider the following simple function called Source. It reads a
single line of text from a C input stream and returns a pointer to it,
or NULL if there is no more input:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>
#define LEN 200
static FILE *input_stream;

const char *Source( void ) {
   static char buffer[ LEN + 2 ];
   return fgets( buffer, LEN + 2, input_stream );
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note that the input stream is a static variable which we will also
access from our main program. This might look something like this
(omitting error checking for brevity):

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
/* Open the input file. */
input_stream = fopen( "infile.ast", "r" );

/* Create a Channel and read an Object from it. */
channel = astChannel( Source, NULL, "" );
object = astRead( channel );

...

/* Annul the Channel and close the file when done. */
channel = astAnnul( channel );
(void) fclose( input_stream );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, we first open the required input file, saving the resulting FILE
pointer. We then pass a pointer to our Source function as the first
argument to astChannel when creating a new Channel. When we read
an \htmlref{Object}{Object} from this Channel with \htmlref{astRead}{astRead}, the Source
function will be called to obtain the textual data from the file, the
end-of-file being detected when this function returns NULL.

\subsection{\label{ss:channelsink}Writing Objects to Files}

We can also write a Sink function, that writes a line of output text
to a file, and use it in basically the same way as the Source function
in the previous section (\secref{ss:channelsource}):

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
static FILE *output_stream;

void Sink( const char *line ) {
   (void) fprintf( output_stream, "%s\n", line );
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note that we must supply the final newline character ourselves.

In this case, our main program would supply a pointer to this Sink
function as the second argument to \htmlref{astChannel}{astChannel}, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
/* Open the output file. */
output_stream = fopen( "outfile.ast", "w" );

/* Create a Channel and write an Object to it. */
channel = astChannel( Source, Sink, "" );
nobj = astWrite( channel, object );

   ...

/* Annul the Channel and close the file when done. */
channel = astAnnul( channel );
(void) fclose( output_stream );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note that we can specify a source and/or a sink function for the
\htmlref{Channel}{Channel}, and that these may use either the same file, or different
files according to whether we are reading or writing. AST has no
knowledge of the underlying file system, nor of file positioning. It
just reads and writes sequentially. If you wish, for example, to
reposition a file at the beginning in between reads and writes, then
this can be done directly (and completely independently of AST) using
standard C functions.

If an error occurs in your source or sink function, you can
communicate this to the AST library by setting its error status to any
error value using \htmlref{astSetStatus}{astSetStatus} (\secref{ss:errordetection}). This will
immediately terminate the read or write operation.

\subsection{\label{ss:otherplaces}Reading and Writing Objects to other Places}

It should be obvious from the above (\secref{ss:channelsource} and
\secref{ss:channelsink}) that a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}'s source and sink functions
provide a flexible means of intercepting textual data that describes
AST Objects as it flows in and out of your program. In fact, you might
like to regard a Channel simply as a filter for converting AST Objects
to and from a stream of text which is then handled by your source and
sink functions, where the real I/O occurs.

This gives you the ability to store AST Objects in virtually any data
system, so long as you can convert a stream of text into something
that can be stored (it need no longer be text) and retrieve it
again. There is generally no need to retain comments.  Other
possibilities, such as inter-process and network communication, could
also be implemented {\em{via}} source and sink functions in basically
the same way.

\section{\label{ss:nativefits}Storing AST Objects in FITS Headers (FitsChans)}

\begin{latexonly}
A FITS header is a sequence of 80-character strings, formatted
according to particular rules defined by the Flexible Image Transport
\htmlref{System}{System}
(FITS). FITS\footnote{http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/fits/fits\_home.html}
is a widely-used standard for data interchange in astronomy and has
also been adopted as a data processing format in some astronomical
data reduction systems.  The individual 80-character strings in a FITS
header are usually called {\em{cards}} or {\em{header cards}} (for
entirely anachronistic reasons).
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
A FITS header is a sequence of 80-character strings, formatted
according to particular rules defined by the Flexible Image Transport
System (FITS).
\htmladdnormallink{FITS}{http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/fits/fits_home.html}
is a widely-used standard for data interchange in astronomy and has
also been adopted as a data processing format in some astronomical
data reduction systems.  The individual 80-character strings in a FITS
header are usually called {\em{cards}} or {\em{header cards}} (for
entirely anachronistic reasons).
\end{htmlonly}

A sequence of FITS cards appears as a header at the start of every
FITS data file, and sometimes also at other points within it, and is
used to provide ancillary information which qualifies or describes the
main array of data stored in the file. As such, FITS headers are prime
territory for storing information about the coordinate systems
associated with data held in FITS files.

In this section, we will examine how to store information in FITS
headers directly in the form of AST Objects---a process which is
supported by a specialised class of \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} called a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}. Our
discussion here will turn out to be a transitional step that
emphasises the similarities between a FitsChan and a Channel
(\secref{ss:channels}). At the same time, it will prepare us for the
next section (\secref{ss:foreignfits}), where we will examine how to
use a FitsChan to tackle some of the more difficult problems that FITS
headers can present.

\subsection{\label{ss:nativeencoding}The Native FITS Encoding}

As it turns out, we are not the first to have thought of storing WCS
information in FITS headers. In fact, the original FITS standard (1981
vintage) defined a set of header keywords for this purpose which have
been widely used, although they have proved too limited for many
practical purposes.

At the time of writing, a number of different ways of using FITS
headers for storing WCS information are in use, most (although not
all) based on the original standard. We will refer to these
alternative ways of storing the information as FITS {\em{encodings}}
but will defer a discussion of their advantages and limitations until
the next section (\secref{ss:foreignfits}).

Here, we will examine how to store AST Objects directly in FITS
headers. In effect, this defines a new encoding, which we will term
the {\em{native encoding.}} This is a special kind of encoding,
because not only does it allow us to associate conventional
WCS calibration information with FITS data, but it also allows any other
information that can be expressed in terms of AST Objects to be stored
as well.  In fact, the native encoding provides us with facilities
roughly analogous to those of the \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}
(\secref{ss:channels})---{\em{i.e.}}\ a lossless way of
transferring AST Objects from program to program---but based on FITS
headers instead of free-format text.

\subsection{The FitsChan Model}

I/O between AST Objects and FITS headers is supported by a specialised
form of \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} called a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}. A FitsChan contains a buffer which
may hold any number, including zero, of FITS header cards. This buffer
forms a workspace in which you can assemble FITS cards and manipulate
them before writing them out to a FITS file.

By default, when a FitsChan is first created, it contains no cards and
there are three ways of inserting cards into it:

\begin{enumerate}
\item You may add cards yourself, one at a time, using \htmlref{astPutFits}{astPutFits}
(\secref{ss:addingfitscards}).

\item You may write an AST \htmlref{Object}{Object} to the FitsChan (using \htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite}),
which will have the effect of creating new cards within the FitsChan
which describe the Object (\secref{ss:writingnativefits}).

\item You may specify a source function which reads data from some
external store of FITS cards, just like the source associated with a
basic Channel (\secref{ss:channelsource}). If you supply a source
function, it will be called when the FitsChan is created in order to
fill it with an initial set of cards (\secref{ss:fitssourceandsink}).
\end{enumerate}

There are also three ways of removing cards from a FitsChan:

\begin{enumerate}
\item You may delete cards yourself, one at a time, using \htmlref{astDelFits}{astDelFits}
(\secref{ss:findingandchangingfits}).

\item You may read an AST Object from the FitsChan (using \htmlref{astRead}{astRead}),
which will have the effect of removing those cards from the FitsChan
which describe the Object (\secref{ss:readingnativefits}).

\item You may specify a sink function which writes data to some
external store of FITS cards, just like the sink associated with a
basic Channel (\secref{ss:channelsink}). If you supply a sink function,
it will be called when the FitsChan is deleted in order to write out
any FITS cards that remain in it (\secref{ss:fitssourceandsink}).
\end{enumerate}
 
Note, in particular, that reading an AST Object from a FitsChan is
{\em{destructive.}} That is, it deletes the FITS cards that describe the
Object. The reason for this is explained in
\secref{ss:destructiveread}.

In addition to the above, you may also read individual cards from a
FitsChan using the function \htmlref{astFindFits}{astFindFits} (which is not
destructive). This is the main means of writing out FITS cards if you
have not supplied a sink function.  astFindFits also provides a means
of searching for particular FITS cards (by keyword, for example) and
there are other facilities for overwriting cards when required
(\secref{ss:findingandchangingfits}).

\subsection{\label{ss:creatingafitschan}Creating a FitsChan}

The \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} constructor function, \htmlref{astFitsChan}{astFitsChan}, is straightforward to
use:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
AstFitsChan *fitschan;

...

fitschan = astFitsChan( NULL, NULL, "Encoding=NATIVE" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, we have omitted any source or sink functions by supplying NULL
pointers for the first two arguments.
We have also initialised the FitsChan's \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} attribute to
NATIVE. This indicates that we will be using the native encoding
(\secref{ss:nativeencoding}) to store and retrieve Objects. If this
was left unspecified, the default would depend on the FitsChan's
contents. An attempt is made to use whatever encoding appears to have
been used previously. For an empty FitsChan, the default is NATIVE,
but it does no harm to be sure.

\subsection{\label{ss:addressingfitscards}Addressing Cards in a FitsChan}

Because a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} contains an ordered sequence of header cards, a
mechanism is needed for addressing them. This allows you to specify
where new cards are to be added, for example, or which card is to be
deleted.

This role is filled by the FitsChan's integer \htmlref{Card}{Card} attribute, which
gives the index of the {\em{current card}} in the FitsChan.  You can
nominate any card you like to be current, simply by setting a new
value for the Card attribute, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int icard;

...

astSetI( fitschan, "Card", icard )
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

where ``icard'' contains the index of the card on which you wish to
operate next.  Some functions will update the Card attribute as a
means of advancing through the sequence of cards, when reading them
for example, or to indicate which card matches a search criterion.

The default value for Card is one, which is the index of the first
card. This means that you can ``rewind'' a FitsChan to access its
first card by clearing the Card attribute:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astClear( fitschan, "Card" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The total number of cards in a FitsChan is given by the integer \htmlref{Ncard}{Ncard}
attribute. This is a read-only attribute whose value is automatically
updated as you add or remove cards. It means you can address all the
cards in sequence using a loop such as the following:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int ncard;

...

ncard = astGetI( fitschan, "Ncard" );
for ( icard = 1; icard <= ncard; icard++ ) {
   astSetI( fitschan, "Card", icard );
   <access the current card>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

However, it is usually possible to write slightly tidier loops based
on the \htmlref{astFindFits}{astFindFits} function described later
(\secref{ss:extractingfitscards} and
\secref{ss:findingandchangingfits}).

If you set the Card attribute to a value larger than Ncard, the
FitsChan is regarded as being positioned at its {\em{end-of-file.}} In
this case there is no current card and an attempt to obtain a value
for the Card attribute will always return the value Ncard~$+$~1. When
a FitsChan is empty, it is always at the end-of-file.
 
\subsection{\label{ss:writingnativefits}Writing Native Objects to a FitsChan}

Having created an empty \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} (\secref{ss:creatingafitschan}), you
can write any AST \htmlref{Object}{Object} to it in the native encoding using the
\htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite} function. Let us assume we are writing a
\htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame},\footnote{More probably, you would want to write a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet},
but for purposes of illustration a SkyFrame contains a more manageable
amount of data.} as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstSkyFrame *skyframe;
int nobj;

...

nobj = astWrite( fitschan, skyframe );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Since we have selected the native encoding
(\secref{ss:nativeencoding}), there are no restrictions on the class
of Object we may write, so astWrite should always return a value of
one, unless an error occurs. Unlike a basic \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}
(\secref{ss:writingtoachannel}), this write operation will not produce
any output from our program. The FITS headers produced are simply
stored inside the FitsChan.

After this write operation, the \htmlref{Ncard}{Ncard} attribute will be updated to
reflect the number of new cards added to the FitsChan and the \htmlref{Card}{Card}
attribute will point at the card immediately after the last one
written. Since our FitsChan was initially empty, the Card attribute
will, in this example, point at the end-of-file
(\secref{ss:addressingfitscards}).

The FITS standard imposes a limit of 68 characters on the length of
strings which may be stored in a single header card. Sometimes, a
description of an AST Object involves the use of strings which exceed
this limit ({\em{e.g.}}\ a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} title can be of arbitrary length). If
this occurs, the long string will be split over two or more header cards.
Each ``continuation'' card will have the keyword {\tt CONTINUE} in
columns 1 to 8, and will contain a space in column 9 (instead of the
usual equals sign). An ampersand (``{\tt \&}'') is appended to the end of
each of the strings (except the last one) to indicate that the string is
continued on the next card. 

Note, this splitting of long strings over several cards only occurs when
writing AST Objects to a FitsChan using the astWrite function and the
{\em native} encoding. If a long string is stored in a FitsChan using
(for instance) the \htmlref{astPutFits}{astPutFits} function, it will simply be truncated.


\subsection{\label{ss:extractingfitscards}Extracting Individual Cards from a FitsChan}

To examine the contents of the \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} after writing the \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}
above (\secref{ss:writingnativefits}), we must write a simple loop to
extract each card in turn and print it out. We must also remember to
rewind the FitsChan first, {\em{e.g.}}\ using \htmlref{astClear}{astClear}. The following
loop would do:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>
char card[ 81 ];

...

astClear( fitschan, "Card" );
while ( astFindFits( fitschan, "%f", card, 1 ) ) (void) printf( "%s\n", card );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, we have used the \htmlref{astFindFits}{astFindFits} function to find a FITS card by
keyword. It is given a keyword template of ``\%f'', which matches any
FITS keyword, so it always finds the current card, which it
returns. Its fourth argument is set to 1, to indicate that the \htmlref{Card}{Card}
attribute should be incremented afterwards so that the following card
will be found the next time around the loop. astFindFits returns zero
when it reaches the end-of-file and this terminates the loop.

If we were storing the FITS headers in an output FITS file instead of
printing them out, we might use a loop like this but replace
``printf'' with a suitable data storage operation. This would only be
necessary if we had not provided a sink function for the FitsChan
(\secref{ss:fitssourceandsink}).

\subsection{The Native FitsChan Output Format}

If we print out the FITS header cards describing the \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} we wrote
earlier (\secref{ss:writingnativefits}), we should obtain something
like the following:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
COMMENT AST ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ AST
COMMENT AST            Beginning of AST data for SkyFrame object             AST
COMMENT AST ................................................................ AST
BEGAST_A= 'SkyFrame'           / Description of celestial coordinate system     
NAXES_A =                    2 / Number of coordinate axes                      
AX1_A   = '        '           / Axis number 1                                  
BEGAST_B= 'SkyAxis '           / Celestial coordinate axis                      
ENDAST_A= 'SkyAxis '           / End of object definition                       
AX2_A   = '        '           / Axis number 2                                  
BEGAST_C= 'SkyAxis '           / Celestial coordinate axis                      
ENDAST_B= 'SkyAxis '           / End of object definition                       
ISA_A   = 'Frame   '           / Coordinate system description                  
SYSTEM_A= 'FK4-NO-E'           / Celestial coordinate system type               
EPOCH_A =               1958.0 / Besselian epoch of observation                 
ENDAST_C= 'SkyFrame'           / End of object definition                       
COMMENT AST ................................................................ AST
COMMENT AST               End of AST data for SkyFrame object                AST
COMMENT AST ---------------------------------------------------------------- AST
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

As you can see, this resembles the information that would be written
to a basic \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} to describe the same SkyFrame
(\secref{ss:textualoutputformat}), except that it has been formatted
into 80-character header cards according to FITS conventions.

There are also a number of other differences worth noting:

\begin{enumerate}
\item There is no unnecessary information about default values
provided for the benefit of the human reader. This is because the \htmlref{Full}{Full}
attribute for a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} defaults to $-$1, thus suppressing this
information ({\em{c.f.}}~\secref{ss:controllingchanneloutput}). You
can restore the information if you wish by setting Full to 0 or $+$1,
in which case additional COMMENT cards will be generated to hold it.

\item The information is not indented, because FITS does not allow
this. However, if you change the Full attribute to 0 or $+$1, comments
will be included that are intended to help break up the sequence of
headers and highlight its structure. This will probably only be of use
if you are attempting to track down a problem by examining the FITS
cards produced in detail.

\item The FITS keywords which appear to the left of the ``$=$'' signs
have additional characters (``\_A'', ``\_B'', {\em{etc.}}) appended to
them. This is done in order to make each keyword unique.
\end{enumerate}

This last point is worth further comment and is necessary because the
FITS standard only allows for certain keywords (such as COMMENT and
HISTORY) to appear more than once. \htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite} therefore appends an
arbitrary sequence of two characters to each new keyword it generates
in order to ensure that it does not duplicate any already present in
the FitsChan.

The main risk from not following this convention is that some software
might ignore (say) all but the last occurrence of a keyword before
passing the FITS headers on. Such an event is unlikely, but would
obviously destroy the information present, so astWrite enforces the
uniqueness of the keywords it uses. The extra characters added are
ignored when the information is read back.

As with a basic Channel, you can also suppress the comments produced
in a FitsChan by setting the boolean (integer) \htmlref{Comment}{Comment} attribute to
zero (\secref{ss:channelcommenting}). However, FITS headers are
traditionally generously commented, so this is not recommended.

\subsection{\label{ss:addingfitscards}Adding Individual Cards to a FitsChan}

To insert individual cards into a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}, prior to reading them back
as Objects for example, you should use the \htmlref{astPutFits}{astPutFits} function. You
can insert a card in front of the current one as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astPutFits( fitschan, card, 0 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

where the third argument of zero indicates that the current card
should not be overwritten. Note that facilities are not provided by
AST for formatting the card contents.

After inserting a card, the FitsChan's \htmlref{Card}{Card} attribute points at the
original Card, or at the end-of-file if the FitsChan was originally
empty. Entering a sequence of cards is therefore straightforward. If
``cards'' is an array of pointers to strings containing FITS header
cards and ``ncards'' is the number of cards, then a loop such as the
following will insert the cards in sequence into a FitsChan:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#define MAXCARD 100
char *cards[ MAXCARD ];
int ncard;

...

for ( icard = 0; icard < ncard; icard++ ) astPutFits( fitschan, cards[ icard ], 0 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The string containing a card need not be null terminated if it is at
least 80 characters long (we have not allocated space for the strings
themselves in this brief example).

Note that astPutFits enforces the validity of a FitsChan by rejecting
any cards which do not adhere to the FITS standard. If any such cards
are detected, an error will result.

\subsection{\label{ss:readingnativefits}Reading Native Objects From a FitsChan}

Once you have stored a FITS header description of an \htmlref{Object}{Object} in a
\htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} using the native encoding (\secref{ss:writingnativefits}),
you can read it back using \htmlref{astRead}{astRead} in much the same way as with a
basic \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} (\secref{ss:readingfromachannel}). Similar comments
about validating the Object you read also apply
(\secref{ss:validatinginput}).  If you have just written to the
FitsChan, you must remember to rewind it first:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstObject *object;

...

astClear( fitschan, "Card" );
object = astRead( fitschan );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

An important feature of a FitsChan is that read operations are
destructive. This means that if an Object description is found, it
will be consumed by astRead which will remove all the cards involved,
including associated COMMENT cards, from the FitsChan. Thus, if you
write an Object to a FitsChan, rewind, and read the same Object back,
you should end up with the original FitsChan contents.  If you need to
circumvent this behaviour for any reason, it is a simple matter to
make a copy of a FitsChan using \htmlref{astCopy}{astCopy}
(\secref{ss:copyingobjects}). If you then read from the copy, the
original FitsChan will remain untouched.

After a read completes, the FitsChan's \htmlref{Card}{Card} attribute identifies the
card immediately following the last card read, or the end-of-file of
there are no more cards.

Since the {\em native} encoding is being used, any long strings involved
in the object description will have been split into two or more adjacent
contuation cards when the Object was stored in the header using function
\htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite}. The astRead function reverses this process by concatenating any
such adjacent continuation cards to re-create the original long string.


\subsection{Saving and Restoring Multiple Objects in a FitsChan}

When using the native FITS encoding, multiple Objects may be stored
and all I/O operations are sequential.  This means that you can simply
write a sequence of Objects to a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}. After each write operation,
the \htmlref{Card}{Card} attribute will be updated so that the next write appends the
next \htmlref{Object}{Object} description to the previous one.

If you then rewind the FitsChan, you can read the Objects back in the
original order. Reading them back will, of course, remove their
descriptions from the FitsChan (\secref{ss:readingnativefits}) but the
behaviour of the Card attribute is such that successive reads will
simply return each Object in sequence.

The only thing that may require care, given that a FitsChan can always
be addressed randomly by setting its Card attribute, is to avoid
writing one Object on top of another. For obvious reasons, the Object
descriptions in a FitsChan must remain separate if they are to make
sense when read back.

\subsection{Mixing Native Objects with Other FITS Cards}

Of course, any real FITS header will contain other information besides
AST Objects, if only the mandatory FITS cards that must accompany all
FITS data. When FITS headers are read in from a real dataset,
therefore, any native AST \htmlref{Object}{Object} descriptions will be inter-mixed with
many other cards.

Because this is the normal state of affairs, the boolean (integer)
\htmlref{Skip}{Skip} attribute for a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} defaults to one. This means that when
you read an Object From a FitsChan, any irrelevant cards will simply
be skipped over until the start of the next Object description, if
any, is found. If you start reading part way through an Object
description, no error will result. The remainder of the description
will simply be skipped.

Setting Skip to zero will change this behaviour to resemble that of a
basic \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} (\secref{ss:mixingchanneltext}), where extraneous data
are not permitted by default, but this will probably rarely be useful.

\subsection{\label{ss:findingandchangingfits}Finding and Changing Cards in a FitsChan}

You can search for, and retrieve, particular cards in a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} by
keyword, using the function \htmlref{astFindFits}{astFindFits}. This performs a search,
starting at the current card, until it finds a card whose keyword
matches the template you supply, or the end-of-file is reached.

If a suitable card is found, astFindFits optionally returns the card's
contents and then sets the FitsChan's \htmlref{Card}{Card} attribute either to
identify the card found, or the one following it. The way you want the
Card attribute to be set is indicated by the final boolean (int)
argument to astFindFits. A value of one is returned to indicate
success.  If a suitable card cannot be found, astFindFits returns a
value of zero to indicate failure and sets the FitsChan's Card
attribute to the end-of-file.

Requesting that the Card attribute be set to indicate the card that
astFindFits finds is useful if you want to replace that card with a
new one, as in this example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
char newcard[ 81 ];

...

(void) astFindFits( fitschan, "AIRMASS", NULL, 0 );
astPutFits( fitschan, newcard, 1 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, astFindFits is used to search for a card with the keyword
AIRMASS, with a NULL pointer being given to indicate that we do not
want the card's contents returned. If the card is found, \htmlref{astPutFits}{astPutFits}
then overwrites it with a new card.  Otherwise, the Card attribute
ends up pointing at the end-of-file and the new card is simply
appended to the end of the FitsChan.

A similar approach can be used to delete selected cards from a
FitsChan using \htmlref{astDelFits}{astDelFits}, which deletes the current card:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
if ( astFindFits( fitschan, "BSCALE", NULL, 0 ) ) astDelFits( fitschan );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This deletes the first card, if any, with the BSCALE keyword.

Requesting that astFindFits increments the Card attribute to identify
the card following the one found is more useful when writing loops.
For example, the following loop extracts each card whose keyword
matches the template ``CD\%6d'' (that is, ``CD'' followed by six
decimal digits):

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
while ( astFindFits( fitschan, "CD%6d", card, 1 ) {
   <process the card's contents>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

For further details of keyword templates, see the description of
astFindFits in \appref{ss:functiondescriptions}.

\subsection{\label{ss:fitssourceandsink}Source and Sink Functions for FitsChans}

The use of source and sink functions with a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} is optional. This
is because you can always arrange to explicitly fill a FitsChan with
FITS cards (\secref{ss:addingfitscards}) and you can also extract any
cards that remain and write them out yourself
(\secref{ss:extractingfitscards}) before you delete the FitsChan.

If you choose to use these functions, however, they behave in a very
similar manner to those used by a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} (\secref{ss:channelsource}
and \secref{ss:channelsink}). You supply pointers to these functions,
as arguments to the constructor function \htmlref{astFitsChan}{astFitsChan} when you create
the FitsChan (\secref{ss:creatingafitschan}). The source function is
invoked implicitly at this point to fill the FitsChan with FITS cards
and the FitsChan is then rewound, so that the first card becomes
current. The sink function is automatically invoked later, when the
FitsChan is deleted, in order to write out any cards that remain in
it.

The only real difference between the source and sink functions for a
FitsChan and a basic Channel is that FITS cards are limited in length
to 80~characters, so the choice of buffer size is simplified.  The
``Source'' and ``Sink'' functions in \secref{ss:channelsource} and
\secref{ss:channelsink} could therefore be used to access FITS headers
stored in text files simply by changing LEN to be 80.  If you were not
accessing a text file, however, appropriate changes to the I/O
statements would be needed since the separating newline characters
would be absent. The details obviously depend on the format of the
file you are handling, which need not necessarily be a true FITS file.

\section{\label{ss:foreignfits}Using Foreign FITS Encodings}

We saw in the previous section (\secref{ss:nativefits}) how to store
and retrieve any kind of AST \htmlref{Object}{Object} in a FITS header by using a
\htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}. To achieve this, we set the FitsChan's \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} attribute to
NATIVE. However, the Objects we wrote could then only be read back by
other programs that use AST.

In practice, we will also encounter FITS headers containing WCS
information written by other software systems.  We will probably also
need to write FITS headers in a format that can be understood by these
systems. Indeed, this interchange of data is one of the main reasons
for the existence of FITS, so in this section we will examine how to
accommodate these requirements.

\subsection{\label{ss:foreignencodings}The Foreign FITS Encodings}

As mentioned previously (\secref{ss:nativeencoding}), there are a
number of conventions currently in use for storing WCS information in
FITS headers, which we call {\em{encodings.}} Here, we are concerned
with those encodings defined by software systems other than AST, which
we term {\em{foreign encodings.}}

Currently, AST supports three foreign encodings, which may be selected
by setting the \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} attribute of a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} to one of the
following (character string) values:

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item[DSS]\mbox{}\\
This encoding stores WCS information using the convention developed at
the Space Telescope Science Institute for the Digitised Sky Survey
(DSS) astrometric plate calibrations.  DSS images which use this
convention are widely available and it is understood by a number of
important and well-established astronomy applications.

However, the calibration model used (based on a polynomial fit) is not
easily applicable to other types of data and creating the polynomial
coefficients needed to calibrate your own images can prove
difficult. For this reason, the DSS encoding is probably best viewed
as a ``read-only'' format. It is possible, however, to read in WCS
information using this encoding and then to write it back out again,
so long as only minor changes have been made.

\item[FITS-WCS]\mbox{}\\
This encoding is potentially very important because it is based on a
proposed new FITS standard which should, for the first time, address
the problem of celestial coordinate systems in a proper manner, by
considerably extending the original FITS standard.

The convention used is described in the draft paper ``Representation
of celestial coordinates in FITS'' \htmladdnormallinkfoot{(the
FITS-WCS paper)}{http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.html}
by E.W.\,Greisen and M.\,Calabretta (Astronomy \& Astrophysics, in
preparation). Once a new FITS standard has been agreed, this encoding
should be understood by any FITS-WCS compliant software and it is
likely to be adopted widely for FITS data in future.  However, this
proposed standard is still evolving, and while this continues we
intend that the AST implementation should track it.

\footnote{After a long and chequered history, the FITS-WCS proposal 
finally seems to be stabilizing. The version currently implemented within
AST -- based on the use of {\tt CDi\_j} keywords to describe axis scaling
and rotation -- seems likely to be adopted as the official standard
sometime during the year 2001, although obviously the possibility of
change before then cannot be ruled out.}

\item[FITS-IRAF]\mbox{}\\
This encoding is based on the conventions described in the document
``World Coordinate Systems Representations Within the FITS Format'' by R.J.
Hanisch and D.G. Wells, 1988.\footnote{Available by ftp from
fits.cv.nrao.edu /fits/documents/wcs/wcs88.ps.Z} It is currently employed
by the IRAF data analysis facility, so its use will facilitate data
exchange with IRAF. This encoding is in effect a sub-set of the current
FITS-WCS encoding.

\item[FITS-PC]\mbox{}\\
This encoding is based on a previous version of the proposed new FITS WCS
standard which used {\tt PCjjjjiii} and {\tt CDELTj} keywords to describe
axis rotation and scaling. Versions of AST prior to V1.5 used this scheme
for the FITS-WCS encoding. As of V1.5, FITS-WCS uses {\tt CDi\_j}
keywords instead.\footnote{There are many other differences between the
previous and the current FITS-WCS encodings. The keywords to describe
axis rotation and scaling is used purely as a label to identify the
scheme.} The FITS-PC encoding is included in AST V1.5 only to allow
FITS-WCS data created with previous versions to be read. It should not,
in general, be used to create new data sets.

\item[FITS-AIPS]\mbox{}\\
This encoding is based on the conventions described in the document
``Non-linear Coordinate Systems in AIPS'' by Eric W. Greisen (revised 9th
September, 1994).\footnote{Available by ftp from fits.cv.nrao.edu
/fits/documents/wcs/aips27.ps.Z} It is currently employed by the AIPS
data analysis facility, so its use will facilitate data exchange with
AIPS. This encoding uses {\tt CROTAi} and {\tt CDELTi} keywords to
describe axis rotation and scaling.
\end{description}
\end{quote}

For more detail about the above encodings, see the description of the
Encoding attribute in \appref{ss:attributedescriptions}.

\subsection{\label{ss:foreignfitslimitations}Limitations of Foreign Encodings}

The foreign encodings available for storing WCS information in FITS
headers have a number of limitations when compared with the native
encoding of AST Objects (\secref{ss:nativefits}). The main ones are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Only one class of AST \htmlref{Object}{Object}, the \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, may be represented
using a foreign FITS encoding. This should not come as a surprise,
because the purpose of storing WCS information in FITS headers is to
attach coordinate systems to an associated array of data. Since the
FrameSet is the AST Object designed for the same purpose
(\secref{ss:baseandcurrent}), there is a natural correspondence.

The way in which a FrameSet is translated to and from the foreign
encoding also follows from this correspondence. The FrameSet's base
\htmlref{Frame}{Frame} identifies the data grid coordinates of the associated FITS
data. These are the same as FITS pixel coordinates, in which the first
pixel (in 2 dimensions) has coordinates (1,1) at its
centre. Similarly, the current Frame of the FrameSet identifies the
FITS world coordinate system associated with the data.

\item You may store a representation of only a single FrameSet in any
individual set of FITS header cards ({\em{i.e.}}\ in a single
\htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}) at one time. If you attempt to store more than one, you may
over-write the previous one or generate an invalid representation of
your WCS information.

This is mainly a consequence of the use of fixed FITS keywords by
foreign encodings and the fact that you cannot, in general, have
multiple FITS cards with the same keyword.

\item In general, it will not be possible to store every possible
FrameSet that you might construct. Depending on the encoding, only
certain FrameSets that conform to particular restrictions can be
represented and, even then, some of their information may be lost. See
the description of the \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} attribute in
\appref{ss:attributedescriptions} for more details of these
limitations.
\end{enumerate}

It should be understood that using foreign encodings to read and write
information held in AST Objects is essentially a process of converting
the data format. As such, it potentially suffers from the same
problems faced by all such processes, {\em{i.e.}}\ differences between
the AST data model and that of the foreign encoding may cause some
information to be lost.  Because the AST model is extremely flexible,
however, any data loss can largely be eliminated when reading.
Instead, this effect manifests itself in the form of the above
encoding-dependent restrictions on the kind of AST Objects which may
be written.

One of the aims of the AST library, of course, is to insulate you from
the details of these foreign encodings and the restrictions they
impose. We will see shortly, therefore, how AST provides a mechanism
for determining whether your WCS information satisfies the necessary
conditions and allows you to make an automatic choice of which
encoding to use.

\subsection{\label{ss:identifyingfitsencoding}Identifying Foreign Encodings on Input}

Let us now examine the practicalities of extracting WCS information
from a set of FITS header cards which have been written by some other
software system. We will pretend that our program does not know which
encoding has been used for the WCS information and must discover this
for itself. In order to have a concrete example, however, we will use
the following set of cards. These use the FITS-WCS encoding and
contain a typical mix of other FITS cards which are irrelevant to the
WCS information in which we are interested:

\begin{quote}

DATE-END= '25/09/90'           / date of final data represented   (dd/mm/yy)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The first step is to create a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} and insert these cards into
it. If ``cards'' is an array of pointers to character strings holding
the header cards and ``ncards'' is the number of cards, this could be
done as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
#define MAXCARD 100
AstFitsChan *fitschan;
char *cards[ MAXCARD ];
int icard, ncard;

...

fitschan = astFitsChan( NULL, NULL, "" );
for ( icard = 0; icard < ncard; icard++ ) astPutFits( fitschan, cards[ icard ], 0 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note that we have not initialised the \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} attribute of the
FitsChan as we did in \secref{ss:creatingafitschan} when we wanted to
use the native encoding. This is because we are pretending not to know
which encoding to use and want AST to determine this for us. By
leaving the Encoding attribute un-set, its default value will adjust
to whichever encoding AST considers to be most appropriate, according
to the FITS header cards present. For details of how this choice is
made, see the description of the Encoding attribute in
\appref{ss:attributedescriptions}.

This approach has the obvious advantages of making our program simpler
and more flexible and of freeing us from having to know about the
different encodings available. As a bonus, it also means that the
program will be able to read any new encodings that AST may support in
future, without needing to be changed.

At this point, we could enquire the default value of the Encoding
attribute, which indicates which encoding AST intends to use, as
follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
const char *encode;

...


encode = astGetC( fitschan, "Encoding" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The result of this enquiry would be the string ``FITS-AIPS''.  Note
that we could also have set the FitsChan's Encoding attribute
explicitly, such as when creating it:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
fitschan = astFitsChan( NULL, NULL, "Encoding=FITS-AIPS" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

If we tried to read information using this encoding
(\secref{ss:readingforeignfits}), but failed, we could then change the
encoding and try again.  This would allow our program to take control
of how the optimum choice of encoding is arrived at. However, it would
also involve using explicit knowledge of the encodings available and
this is best avoided if possible.

\subsection{\label{ss:readingforeignfits}Reading Foreign WCS Information from a FITS Header}

Having stored a set of FITS header cards in a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} and determined
how the WCS information is encoded
(\secref{ss:identifyingfitsencoding}), the next step is to read an AST
\htmlref{Object}{Object} from the FitsChan using \htmlref{astRead}{astRead}. We must also remember to
rewind the FitsChan first, if necessary, such as by clearing its \htmlref{Card}{Card}
attribute, which defaults to 1:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstObject *wcsinfo;

...

astClear( fitschan, "Card" );
wcsinfo = astRead( fitschan );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

If the pointer returned by astRead is not equal to AST\_\_NULL, then
an Object has been read successfully. Otherwise, there was either no
information to read or the choice of FITS encoding
(\secref{ss:identifyingfitsencoding}) was inappropriate.

At this point you might like to indulge in a little data validation
along the lines described in \secref{ss:validatinginput}, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
if ( !strcmp( astGetC( wcsinfo, "Class" ), "FrameSet" ) ) {
   <the Object is a FrameSet, so use it>
} else {
   <something unexpected was read>
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

If a foreign encoding has definitely been used, then the Object will
automatically be a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} (\secref{ss:foreignfitslimitations}), so
this stage can be omitted. However, if the native encoding
(\secref{ss:nativeencoding}) might have been employed, which is a
possibility if you accept the FitsChan's default \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} value, then
any class of Object might have been read and a quick check would be
worthwhile.

If you used \htmlref{astShow}{astShow} (\secref{ss:displayingobjects}) to examine the
FrameSet which results from reading our example FITS header
(\secref{ss:identifyingfitsencoding}), you would find that its base
\htmlref{Frame}{Frame} describes the image's pixel coordinate system and that its
current Frame is a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} representing galactic coordinates. These
two Frames are inter-related by a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} (actually a \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap}) which
incorporates the effects of various rotations, scalings and a
``zenithal equal area'' sky projection, so that each pixel of the FITS
image is mapped on to a corresponding sky position in galactic
coordinates.

Because this FrameSet may be used both as a Mapping
(\secref{ss:framesetasmapping}) and as a Frame
(\secref{ss:framesetasframe}), it may be employed directly to perform
many useful operations without any need to decompose it into its
component parts. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Transforming data grid (FITS pixel) coordinates into galactic
coordinates and {\em{vice versa}} (\secref{ss:framesetasmapping}).

\item Formatting coordinate values (either pixel or galactic
coordinates) ready for display to a user
(\secref{ss:formattingaxisvalues} and \secref{ss:normalising}).

\item Enquiring about axis labels (or other axis
information---\secref{ss:frameattributes}) which might be used, for
example, to label columns of coordinates in a table
(\secref{ss:frameaxisattributes}).

\item Aligning the image with another image from which a similar
FrameSet has been obtained (\secref{ss:registeringimages}).

\item Creating a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} (\secref{ss:plots}), which can be used to overlay
a variety of graphical information (including a coordinate
grid---Figure~\ref{fig:gridplot}) on the displayed image.

\item Generating a new FrameSet which reflects any geometrical
processing you perform on the associated image data
(\secref{ss:wcsprocessingexample}). This new FrameSet could then be
written out as FITS headers to describe the modified image
(\secref{ss:writingforeignfits}).
\end{itemize}

If the FrameSet contains other Frames (apart from the base and current
Frames), then you would also have access to information about other
coordinate systems associated with the image.

\subsection{\label{ss:destructiveread}Removing WCS Information from FITS Headers---the Destructive Read}

It is instructive at this point to examine the contents of a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}
after we have read a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} from it
(\secref{ss:readingforeignfits}). The following would rewind our
FitsChan and display its contents:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>
char card[ 81 ];

...

astClear( fitschan, "Card" );
while ( astFindFits( fitschan, "%f", card, 1 ) ) (void) printf( "%s\n", card );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The output, if we started with the example FITS header in
\secref{ss:identifyingfitsencoding}, might look like this:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
SIMPLE  =                    T /  Written by IDL:  30-Jul-1997 05:35:42.00      
BITPIX  =                  -32 /  Bits per pixel.                               
NAXIS   =                    2 /  Number of dimensions                          
NAXIS1  =                  300 /  Length of x axis.                             
NAXIS2  =                  300 /  Length of y axis.                             
SURVEY  = 'COBE DIRBE'                                                          
BUNITS  = 'MJy/sr  '                                                            
ORIGIN  = 'CDAC    '           /  Cosmology Data Analysis Center                
TELESCOP= 'COBE    '           /  COsmic Background Explorer satellite          
INSTRUME= 'DIRBE   '           /  COBE instrument [DIRBE, DMR, FIRAS]           
PIXRESOL=                    9 /  Quad tree pixel resolution [6, 9]             
DATE    = '27/09/94'           /  FITS file creation date (dd/mm/yy)            
DATE-MAP= '16/09/94'           /  Date of original file creation (dd/mm/yy)     
COMMENT     COBE specific keywords                                              
DATE-BEG= '08/12/89'           /  date of initial data represented (dd/mm/yy)   
DATE-END= '25/09/90'           /  date of final data represented   (dd/mm/yy)   
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Comparing this with the original, you can see that all the FITS cards
that represent WCS information have been removed. They have
effectively been ``sucked out'' of the FitsChan by the destructive
read that \htmlref{astRead}{astRead} performs and converted into an equivalent
FrameSet. AST remembers where they were stored, however, so that if we
later write WCS information back into the FitsChan
(\secref{ss:writingforeignfits}) they will, as far as possible, go
back into their original locations. This helps to preserve the overall
layout of the FITS header.

You can now see why astRead performs destructive reads. It is a
mechanism for removing WCS information from a FITS header while
insulating you, as a programmer, from the details of the encoding
being used. It means you can ensure that all relevant header cards
have been removed, giving you a clean slate, without having to know
which FITS keywords any particular encoding uses.

Clearing this WCS information out of a FITS header is particularly
important when considering how to write new WCS information back after
processing (\secref{ss:writingforeignfits}). If any relevant FITS
cards are left over from the input dataset and find their way into the
new processed header, they could interfere with the new information
being written.\footnote{This can happen if a particular keyword is
present in the input header but is not used in the output header
(whether particular keywords are used can depend on the WCS
information being stored). In such a case, the original value would
not be over-written by a new output value, so would remain erroneously
present.} The destructive read mechanism ensures that this doesn't
happen.

\subsection{\label{ss:propagatingwcsinformation}Propagating WCS Information through Data Processing Steps}

One of the purposes of AST is to make it feasible to propagate WCS
information through successive stages of data processing, so that it
remains consistent with the associated image data. As far as possible,
this should happen regardless of the FITS encoding used to store the
original WCS information.

If the data processing being performed does not change the
relationship between image pixel and world coordinates (whatever these
may be), then propagation of the WCS information is
straightforward. You can simply copy the FITS header from input to
output.

If this relationship changes, however, then the WCS information must
be processed alongside the image data and a new FITS header generated
to represent it. In this case, the sequence of operations within your
program would probably be as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the image data and associated FITS header from the input
dataset, putting the header cards into a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}
(\secref{ss:identifyingfitsencoding}).

\item Read an AST \htmlref{Object}{Object}, a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, from the FitsChan (typically
using a foreign FITS encoding---\secref{ss:readingforeignfits}).

\item Process the image data and modify the FrameSet accordingly
({\em{e.g.}}~\secref{ss:wcsprocessingexample}).

\item Write the FrameSet back into the FitsChan
(\secref{ss:writingforeignfits}).

\item Perform any other modification of FITS header cards your program
may require.

\item Write the FitsChan contents ({\em{i.e.}}\ processed header
cards) and image data to the output dataset.
\end{enumerate}

In stage (2), the original WCS information will be removed from the
FitsChan by a destructive read. Later, in stage (4), new WCS
information is written to replace it. This is the process which we
consider next (\secref{ss:writingforeignfits}).

\subsection{\label{ss:writingforeignfits}Writing Foreign WCS Information to a FITS Header}

Before we can write processed WCS information held in a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} back
into a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} in preparation for output, we must select the FITS
encoding to use.  Unfortunately, we cannot simply depend on the
default value of the \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} attribute, as we did when reading the
input information (\secref{ss:identifyingfitsencoding}), because the
destructive action of reading the WCS data
(\secref{ss:destructiveread}) will have altered the FitsChan's
contents. This, in turn, will have changed the choice of default
encoding, probably causing it to revert to NATIVE.

We will return to the question of the optimum choice of encoding
below.  For now, let's assume that we want to use the same encoding
for output as we used for input. Since we enquired what that was
before we read the input WCS data from the FitsChan
(\secref{ss:identifyingfitsencoding}), we can now set that value
explicitly. We can also set the FitsChan's \htmlref{Card}{Card} attribute back to 1 at
the same time (because the write will fail if the FitsChan is not
rewound). \htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite} can then be used to write the output WCS
information into the FitsChan:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int nobj;

...

astSet( fitschan, "Card=1, Encoding=%s", encode );
nobj = astWrite( fitschan, wcsinfo );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The value returned by astWrite (assigned to ``nobj'') indicates how
many Objects were written. This will either be 1 or zero. A value of
zero is used to indicate that the information could not be encoded in
the form you requested. If this happens, nothing will have been
written.

If your choice of encoding proves inadequate, the probable reason is
that the changes you have made to the FrameSet have caused it to
depart from the data model which the encoding assumes.  AST knows
about the data model used by each encoding and will attempt to
simplify the FrameSet you provide so as to fit into that model, thus
relieving you of the need to understand the details and limitations of
each encoding yourself. When this attempt fails, however, you must
consider what alternative encoding to use.

Ideally, you would probably want to try a sequence of alternative
encodings, using an approach such as the following:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
/* 1. */
astSet( fitschan, "Card=1, Encoding=FITS-IRAF" );
if ( !astWrite( fitschan, wcsinfo ) ) {

/* 2. */
   astSetC( fitschan, "Encoding", encode );
   if ( !astWrite( fitschan, wcsinfo ) ) {

/* 3. */
      astSet( fitschan, "Encoding=NATIVE" );
      (void) astWrite( fitschan, wcsinfo );
   }
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

That is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start by trying the FITS-WCS encoding, on the grounds that FITS
should provide a universal interchange standard in which all WCS
information should be expressed if possible. 

\item If that fails, then try the original encoding used for the input
WCS information, on the grounds that you are at least not making the
information any harder for others to read than it originally was.

\item If that also fails, then you are probably trying to store fairly
complex information for which you need the native encoding. Only other
AST programs will then be able to read this information, but these are
probably the only programs that will be able to do anything sensible
with it anyway.
\end{enumerate}

An alternative approach might be to encode the WCS information in several
ways, since this gives the maximum chance that other software will be
able to read it. This approach is only possible if there is no
significant conflict between the FITS keywords used by the different
encodings\footnote{In practice, this means you should avoid mixing
FITS-IRAF, FITS-WCS, FITS-AIPS and FITS-PC encodings since they share
many keywords.}.  Adopting this approach would simply require multiple
calls to astWrite, rewinding the FitsChan and changing its Encoding value
before each one.

Unfortunately, however, there is a drawback to duplicating WCS
information in the FITS header in this way, because any program which
modifies one version of this information and simply copies the
remainder of the header will risk producing two inconsistent sets of
information. This could obviously be confusing to subsequent
software. Whether you consider this a worthwhile risk probably depends
on the use to which you expect your data to be put.

\cleardoublepage
\section{\label{ss:intramaps}Creating Your Own Private Mappings (IntraMaps)}

\subsection{The Need for Extensibility}

However many \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} classes are provided by AST, sooner or later you
will want to transform coordinates in some way that has not been
foreseen. You might want to plot a graph in some novel curvilinear
coordinate system (perhaps you already have a WCS system in your
software and just want to use AST for its graphical capabilities).
Alternatively, you might need to calibrate a complex dataset (like an
objective prism plate) where each position must be converted to world
coordinates with reference to calibration data under the control of an
elaborate algorithm.

In such cases, it is clear that the basic pre-formed components
provided by AST for building Mappings are just not enough. What you
need is access to a programming language. However, if you write your
own software to transform coordinate values, then it must be made
available in the form of an AST class (from which you can create
Objects) before it can be used in conjunction with other AST
facilities.

At this point you might consider writing your own AST class, but this
is not recommended. Not only would the internal conventions used by
AST take some time to master, but you might also find yourself having
to change your software whenever a new version of AST was
released. Fortunately, there is a much easier route provided by the
\htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap} class.

\subsection{The IntraMap Model}

To allow you to write your own Mappings, AST provides a special kind
of \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} called an \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap}. An IntraMap is a sort of ``wrapper''
for a coordinate transformation function written in C. You write this
function yourself and then register it with AST. This, in effect,
creates a new class from which you can create Mappings
({\em{i.e.}}\ IntraMaps) which will transform coordinates in whatever
way your transformation function specifies.

Because IntraMaps are Mappings, they may be used in the same way as
any other Mapping. For instance, they may be combined in series or
parallel with other Mappings using a \htmlref{CmpMap}{CmpMap} (\secref{ss:cmpmaps}),
they may be inverted (\secref{ss:invertingmappings}), you may enquire
about their attributes (\secref{ss:gettingattributes}), they may be
inserted into FrameSets (\secref{ss:framesets}), {\em{etc.}} They do,
however, have some important limitations of which you should be aware
before we go on to consider how to create them.

\subsection{\label{ss:intramaplimitations}Limitations of IntraMaps}

By now, you might be wondering why any other kind of \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} is
required at all. After all, why not simply write your own coordinate
transformation functions in C, wrap them up in IntraMaps and do away
with all the other Mapping classes in AST?

The reason is not too hard to find. Any transformation function you
write is created solely by you, so it is a private extension which
does not form a permanent part of AST. If you use it to calibrate some
data and then pass that data to someone else, who has only the
standard version of AST, then they will not be able to interpret it.

Thus, while an \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap} is fine for use by you and your collaborators
(who we assume have access to the same transformation functions), it
does not address the need for universal data exchange like other AST
Mappings do. This is where the ``Intra'' in the class name
``IntraMap'' comes from, implying private or internal usage.

For this reason, it is unwise to store IntraMaps in datasets, unless
they will be used solely for communication between collaborating items
of software which share conventions about their use.  A private
database describing coordinate systems on a graphics device might be
an example where IntraMaps would be suitable, because the data would
probably never be accessed by anyone else's software. Restricting
IntraMap usage to within a single program ({\em{i.e.}} never writing
it out) is, of course, completely safe.

If, by accident, an IntraMap should happen to escape as part of a
dataset, then the unsuspecting recipient is likely to receive an error
message when they attempt to read the data. However, AST will
associate details of the IntraMap's transformation function and its
author (if provided) with the data, so that the recipient can make an
intelligent enquiry to obtain the necessary software if this proves
essential.

\subsection{\label{ss:transformationfunctions}Writing a Transformation Function}

The first stage in creating an \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap} is to write the coordinate
transformation function. This should have a calling interface like the
\htmlref{astTranP}{astTranP} function provided by AST ({\em{q.v.}}). Here is a simple
example of a suitable transformation function which transforms
coordinates by squaring them:
\xlabel{SqrTran}

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
#include <math.h>

void SqrTran( AstMapping *this, int npoint, int ncoord_in,
              const double *ptr_in[], int forward, int ncoord_out,
              double *ptr_out[] ) {
   int point, coord;
   double x;

/* Forward transformation. */
   if ( forward ) {
      for ( point = 0; point < npoint; point++ ) {
         for ( coord = 0; coord < ncoord_in; coord++ ) {
            x = ptr_in[ coord ][ point ];
            ptr_out[ coord ][ point ] = ( x == AST__BAD ) ? AST__BAD : x * x;
         }
      }

/* Inverse transformation. */
   } else {
      for ( point = 0; point < npoint; point++ ) {
         for ( coord = 0; coord < ncoord_in; coord++ ) {
            x = ptr_in[ coord ][ point ];
            ptr_out[ coord ][ point ] =
               ( x < 0.0 || x == AST__BAD ) ? AST__BAD : sqrt( x );
         }
      }
   }
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

As you can see, the function comes in two halves which implement the
forward and inverse coordinate transformations. The number of points
to be transformed (``npoint'') and the numbers of input and output
coordinates per point (``ncoord\_in'' and ``ncoord\_out''---in this
case both are assumed equal) are passed to the function. A pair of
loops then accesses all the coordinate values.  Note that it is
legitimate to omit one or other of the forward/inverse transformations
and simply not to implement it, if it will not be required. It is also
permissible to require that the numbers of input and output
coordinates be fixed ({\em{e.g.}}\ at 2), or to write the function so
that it can handle arbitrary dimensionality, as here.

Before using an incoming coordinate, the function must first check
that it is not set to the value AST\_\_BAD, which indicates missing
data (\secref{ss:badcoordinates}). If it is, the same value is also
assigned to any affected output coordinates. The value AST\_\_BAD is
also generated if any coordinates cannot be transformed. In this
example, this can happen with the inverse transformation if negative
values are encountered, so that the square root cannot be taken.

There are very few restrictions on what a coordinate transformation
function may do. For example, it may freely perform I/O to access any
external data needed, it may invoke other AST facilities (but beware
of unwanted recursion), {\em{etc.}} Typically, you may also want to
pass information to it {\em{via}}\ global variables. Remember,
however, that whatever facilities the transformation function requires
must be available in every program which uses it.

Generally, it is not a good idea to retain context information within
a transformation function. That is, it should transform each set of
coordinates as a single point and retain no memory of the points it
has transformed before. This is in order to conform with the AST model
of a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}.

If an error occurs within a transformation function, it should use the
\htmlref{astSetStatus}{astSetStatus} function (\secref{ss:errordetection}) to set the AST
status to an error value before returning. This will alert AST to the
error, causing it to abort the current operation. The error value
AST\_\_ITFER is available for this purpose, but other values may also
be used ({\em{e.g.}}\ if you wish to distinguish different types of
error).

\subsection{\label{ss:registeringintramaps}Registering a Transformation Function}

Having written your coordinate transformation function, the next step
is to register it with AST. Registration is performed using
\htmlref{astIntraReg}{astIntraReg}, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
void SqrTran( AstMapping *, int, int, const double *[], int, int, double *[] );

const char *author, *contact, *purpose;

...

purpose = "Square each coordinate value";
author =  "R.F. Warren-Smith & D.S. Berry";
contact = "http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/?xref_SqrTran";

astIntraReg( "SqrTran", 2, 2, SqrTran, 0, purpose, author, contact );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note that you should also provide a function prototype to describe the
transformation function (the implementation of the function itself
would suffice, of course).

The first argument to astIntraReg is a name by which the
transformation function will be known. This will be used when we come
to create an \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap} and is case sensitive. We recommend that you use
the actual function name here and make this sufficiently unusual that
it is unlikely to clash with any other functions in most people's
software.

The next two arguments specify the number of input and output
coordinates which the transformation function will handle. These
correspond with the \htmlref{Nin}{Nin} and \htmlref{Nout}{Nout} attributes of the IntraMap we will
create. Here, we have set them both to 2, which means that we will
only be able to create IntraMaps with 2 input and 2 output coordinates
(despite the fact that the transformation function can actually handle
other dimensionalities). We will see later
(\secref{ss:variableintramapcoordinates}) how to remove this
restriction.

The fourth argument should contain a set of flags which describe the
transformation function in a little more detail. We will return to
this shortly (\secref{ss:restrictedintramaps} \&
\secref{ss:simplifyingintramaps}). For now, we supply a value of zero.

The remaining arguments are character strings which document the
transformation function, mainly for the benefit of anyone who is
unfortunate enough to encounter a reference to it in their data which
they cannot interpret. As explained above
(\secref{ss:intramaplimitations}), you should try and avoid this, but
accidents will happen, so you should always provide strings containing
the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A short description of what the transformation function is for.
\item The name of the author.
\item Contact details, such as an e-mail or WWW address.
\end{enumerate}

The idea is that anyone finding an IntraMap in their data, but lacking
the necessary transformation function, should be able to contact the
author and make a sensible enquiry in order to obtain it. If you
expect many enquiries, you may like to set up a World Wide Web page
and use that instead (in the example above, we use the WWW address of
the relevant part of this document).

\subsection{Creating an IntraMap}

Once a transformation function has been registered, creating an
\htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap} from it is simple:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstIntraMap *intramap;

...

intramap = astIntraMap( "SqrTran", 2, 2, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

We simply use the \htmlref{astIntraMap}{astIntraMap} constructor function and pass it the
name of the transformation function to use. This name is the same
(case sensitive) one that we associated with the function when we
registered it using \htmlref{astIntraReg}{astIntraReg} (\secref{ss:registeringintramaps}).

You can, of course, register any number of transformation functions
and select which one to use whenever you create an IntraMap. You can
also create any number of independent IntraMaps using each
transformation function. In this sense, each transformation function
you register effectively creates a new ``sub-class'' of IntraMap, from
which you can create Objects just like any other class. However, an
error will occur if you attempt to use a transformation function that
has not yet been registered.

The second and third arguments to astIntraMap are the numbers of input
and output coordinates. These define the \htmlref{Nin}{Nin} and \htmlref{Nout}{Nout} attributes for
the IntraMap that is created and they must match the corresponding
numbers given when the transformation function was registered.

The final argument is the usual attribute initialisation string. You
may set attribute values for an IntraMap in exactly the same way as
for any other \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} (\secref{ss:settingattributes}, and also see
\secref{ss:intraflag}).

\subsection{\label{ss:restrictedintramaps}Restricted Implementations of Transformation Functions}

You may not always want to use both the forward and inverse
transformations when you create an \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap}, so it is possible to omit
either from the underlying coordinate transformation
function. Consider the following, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
void Poly3Tran( AstMapping *this, int npoint, int ncoord_in,
                const double *ptr_in[], int forward, int ncoord_out,
                double *ptr_out[] ) {
   double x;
   int point;

/* Forward transformation. */
   for ( point = 0; point < npoint; point++ ) {
      x = ptr_in[ 0 ][ point ];
      ptr_out[ 0 ][ point ] = ( x == AST__BAD ) ? AST__BAD :
         6.18 + x * ( 0.12 + x * ( -0.003 + x * 0.0000101 ) );
   }
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This implements a 1-dimensional cubic polynomial transformation. Since
this is somewhat awkward to invert, however, we have only implemented
the forward transformation.  When registering the function, this is
indicated via the ``flags'' argument to \htmlref{astIntraReg}{astIntraReg}, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
void Poly3Tran( AstMapping *, int, int, const double *[], int, int, double *[] );

...

astIntraReg( "Poly3Tran", 1, 1, Poly3Tran, AST__NOINV,
             purpose, author, contact );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, the fifth argument has been set to the flag value AST\_\_NOINV
to indicate the lack of an inverse. If the forward transformation were
absent, we would use AST\_\_NOFOR instead. Flag values for this
argument may be combined using a bitwise OR if necessary.

\subsection{\label{ss:variableintramapcoordinates}Variable Numbers of Coordinates}

In our earlier examples, we have used a fixed number of input and
output coordinates when registering a coordinate transformation
function. It is not necessary to impose this restriction, however, if
the transformation function can cope with a variable number of
coordinates (as with the example in
\secref{ss:transformationfunctions}). We indicate the acceptability of
a variable number when registering the transformation function by
supplying the value AST\_\_ANY for the number of input and/or output
coordinates, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astIntraReg( "SqrTran", AST__ANY, AST__ANY, SqrTran, 0,
             purpose, author, contact );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The result is that an \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap} may now be created with any number of
input and output coordinates. For example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
AstIntraMap *intramap1, *intramap2;

...

intramap1 = astIntraMap( "SqrTran", 1, 1, "" );
intramap2 = astIntraMap( "SqrTran", 3, 3, "Invert=1" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

It is possible to fix either the number of input or output coordinates
(by supplying an explicit number to \htmlref{astIntraReg}{astIntraReg}), but more subtle
restrictions on the number of coordinates, such as requiring that \htmlref{Nin}{Nin}
and \htmlref{Nout}{Nout} be equal, are not supported. This means that:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
intramap = astIntraMap( "SqrTran", 1, 2, "" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

will be accepted without error, although the transformation function
cannot actually handle such a combination sensibly. If this is
important, it would be worth adding a check within the transformation
function itself, so that the error would be detected when it came to
be used.

\subsection{\label{ss:intraflag}Adapting a Transformation Function to Individual IntraMaps}

In the examples given so far, our coordinate transformation functions
have not made use of the ``this'' pointer passed to them (which
identifies the \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap} whose transformation we are implementing). In
practice, this will often be the case. However, the presence of the
``this'' pointer allows the transformation function to invoke any
other AST function on the IntraMap, and this permits enquiries about
its attributes. The transformation function's behaviour can therefore
be modified according to any attribute values which are set. This
turns out to be a useful thing to do, so each IntraMap has a special
\htmlref{IntraFlag}{IntraFlag} attribute reserved for exactly this purpose.

Consider, for instance, the case where the transformation function has
access to several alternative sets of internally-stored data which it
may apply to perform its transformation. Rather than implement many
different versions of the transformation function, you may switch
between them by setting a value for the IntraFlag attribute when you
create an instance of an IntraMap, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
intramap1 = astIntraMap( "MyTran", 2, 2, "IntraFlag=A" );
intramap2 = astIntraMap( "MyTran", 2, 2, "IntraFlag=B" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

The transformation function may then enquire the value of the IntraFlag
attribute ({\em{e.g.}}\ using astGetC and passing it the ``this''
pointer) and use whichever dataset is required for that particular
IntraMap.

This approach is particularly useful when the number of possible
transformations is unbounded or not known in advance, in which case
the IntraFlag attribute may be used to hold numerical values encoded
as part of a character string (effectively using them as data for the
IntraMap). It is also superior to the use of a global switch for
communication ({\em{e.g.}}\ setting an index to select the ``current''
data before using the IntraMap), because it continues to work when
several IntraMaps are embedded within a more complex compound \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping},
when you may have no control over the order in which they are used.

\subsection{\xlabel{MaxTran}\label{ss:simplifyingintramaps}Simplifying IntraMaps}

A notable disadvantage of IntraMaps is that they are ``black boxes''
as far as AST is concerned. This means that they have limited ability
to participate in the simplification of compound Mappings performed,
{\em{e.g.}}, by \htmlref{astSimplify}{astSimplify} (\secref{ss:simplifyingcmpmaps}), because
AST cannot know how they interact with other Mappings. In reality, of
course, they will often implement such specialised coordinate
transformations that the simplification possibilities will be rather
limited anyway.

One important simplification, however, is the ability of a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} to
cancel with its own inverse to yield a unit Mapping (a \htmlref{UnitMap}{UnitMap}). This
is important because Mappings are frequently used to relate a dataset
to some external standard (a celestial coordinate system, for
example). When inter-relating two similar datasets calibrated using
the same standard, part of the Mapping often cancels, because it is
applied first in one direction and then the other, effectively
eliminating the reference to the standard. This is often a useful
simplification and can lead to greater efficiency.

Many transformations have this property of cancelling with their own
inverse, but not necessarily all. Consider the following
transformation function, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
void MaxTran( AstMapping *this, int npoint, int ncoord_in,
              const double *ptr_in[], int forward, int ncoord_out,
              double *ptr_out[] ) {
   double hi, x;
   int coord, point;

/* Forward transformation. */
   if ( forward ) {
      for ( point = 0; point < npoint; point++ ) {
         hi = AST__BAD;
         for ( coord = 0; coord < ncoord_in; coord++ ) {
            x = ptr_in[ coord ][ point ];
            if ( x != AST__BAD ) {
               if ( x > hi || hi == AST__BAD ) hi = x;
            }
         }
         ptr_out[ 0 ][ point ] = hi;
      }

/* Inverse transformation. */
   } else {
      for ( coord = 0; coord < ncoord_out; coord++ ) {
         for ( point = 0; point < npoint; point++ ) {
            ptr_out[ coord ][ point ] = ptr_in[ 0 ][ point ];
         }
      }      
   }
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This function takes any number of input coordinates and returns a
single output coordinate which is the maximum value of the input
coordinates. Its inverse (actually a ``pseudo-inverse'') sets all the
input coordinates to the value of the output
coordinate.\footnote{Remember that ``ptr\_in'' identifies the original
``output'' coordinates when applying the inverse transformation and
``ptr\_out'' identifies the original ``input'' coordinates.}

If this function is applied in the forward direction and then in the
inverse direction, it does {\bf{not}} in general restore the original
coordinate values. However, if applied in the inverse direction and
then the forward direction, it does. Hence, replacing the sequence of
operations with an equivalent UnitMap is possible in the latter case,
but not in the former.

To distinguish these possibilities, two flag values are provided for
use with \htmlref{astIntraReg}{astIntraReg} to indicate what simplification (if any) is
possible. For example, to register the above transformation function,
we might use:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
void MaxTran( AstMapping *, int, int, const double *[], int, int, double *[] );

...

astIntraReg( "MaxTran", AST__ANY, 1, MaxTran, AST__SIMPIF,
             purpose, author, contact );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, the flag value AST\_\_SIMPIF supplied for the fifth argument
indicates that simplification is possible if the transformation is
applied in the inverse direction followed by the forward direction. To
indicate the complementary case, the flag AST\_\_SIMPFI would be used
instead. If both simplifications are possible (as with the SqrTran
function in \secref{ss:transformationfunctions}), then we would use
the bitwise OR of both values.

In practice, some judgement is usually necessary when deciding whether
to allow simplification. For example, seen in one light our SqrTran
function (\secref{ss:transformationfunctions}) does not cancel with
its own inverse, because squaring a coordinate value and then taking
its square root can change the original value, if this was
negative. Therefore, replacing this combination with a UnitMap will
change the behaviour of a compound Mapping and should not be
allowed. Seen in another light, however, where the coordinates being
processed are intrinsically all positive, it is a permissible and
probably useful simplification.

If such distinctions are ever important in practice, it is simple to
register the same transformation function twice with different flag
values (use a separate name for each) and then use whichever is
appropriate when creating an \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap}.

\subsection{\label{ss:readingandwritingintramaps}Writing and Reading IntraMaps}

It is most important to realise that when you write an \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap} to a
\htmlref{Channel}{Channel} (\secref{ss:writingtoachannel}), the transformation function
which it uses is not stored with it. To do so is impossible, because
the function has been compiled and loaded into memory ready for
execution before AST gets to see it. However, AST does store the name
associated with the transformation function and various details about
the IntraMap itself.


This means that any program attempting to read the IntraMap
(\secref{ss:readingfromachannel}) cannot make use of it unless it also
has independent access to the original transformation function. If it
does not have access to this function, an error will occur at the
point where the IntraMap is read and the associated error message will
direct the user to the author of the transformation function for more
information.

However, if the necessary transformation function is available, and
has been registered before the read operation takes place, then AST is
able to re-create the original IntraMap and will do so. Registration
of the transformation function must, of course, use the same name
(and, in fact, be identical in most particulars) as was used in the
original program which wrote the data.

This means that a set of co-operating programs which all have access
to the same set of transformation functions and register them in
identical fashion (see \secref{ss:intramaplibrary} for how this can
best be achieved) can freely exchange data that contain IntraMaps. The
need to avoid exporting such data to unsuspecting third parties
(\secref{ss:intramaplimitations}) must, however, be re-iterated.

\subsection{\label{ss:intramaplibrary}Managing Transformation Functions in Libraries}

If you are developing a large suite of data reduction software, you
may have a need to use IntraMaps at various points within it. Very
probably this will occur in unrelated modules which are compiled
separately and then stored in a library. Since the transformation
functions required must be registered before they can be used, this
makes it difficult to decide where to perform this registration,
especially since any particular data reduction program may use an
arbitrary subset of the modules in your library.

To assist with this problem, AST allows you to perform the same
registration of a transformation function any number of times, so long
as it is performed using an identical invocation of \htmlref{astIntraReg}{astIntraReg} on
each occasion ({\em{i.e.}}\ all of its arguments must be
identical). This means you do not have to keep track of whether a
particular function has already been registered but could, in fact,
register it on each occasion immediately before it is required
(wherever that may be). In order that all registrations are identical,
however, it is recommended that you group them all together into a
single function, perhaps as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
void MyTrans( void ) {

   ...

   astIntraReg( "MaxTran", AST__ANY, 1, MaxTran, AST__SIMPIF,
                purpose, author, contact );

   ...

   astIntraReg( "Poly3Tran", 1, 1, Poly3Tran, AST__NOINV,
                purpose, author, contact );

   ...

   astIntraReg( "SqrTran", 2, 2, SqrTran, 0,
                purpose, author, contact );
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

You can then simply invoke this function wherever necessary. It is, in
fact, particularly important to register all relevant transformation
functions in this way before you attempt to read an \htmlref{Object}{Object} that might
be (or contain) an \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap}
(\secref{ss:readingandwritingintramaps}). This is because you may not
know in advance which of these transformation functions the IntraMap
will use, so they must all be available in order to avoid an error.

\cleardoublepage
\section{\label{ss:plots}Producing Graphical Output (Plots)}

Graphical output from AST is performed though an \htmlref{Object}{Object} called a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot},
which is a specialised form of \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}. A Plot does not represent the
graphical content itself, but is a route through which plotting
operations, such as drawing lines and curves, are conveyed on to a
plotting surface to appear as visible graphics.

\subsection{The Plot Model}

When a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} is created, it is initialised by providing a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}
whose base \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} (as specified by its \htmlref{Base}{Base} attribute) is mapped
linearly on to a {\em{plotting area.}} This is a rectangular region in
the graphical coordinate space of the underlying graphics system and
becomes the new base Frame of the Plot. In effect, the Plot becomes
attached to the plotting surface, in rather the same way that a basic
FrameSet might be attached to (say) an image.

The current Frame of the Plot (derived from the current Frame of the
FrameSet supplied) is used to represent a {\em{physical coordinate
system.}} This is the system in which plotting operations are
performed by your program.  Every plotting operation is then
transformed through the \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which inter-relates the Plot's current
and base Frames in order to appear on the plotting surface.

An example may help here. Suppose we start with a FrameSet whose base
Frame describes the pixel coordinates of an image and whose current
Frame describes a celestial (equatorial) coordinate system. Let us
assume that these two Frames are inter-related by a Mapping within the
FrameSet which represents a particular sky projection.

When a Plot is created from this FrameSet, we specify how the pixel
coordinates (the base Frame) maps on to the plotting surface. This
simply corresponds to telling the Plot where we have previously
plotted the image data. If we now use the Plot to plot a line with
latitude zero in our physical coordinate system, as given by the
current Frame, this line would appear as a curve (the equator) on the
plotting surface, correctly registered with the image.

There are a number of plotting functions provided, which all work in a
similar way. Plotting operations are transformed through the Mapping
which the Plot represents before they appear on the plotting
surface.\footnote{Like any FrameSet, a Plot can be used as a
Mapping. In this case it is the inverse transformation which is used
when plotting ({\em{i.e.}}\ that which transforms between the current
and base Frames).}  It is possible to draw symbols, lines, axes,
entire grids and more in this way.

%\subsection{TBW---Creating a Plot}

\subsection{Plotting Symbols}

The simplest form of plotting is to draw symbols (termed
{\em{markers}}) at a set of points. This is performed by \htmlref{astMark}{astMark},
which is supplied with a set of physical coordinates at which to place
the markers:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
#define NCOORD 2
#define NMARK 10
double in[ NCOORD ][ NMARK ];
int type;

...

astMark( plot, NMARK, NCOORD, NMARK, in, type );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, NMARK specifies how many markers to plot and NCOORD specifies
how many coordinates are being supplied for each
point.\footnote{Remember, the physical coordinate space need not
necessarily be 2-dimensional, even if the plotting surface is.} The
array ``in'' supplies the coordinates and the integer ``type''
specifies which type of marker to plot.

\subsection{\label{ss:plottinggeodesics}Plotting Geodesic Curves}

There is no \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} routine to draw a straight line, because any straight
line in physical coordinates can potentially turn into a curve in
graphical coordinates. We therefore start by considering how to draw
geodesic curves.  These are curves which trace the path of shortest
distance between two points in physical coordinates
 and are the basic drawing element in a Plot. 

In many instances, the geodesic will, in fact, be a straight line, but
this depends on the Plot's current \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}. If this represents a
celestial coordinate system, for instance, it will be a great circle
(corresponding with the behaviour of the \htmlref{astDistance}{astDistance} function which
defines the metric of the physical coordinate space).  The geodesic
will, of course, be transformed into graphics coordinates before being
plotted. A geodesic curve is plotted using \htmlref{astCurve}{astCurve} as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
double start[ NCOORD ], finish[ NCOORD ];

...

astCurve( plot, start, finish );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, ``start'' and ``finish'' are arrays containing the starting and
finishing coordinates of the curve. The \htmlref{astOffset}{astOffset} and astDistance
functions can often be useful for computing these
(\secref{ss:distanceandoffset}).

If you need to draw a series of curves end-to-end (when drawing a
contour line, for example), then a more efficient alternative is to
use \htmlref{astPolyCurve}{astPolyCurve}. This has the same effect as a sequence of
invocations of astCurve, but allows you to supply a whole set of
points at one time. astPolyCurve then joins them, in sequence, using
geodesic curves:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#define NPOINT 100
double coords[ NCOORD ][ NPOINT ];

...

astPolyCurve( plot, NPOINT, NCOORD, NPOINT, coords );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, NPOINT specifies how many points are to be joined and NCOORD
specifies how many coordinates are being supplied for each point.  The
array ``coords'' supplies the coordinates of the points in the Plot's
physical coordinate system.

\subsection{Plotting Curves Parallel to Axes}

As there is no \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} function to draw a ``straight line'', drawing axes
and grid lines to represent coordinate systems requires a slightly
different approach. The problem is that for some coordinate systems,
these grid lines will not be geodesics, so \htmlref{astCurve}{astCurve} and \htmlref{astPolyCurve}{astPolyCurve}
(\secref{ss:plottinggeodesics}) cannot easily be used (you would have
to resort to approximating grid lines by many small elements). Lines
of constant celestial latitude provide an example of this, with the
exception of the equator which is a geodesic.

The \htmlref{astGridLine}{astGridLine} function allows these curves to be drawn, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int axis;
double length;

...

astGridLine( plot, axis, start, length );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, ``axis'' specifies which physical coordinate axis we wish to
draw parallel to. The ``start'' array contains the coordinates of the
start of the curve and ``length'' specifies the distance to draw along
the axis in physical coordinate space.

\subsection{\label{ss:clipping}Clipping}

Like many graphics systems, a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} allows you to {\em{clip}} the graphics
you produce. This means that plotting is restricted to certain regions
of the plotting surface so that anything drawn outside these regions
will not appear.  All Plots automatically clip at the edges of the
plotting area specified when the Plot is created. This means that
graphics are ultimately restricted to the rectangular region of
plotting space to which you have attached the Plot.

In addition to this, you may also specify lower and upper limits on
each axis at which clipping should occur. This permits you to further
restrict the plotting region. Moreover, you may attach these clipping
limits to {\em{any}} of the Frames in the Plot. This allows you to
place restrictions on where plotting will take place in either the
physical coordinate system, the graphical coordinate system, or in any
other coordinate system which is described by a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} within the Plot.

For example, you could plot using equatorial coordinates and set up
clipping limits in galactic coordinates. In general, you could set up
arbitrary clipping regions by adding a new Frame to a Plot (in which
clipping will be performed) and inter-relating this to the other
Frames in a suitable way.

Clipping limits are defined using the \htmlref{astClip}{astClip} function, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#define NAXES 2
int iframe;
double lbnd[ NAXES ], ubnd[ NAXES ];

...
astClip( plot, iframe, lbnd, ubnd);
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, the ``iframe'' value gives the index of the Frame within the
Plot to which clipping is to be applied, while ``lbnd'' and ``ubnd''
give the limits on each axis of the selected Frame (NAXES is the
number of axes in this Frame).

You can remove clipping by giving a value of AST\_\_NOFRAME for ``iframe''.

\subsection{Using a Plot as a Mapping}

All Plots are also Mappings (just like the FrameSets from which they
are derived), so can be used to transform coordinates.

Like FrameSets, the forward transformation of a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} will convert
coordinates between the base and current Frames ({\em{i.e.}}\ between
graphical and physical coordinates). This would be useful if you were
(say) reading a cursor position in graphical coordinates and needed to
convert this into physical coordinates for display.

Conversely, a Plot's inverse transformation converts between its
current and base Frames ({\em{i.e.}}\ from physical coordinates to
graphical coordinates). This transformation is applied automatically
whenever plotting operations are carried out by AST functions. It may
also be useful to apply it directly, however, if you wish to perform
additional plotting operations ({\em{e.g.}}\ those provided by the
native graphics system) at positions specified in physical
coordinates.

There is, however, one important difference between using a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}
and a Plot to transform coordinates, and this is that clipping may be
applied by a Plot (if it has been enabled using
\htmlref{astClip}{astClip}---\secref{ss:clipping}). Any point which lies within the
clipped region of a Plot will, when transformed, yield coordinates
with the value AST\_\_BAD. If you wish to avoid this clipping, you
should extract the relevant \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} from the Plot (using
\htmlref{astGetMapping}{astGetMapping}) and use this, instead of the Plot, to transform the
coordinates.

\subsection{Using a Plot as a Frame}

Every \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} is also a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}, so can be used to obtain the values of
Frame attributes such as a \htmlref{Title}{Title}, axis Labels, axis Units,
{\em{etc.,}} which are typically used when displaying data and/or
coordinates. These attributes are, as for any \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, derived from
the current Frame of the Plot (\secref{ss:framesetasframe}). They are
also used automatically when using the Plot to plot coordinate axes
and coordinate grids ({\em{e.g.}}\ for labelling
them---\secref{ss:plottingagrid}).

Because the current Frame of a Plot represents physical coordinates,
any Frame operation applied to the Plot will effectively be working in
this coordinate system. For example, the \htmlref{astDistance}{astDistance} and \htmlref{astOffset}{astOffset}
functions will compute distances and offsets in physical coordinate
space, while \htmlref{astFormat}{astFormat} and \htmlref{astNorm}{astNorm} will format physical coordinates in
an appropriate way for display.

\subsection{\label{ss:validphysicalcoordinates}Regions of Valid Physical Coordinates}

When points in physical coordinate space are transformed by a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot}
into graphics coordinates for plotting, they may not always yield
valid coordinates, irrespective of any clipping being applied
(\secref{ss:clipping}). To indicate this, the resulting coordinate
values will be set to the value AST\_\_BAD
(\secref{ss:badcoordinates}).

There are a number of reasons why this may occur, but typically it
will be because physical coordinates only map on to a subset of the
graphics coordinate space. This situation is commonly encountered with
all-sky projections where, typically, the celestial sphere appears,
when plotted, as a distorted shape ({\em{e.g.}}\ an ellipse) which
does not entirely fill the graphics space. In some cases, there may
even be multiple regions of valid and invalid physical coordinates.

When plotting is performed {\em{via}} a Plot, graphical output will
only appear in the regions of valid physical coordinates. Nothing will
appear where invalid coordinates occur. Such output is effectively
clipped. If you wish to plot in these areas, you must change
coordinate system and use, say, graphical coordinates to address the
plotting surface directly.

\subsection{Plotting Borders}

The \htmlref{astBorder}{astBorder} function is provided to draw a (line) border around your
graphical output. With most graphics systems, this would simply be a
rectangular box around the plotting area. With a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot}, however, this
boundary follows the edge of each region containing valid, unclipped
physical coordinates (\secref{ss:validphysicalcoordinates}).

This means, for example, that if you were plotting an all-sky
projection, this boundary would outline the perimeter of the celestial
sphere when projected on to your plotting surface. Of course, if there
is no clipping and all physical coordinates are valid, then you will
get the traditional rectangular box. astBorder requires only
a pointer to the Plot:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
int holes;

...

holes = astBorder( plot );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

It returns a boolean (integer) value to indicate if any invalid or
clipped physical coordinates were found within the plotting area. If
they were, it will draw around the valid unclipped regions and return
a value of one.  Otherwise, it will draw a simple rectangular border
and return zero.

\subsection{Plotting Text}

Using a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} to draw text involves supplying a string of text to be
displayed and a position in physical coordinates where the text is to
appear. The position is transformed into graphical coordinates to
determine where the text should appear on the plotting surface. You
must also provide a 2-element ``up'' vector which gives the upward
direction of the text in graphical coordinates. This allows text to be
drawn at any angle.

Plotting is performed by \htmlref{astText}{astText}, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
char text[ 21 ];
double pos[ NCOORD ];
float up[ 2 ] = { 0.0f, 1.0f };

...

astText( plot, text, pos, up, "TL" );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Here, ``text'' contains the string to be drawn, ``pos'' is an array of
physical coordinates and ``up'' specifies the upward vector. In this
case, the text will be drawn horizontally. The final argument
specifies the text justification, here indicating that the top left
corner of the text should appear at the position given.

Further control over the appearance of the text is possible by setting
values for various Plot attributes, for example Colour, Font and Size.

\subsection{\label{ss:plottingagrid}Plotting a Grid}

The most comprehensive plotting function available is \htmlref{astGrid}{astGrid}, which
can be used to draw labelled coordinate axes and, optionally, to
overlay coordinate grids on the plotting area
(Figure~\ref{fig:gridplot}). The routine is straightforward to use,
simply requiring a pointer to the \htmlref{Plot}{Plot}:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
astGrid( plot );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

It will draw both linear and curvilinear axes and grids, as required
by the particular Plot. The appearance of the output can be modified
in a wide variety of ways by setting various Plot attributes.

\section{Compiling and Linking Software that Uses AST}

A small number of UNIX commands are provided by AST to assist with the
process of building software. A description of these can be found in
\appref{ss:commanddescriptions} and their use is discussed here.  Note
that in order to access these commands, the appropriate directory
(normally ``/star/bin'') should be on your PATH.\footnote{If you have
not installed AST in the usual location, then substitute the
appropriate directory in place of ``/star'' wherever it occurs.}

\subsection{\label{ss:accessingheaderfile}Accessing the ``ast.h'' Header File}

Before compiling software which uses AST facilities, you may like to
``log in'' for AST software development with the following command:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
ast_dev
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This will create links in your current directory which refer to the
AST include files (for both Fortran and C).
You may then refer to the ``ast.h'' header file without having to know
where it actually resides, for example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#include "ast.h"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This file defines the external interface to the AST library, including
all constants, function prototypes, macros, {\em{etc.}}
The links created by ``\htmlref{ast\_dev}{ast_dev}'' will persist, but may be removed at
any time, either explicitly or with the command:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
ast_dev remove
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

If you do not log in in this way, then the ``ast.h'' header file
should be located using the usual compiler options for finding C
include files, for instance:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
cc prog.c -I/star/include -o prog
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

This is preferable to specifying the file's absolute name within your
software.

\subsection{\label{ss:linking}Linking with AST Facilities}

C programs which use AST facilities may be linked by including
execution of the command ``\htmlref{ast\_link}{ast_link}'' on the compiler command
line. Thus, to compile and link a program called ``prog'', the
following might be used:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
cc prog.c -L/star/lib `ast_link` -o prog
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note the use of backward quote characters, which cause the
``ast\_link'' command to be executed and its result substituted into
the compiler command. An alternative is to save the output from
``ast\_link'' in (say) a shell variable and use this instead. You may
find this a little faster if you are building software repeatedly
during development.

Programs which use AST can also be linked in a number of other ways,
depending on the facilities they require. In the example above, we
have used the default method which assumes that the program will not
be generating graphical output, so that no graphics libraries need be
linked. If you need other facilities, then various switches can be
applied to the ``ast\_link'' command in order to control the linking
process.

For example, if you were producing graphical output using the PGPLOT
graphics package, you could link with the AST/PGPLOT interface by
using the ``$-$pgplot'' switch with ``ast\_link'', as
follows:\footnote{Use the ``$-$pgp'' option instead if you wish to use
the Starlink version of PGPLOT which uses GKS to generate its output.}

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
cc prog.c -L/star/lib `ast_link -pgplot` -o prog
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

See the ``ast\_link'' command description in
\appref{ss:commanddescriptions} for details of the options available.

\subsection{Building ADAM Applications that Use AST}

Users of Starlink's \xref{ADAM}{sg4}{} programming environment
\latexonly{(SG/4)} on UNIX should use the
``\xref{alink}{sun144}{ADAM_link_scripts}'' command
(\xref{SUN/144}{sun144}{}) to compile and link applications and can
access the AST library by including execution of the command
``\htmlref{ast\_link\_adam}{ast_link_adam}'' on the command line, as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
alink adamprog.c `ast_link_adam`
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\end{quote}

Note the use of backward quote characters.

By default, AST error messages produced by applications built in this
way will be delivered {\em{via}} the Starlink EMS Error Message
Service (\xref{SSN/4}{ssn4}{}) so that error handling by AST is
consistent with the \xref{{\em{inherited
status}}}{sun104}{inherited_status} error handling normally used in
Starlink software.

Switches may be given to the ``ast\_link\_adam'' command (in a similar
way to ``\htmlref{ast\_link}{ast_link}''---\secref{ss:linking}) in order to link with
additional AST-related facilities, such as a graphics interface. See
the ``ast\_link\_adam'' command description in
\appref{ss:commanddescriptions} for details of the options available.

         number of output coordinate values generated by this Mapping

         As a special case, if a pointer to a FrameSet is given for the
         {\tt{"}}frame{\tt{"}} parameter, this is treated as a request to merge a pair of

         {\tt{"}}frame{\tt{"}} FrameSet) to the original FrameSet, while preserving
         their order and retaining all the inter-relationships
         (i.e. Mappings) between them. The two sets of Frames are
         inter-related within the merged FrameSet by using the Mapping
         supplied. This should convert between the Frame identified by
         the {\tt{"}}iframe{\tt{"}} parameter (in the original FrameSet) and the current
         Frame of the {\tt{"}}frame{\tt{"}} FrameSet. This latter Frame becomes the
         current Frame in the merged FrameSet.

         \sstitem
         The clipping produced by this function is in addition to that
         which always occurs at the edges of the plotting area
         established when the Plot is created (see \htmlref{astPlot}{astPlot}). The
         underlying graphics system may also impose further clipping.

         \sstitem
         When testing a graphical position for clipping, it is first
         transformed into the clipping Frame. The resulting coordinate on
         each axis is then checked against the clipping limits (given by
         {\tt{"}}lbnd{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}ubnd{\tt{"}}). By default, a position is clipped if any
         coordinate lies outside these limits. However, if a non-zero
         value is assigned to the Plot's \htmlref{ClipOp}{ClipOp} attribute, then a
         position is only clipped if the coordinates on all axes lie
         outside their clipping limits.

         \sstitem
         If the lower clipping limit exceeds the upper limit for any
         axis, then the sense of clipping for that axis is reversed (so
         that coordinate values lying between the limits are clipped
         instead of those lying outside the limits). To produce a {\tt{"}}hole{\tt{"}}
         in a coordinate space (that is, an internal region where nothing
         is plotted), you should supply all the bounds in reversed order,
         and set the ClipOp attribute for the Plot to a non-zero value.

         \sstitem
         Either clipping limit may be set to the value AST\_\_BAD, which
         is equivalent to setting it to infinity (or minus infinity for a
         lower bound) so that it is not used.

         \sstitem
         If a graphical position results in any bad coordinate values
         (AST\_\_BAD) when transformed into the clipping Frame, then it is
         treated (for the purposes of producing graphical output) as if
         it were clipped.

   Determine how to convert between two coordinate systems
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This function compares two Frames and determines whether it is
      possible to convert between the coordinate systems which they
      represent. If conversion is possible, it returns a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}
      which describes the conversion and which may be used (as a
      \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}) to transform coordinate values in either direction.

      The same function may also be used to determine how to convert
      between two FrameSets (or between a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} and a FrameSet, or
      vice versa). This mode is intended for use when (for example)
      two images have been calibrated by attaching a FrameSet to each.
      astConvert might then be used to search for a
      celestial coordinate system that both images have in common, and
      the result could then be used to convert between the pixel
      coordinates of both images -- having effectively used their
      celestial coordinate systems to align them.

      When using FrameSets, there may be more than one possible
      intermediate coordinate system in which to perform the
      conversion (for instance, two FrameSets might both have
      celestial coordinates, detector coordinates, pixel coordinates,
      etc.). A comma-separated list of coordinate system domains may
      therefore be given which defines a priority order to use when
      selecting the intermediate coordinate system.  The path used for
      conversion must go via an intermediate coordinate system whose
      \htmlref{Domain}{Domain} attribute matches one of the domains given. If conversion
      cannot be achieved using the first domain, the next one is
      considered, and so on, until success is achieved.

         The function will first try to obtain a conversion by making

         If either of the {\tt{"}}from{\tt{"}} or {\tt{"}}to{\tt{"}} parameters is a pointer to a

         FrameSet to that described by the current Frame of the {\tt{"}}to{\tt{"}}
         FrameSet.

         To achieve this, it will consider all of the Frames within
         each FrameSet as a possible way of reaching an intermediate
         coordinate system that can be used for the conversion. There
         is then the possibility that more than one conversion path
         may exist and, unless the choice is sufficiently restricted
         by the {\tt{"}}domainlist{\tt{"}} string, the sequence in which the Frames
         are considered can be important. In this case, the search
         for a conversion path proceeds as follows:

            \sstitem
            Each field in the {\tt{"}}domainlist{\tt{"}} string is considered in turn.

            The Frames within each FrameSet are considered in a
            specific order: (1) the base Frame is always considered
            first, (2) after this come all the other Frames in
            Frame-index order (but omitting the base and current Frames),
            (3) the current Frame is always considered last.  However, if
            either FrameSet's \htmlref{Invert}{Invert} attribute is set to a non-zero value
            (so that the FrameSet is inverted), then its Frames are
            considered in reverse order. (Note that this still means that
            the base Frame is considered first and the current Frame
            last, because the Invert value will also cause these Frames
            to swap places.)

            \sstitem
            All source Frames are first considered (in the appropriate
            order) for conversion to the first destination Frame. If no
            suitable intermediate coordinate system emerges, they are
            then considered again for conversion to the second
            destination Frame (in the appropriate order), and so on.

            \sstitem
            Generally, the first suitable intermediate coordinate
            system found is used. However, the overall Mapping between
            the source and destination coordinate systems is also
            examined.  Preference is given to cases where both the
            forward and inverse transformations are defined (as indicated
            by the \htmlref{TranForward}{TranForward} and \htmlref{TranInverse}{TranInverse} attributes). If only one
            transformation is defined, the forward one is preferred.

            \sstitem
            If the domain of the intermediate coordinate system matches
            the current {\tt{"}}domainlist{\tt{"}} field, the conversion path is
            accepted. Otherwise, the next {\tt{"}}domainlist{\tt{"}} field is considered
            and the process repeated.

         }
         If conversion is possible, the Base attributes of the two
         FrameSets will be modified on exit to identify the Frames
         used to access the intermediate coordinate system which was
         finally accepted.

         Note that it is possible to force a particular Frame within a
         FrameSet to be used as the basis for the intermediate
         coordinate system, if it is suitable, by (a) focussing
         attention on
         it by specifying its domain in the {\tt{"}}domainlist{\tt{"}} string, or (b)
         making it the base Frame, since this is always considered

         returned without error.

         If a FrameSet is returned, it will contain two Frames. Frame
         number 1 (its base Frame) will describe the source coordinate
         system, corresponding to the {\tt{"}}from{\tt{"}} parameter. Frame number 2

      Keyword Templates
   }{
      The templates used to match FITS keywords are normally composed
      of literal characters, which must match the keyword exactly
      (apart from case). However, a template may also contain {\tt{"}}field
      specifiers{\tt{"}} which can match a range of possible characters. This
      allows you to search for keywords that contain (for example)
      numbers, where the digits comprising the number are not known in
      advance.

      A field specifier starts with a {\tt{"}}\%{\tt{"}} character. This is followed
      by an optional single digit (0 to 9) specifying a field
      width. Finally, there is a single character which specifies the
      type of character to be matched, as follows:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}c{\tt{"}}: matches all upper case letters,

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}d{\tt{"}}: matches all decimal digits,

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}f{\tt{"}}: matches all characters which are permitted within a FITS
         keyword (upper case letters, digits, underscores and hyphens).

      }
      If the field width is omitted, the field specifier matches one
      or more characters. If the field width is zero, it matches zero
      or more characters. Otherwise, it matches exactly the number of
      characters specified. In addition to this:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         The template {\tt{"}}\%f{\tt{"}} will match a blank FITS keyword consisting
         of 8 spaces (as well as matching all other keywords).

         \sstitem
         A template consisting of 8 spaces will match a blank keyword
         (only).

      }
      For example:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         The template {\tt{"}}BitPix{\tt{"}} will match the keyword {\tt{"}}BITPIX{\tt{"}} only.

         \sstitem
         The template {\tt{"}}crpix\%1d{\tt{"}} will match keywords consisting of
         {\tt{"}}CRPIX{\tt{"}} followed by one decimal digit.

         \sstitem
         The template {\tt{"}}P\%c{\tt{"}} will match any keyword starting with {\tt{"}}P{\tt{"}}
         and followed by one or more letters.

         \sstitem
         The template {\tt{"}}E\%0f{\tt{"}} will match any keyword beginning with {\tt{"}}E{\tt{"}}.

         \sstitem
         The template {\tt{"}}\%f{\tt{"}} will match any keyword at all (including a
         blank one).

   Find a coordinate system with specified characteristics
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This function uses a {\tt{"}}template{\tt{"}} \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} to search another Frame
      (or \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}) to identify a coordinate system which has a
      specified set of characteristics. If a suitable coordinate
      system can be found, the function returns a pointer to a
      FrameSet which describes the required coordinate system and how
      to convert coordinates to and from it.

      This function is provided to help answer general questions about
      coordinate systems, such as typically arise when coordinate
      information is imported into a program as part of an initially
      unknown dataset. For example:
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         Is there a wavelength scale?

         \sstitem
         Is there a 2-dimensional coordinate system?

         \sstitem
         Is there a celestial coordinate system?

         \sstitem
         Can I plot the data in ecliptic coordinates?

      }
      You can also use this function as a means of reconciling a
      user's preference for a particular coordinate system (for
      example, what type of axes to draw) with what is actually
      possible given the coordinate information available.

      To perform a search, you supply a {\tt{"}}target{\tt{"}} Frame (or FrameSet)
      which represents the set of coordinate systems to be searched.
      If a basic Frame is given as the target, this set of coordinate
      systems consists of the one described by this Frame, plus all
      other {\tt{"}}virtual{\tt{"}} coordinate systems which can potentially be
      reached from it by applying built-in conversions (for example,
      any of the celestial coordinate conversions known to the AST
      library would constitute a {\tt{"}}built-in{\tt{"}} conversion). If a FrameSet
      is given as the target, the set of coordinate systems to be
      searched consists of the union of those represented by all the
      individual Frames within it.

      To select from this large set of possible coordinate systems,
      you supply a {\tt{"}}template{\tt{"}} Frame which is an instance of the type
      of Frame you are looking for. Effectively, you then ask the
      function to {\tt{"}}find a coordinate system that looks like this{\tt{"}}.

      You can make your request more or less specific by setting
      attribute values for the template Frame. If a particular
      attribute is set in the template, then the function will only
      find coordinate systems which have exactly the same value for
      that attribute.  If you leave a template attribute un-set,
      however, then the function has discretion about the value the
      attribute should have in any coordinate system it finds. The
      attribute will then take its value from one of the actual
      (rather than virtual) coordinate systems in the target. If the
      target is a FrameSet, its \htmlref{Current}{Current} attribute will be modified to
      indicate which of its Frames was used for this purpose.

      The result of this process is a coordinate system represented by
      a hybrid Frame which acquires some attributes from the template
      (but only if they were set) and the remainder from the
      target. This represents the {\tt{"}}best compromise{\tt{"}} between what you
      asked for and what was available. A \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} is then generated
      which converts from the target coordinate system to this hybrid
      one, and the returned FrameSet encapsulates all of this
      information.

            cases where both the forward and inverse transformations are
            defined (as indicated by the \htmlref{TranForward}{TranForward} and \htmlref{TranInverse}{TranInverse}
            attributes). If only one transformation is defined, the
            forward one is preferred.

            \sstitem
            If a match is found and the domain of the resulting Frame also
            matches the current {\tt{"}}domainlist{\tt{"}} field, it is
            accepted. Otherwise, the next {\tt{"}}domainlist{\tt{"}} field is considered
            and the process repeated.

         }
         If a suitable coordinate system is found, the Current
         attribute of the target FrameSet will be modified on exit to
         identify the Frame whose match with the target was eventually
         accepted.

         If the search is successful, the function returns a pointer

         system it represents. Otherwise, a null \htmlref{Object}{Object} pointer
         (AST\_\_NULL) is returned without error.

         If a FrameSet is returned, it will contain two Frames. Frame
         number 1 (its base Frame) represents the target coordinate
         system and will be the same as the (base Frame of the)

         describe how to convert between their respective coordinate
         systems.

         Note that a FrameSet may be used both as a Mapping and as a
         Frame. If the result is used as a Mapping (e.g. with

         from the target coordinate system into the new coordinate
         system that was found (and vice versa if its inverse
         transformation is selected). If it is used as a Frame, its

      More on Using Templates
   }{
      A Frame (describing a coordinate system) will be found by this
      function if (a) it is {\tt{"}}matched{\tt{"}} by the template you supply, and
      (b) the value of its Domain attribute appears in the {\tt{"}}domainlist{\tt{"}}
      string (except that a blank field in this string permits any
      domain). A successful match by the template depends on a number
      of criteria, as outlined below:
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         In general, a template will only match another Frame which
         belongs to the same class as the template, or to a derived (more
         specialised) class. For example, a SkyFrame template will match
         any other SkyFrame, but will not match a basic
         Frame. Conversely, a basic Frame template will match any class
         of Frame.

         \sstitem
         If a template has a value set for any of its attributes, then
         it will only match Frames which have an identical value for that
         attribute (or which can be transformed, using a built-in
         conversion, so that they have the required value for that
         attribute). If any attribute in the template is un-set, however,
         then Frames are matched regardless of the value they may have
         for that attribute. You may therefore make a template more or
         less specific by choosing the attributes for which you set
         values.

         \sstitem
         An important application of this principle involves the Domain
         attribute. Setting the Domain attribute of the template has the
         effect of restricting the search to a particular type of Frame
         (with the domain you specify).  Conversely, if the Domain
         attribute is not set in the template, then the domain of the
         Frame found is not relevant, so all Frames are searched.  Note
         that the
         {\tt{"}}domainlist{\tt{"}} string provides an alternative way of restricting the
         search in the same manner, but is a more convenient interface if
         you wish to search automatically for another domain if the first
         search fails.

         \sstitem
         Normally, a template will only match a Frame which has the
         same number of axes as itself. However, for some classes of
         template, this default behaviour may be changed by means of the
         \htmlref{MinAxes}{MinAxes}, MaxAxes and \htmlref{MatchEnd}{MatchEnd} attributes. In addition, the
         behaviour of a template may be influenced by its Permute and
         PreserveAxes attributes, which control whether it matches Frames
         whose axes have been permuted, and whether this permutation is
         retained in the Frame which is returned (as opposed to returning
         the axes in the order specified in the template, which is the
         default behaviour). You should consult the descriptions of these
         attributes for details of this more advanced use of templates.

   Create a FitsChan
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This function creates a new \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} and optionally initialises
      its attributes.

      A FitsChan is a specialised form of \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} which supports I/O
      operations involving the use of FITS (Flexible Image Transport
      \htmlref{System}{System}) header cards. Writing an \htmlref{Object}{Object} to a FitsChan (using
      \htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite}) will, if the Object is suitable, generate a
      description of that Object composed of FITS header cards, and
      reading from a FitsChan will create a new Object from its FITS
      header card description.

      While a FitsChan is active, it represents a buffer which may
      contain zero or more 80-character {\tt{"}}header cards{\tt{"}} conforming to
      FITS conventions. Any sequence of FITS-conforming header cards
      may be stored, apart from the {\tt{"}}END{\tt{"}} card whose existence is
      merely implied.  The cards may be accessed in any order by using
      the FitsChan's integer \htmlref{Card}{Card} attribute, which identifies a {\tt{"}}current{\tt{"}}
      card, to which subsequent operations apply. Searches
      based on keyword may be performed (using \htmlref{astFindFits}{astFindFits}), new
      cards may be inserted (\htmlref{astPutFits}{astPutFits}) and existing ones may be
      deleted (\htmlref{astDelFits}{astDelFits}).

      When you create a FitsChan, you have the option of specifying
      {\tt{"}}source{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}sink{\tt{"}} functions which connect it to external data
      stores by reading and writing FITS header cards. If you provide
      a source function, it is used to fill the FitsChan with header
      cards when it is created. If you do not provide a source
      function, the FitsChan remains empty until you explicitly enter
      data into it (e.g. using astPutFits or astWrite). If you
      provide a sink function, it is used to deliver any remaining
      contents of a FitsChan to an external data store when the
      FitsChan is deleted. If you do not provide a sink function, any
      header cards remaining when the FitsChan is deleted will be
      lost, so you should arrange to extract them first if necessary
      (e.g. using astFindFits or \htmlref{astRead}{astRead}).

      Coordinate system information may be described using FITS header
      cards using several different conventions, termed
      {\tt{"}}encodings{\tt{"}}. When an AST Object is written to (or read from) a
      FitsChan, the value of the FitsChan's \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} attribute
      determines how the Object is converted to (or from) a
      description involving FITS header cards. In general, different
      encodings will result in different sets of header cards to
      describe the same Object. Examples of encodings include the DSS
      encoding (based on conventions used by the STScI Digitised Sky
      Survey data), the FITS-WCS encoding (based on a proposed FITS
      standard) and the NATIVE encoding (a near loss-less way of
      storing AST Objects in FITS headers).

      The available encodings differ in the range of Objects they can
      represent, in the number of Object descriptions that can coexist
      in the same FitsChan, and in their accessibility to other
      (external) astronomy applications (see the Encoding attribute
      for details). Encodings are not necessarily mutually exclusive
      and it may sometimes be possible to describe the same Object in
      several ways within a particular set of FITS header cards by
      using several different encodings.

      The detailed behaviour of astRead and astWrite, when used with
      a FitsChan, depends on the encoding in use. In general, however,
      all use of astRead is destructive, so that FITS header cards
      are consumed in the process of reading an Object, and are
      removed from the FitsChan.

      If the encoding in use allows only a single Object description
      to be stored in a FitsChan (e.g. the DSS, FITS-WCS and FITS-IRAF
      encodings), then write operations using astWrite will
      over-write any existing Object description using that
      encoding. Otherwise (e.g. the NATIVE encoding), multiple Object
      descriptions are written sequentially and may later be read
      back in the same sequence.

   Create a FrameSet
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This function creates a new \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} and optionally initialises
      its attributes.

      A FrameSet consists of a set of one or more Frames (which
      describe coordinate systems), connected together by Mappings
      (which describe how the coordinate systems are inter-related). A
      FrameSet makes it possible to obtain a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} between any pair
      of these Frames (i.e. to convert between any of the coordinate
      systems which it describes).  The individual Frames are
      identified within the FrameSet by an integer index, with Frames
      being numbered consecutively from one as they are added to the
      FrameSet.

      Every FrameSet has a {\tt{"}}base{\tt{"}} \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} and a {\tt{"}}current{\tt{"}} Frame (which
      are allowed to be the same). Any of the Frames may be nominated
      to hold these positions, and the choice is determined by the
      values of the FrameSet's \htmlref{Base}{Base} and \htmlref{Current}{Current} attributes, which hold
      the indices of the relevant Frames.  By default, the first Frame
      added to a FrameSet is its base Frame, and the last one added is
      its current Frame.

      The base Frame describes the {\tt{"}}native{\tt{"}} coordinate system of
      whatever the FrameSet is used to calibrate (e.g. the pixel
      coordinates of an image) and the current Frame describes the
      {\tt{"}}apparent{\tt{"}} coordinate system in which it should be viewed
      (e.g. displayed, etc.). Any further Frames represent a library
      of alternative coordinate systems, which may be selected by
      making them current.

      When a FrameSet is used in a context that requires a Frame,
      (e.g. obtaining its \htmlref{Title}{Title} value, or number of axes), the current
      Frame is used. A FrameSet may therefore be used in place of its
      current Frame in most situations.

      When a FrameSet is used in a context that requires a Mapping,
      the Mapping used is the one between its base Frame and its
      current Frame. Thus, a FrameSet may be used to convert {\tt{"}}native{\tt{"}}
      coordinates into {\tt{"}}apparent{\tt{"}} ones, and vice versa. Like any
      Mapping, a FrameSet may also be inverted (see \htmlref{astInvert}{astInvert}), which
      has the effect of interchanging its base and current Frames and
      hence of reversing the Mapping between them.

         Beware that an external representation of an IntraMap (created
         by writing it to a Channel) will not include the coordinate
         transformation function which it uses, so will only refer to the
         function by its name (as assigned using astIntraReg).
         Consequently, the external representation cannot be utilised by
         another program unless that program has also registered the same
         transformation function with the same name using an identical
         invocation of astIntraReg. If no such registration has been
         performed, then attempting to read the external representation
         will result in an error.

         \sstitem
         You may use astIntraReg to register a transformation function
         with the same name more than once, but only if the arguments
         supplied are identical on each occasion (i.e there is no way of
         changing things once a function has been successfully registered
         under a given name, and attempting to do so will result in an
         error). This feature simply allows registration to be performed
         independently, but consistently, at several places within your
         program, without having to check whether it has already been
         done.

         \sstitem
         If an error occurs in the transformation function, this may be
         indicated by setting the AST error status to an error value
         (using \htmlref{astSetStatus}{astSetStatus}) before it returns.  This will immediately
         terminate the current AST operation.  The error value AST\_\_ITFER
         is available for this purpose, but other values may also be used
         (e.g. if you wish to distinguish different types of error).

      ``flags'' argument to astIntraReg.

         AST\_\_NOFWD: If this flag is set, it indicates that the

         have a \htmlref{TranForward}{TranForward} attribute value of zero and the
         transformation function itself will not be invoked with its
         ``forward'' argument set to a non-zero value.  By default, it is
         assumed that a forward transformation is provided.

         followed immediately by the matching inverse transformation,
         should always restore the original set of coordinates. It
         indicates that AST may replace such a sequence of operations by
         an identity Mapping (a \htmlref{UnitMap}{UnitMap}) if it is encountered while

      A LutMap is a specialised form of \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which transforms
      1-dimensional coordinates by using linear interpolation in a
      lookup table.  Each input coordinate value is first scaled to
      give the index of an entry in the table by subtracting a
      starting value (the input coordinate corresponding to the first
      table entry) and dividing by an increment (the difference in
      input coordinate value between adjacent table entries).

      The resulting index will usually contain a fractional part, so
      the output coordinate value is then generated by interpolating
      linearly between the appropriate entries in the table. If the
      index lies outside the range of the table, linear extrapolation
      is used based on the two nearest entries (i.e. the two entries
      at the start or end of the table, as appropriate).

      This function creates a new \htmlref{MathMap}{MathMap} and optionally initialises its

      A MathMap is a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which allows you to specify a set of forward
      and/or inverse transformation functions using arithmetic operations
      and mathematical functions similar to those available in C. The
      MathMap interprets these functions at run-time, whenever its forward
      or inverse transformation is required. Because the functions are not
      compiled in the normal sense (unlike an \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap}), they may be used to
      describe coordinate transformations in a transportable manner. A
      MathMap therefore provides a flexible way of defining new types of
      Mapping whose descriptions may be stored as part of a dataset and

   \sstdiytopic{
      Defining Transformation Functions
   }{
      A MathMap's transformation functions are supplied as a set of
      expressions in an array of character strings. Normally you would
      supply the same number of expressions for the forward transformation,
      via the {\tt{"}}fwd{\tt{"}} parameter, as there are output variables (given by the
      MathMap's Nout attribute). For instance, if Nout is 2 you might use:
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}r = sqrt( x $*$ x $+$ y $*$ y ){\tt{"}}

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}theta = atan2( y, x ){\tt{"}}

      }
      which defines a transformation from Cartesian to polar
      coordinates. Here, the variables that appear on the left of each
      expression ({\tt{"}}r{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}theta{\tt{"}}) provide names for the output variables
      and those that appear on the right ({\tt{"}}x{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}y{\tt{"}}) are references to
      input variables.

      To complement this, you must also supply expressions for the inverse
      transformation via the {\tt{"}}inv{\tt{"}} parameter.  In this case, the number of
      expressions given would normally match the number of MathMap input
      coordinates (given by the Nin attribute).  If Nin is 2, you might use:
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}x = r $*$ cos( theta ){\tt{"}}

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}y = r $*$ sin( theta ){\tt{"}}

      }
      which expresses the transformation from polar to Cartesian
      coordinates. Note that here the input variables ({\tt{"}}x{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}y{\tt{"}}) are
      named on the left of each expression, and the output variables ({\tt{"}}r{\tt{"}}
      and {\tt{"}}theta{\tt{"}}) are referenced on the right.

      Normally, you cannot refer to a variable on the right of an expression
      unless it is named on the left of an expression in the complementary
      set of functions. Therefore both sets of functions (forward and
      inverse) must be formulated using the same consistent set of variable
      names. This means that if you wish to leave one of the transformations
      undefined, you must supply dummy expressions which simply name each of
      the output (or input) variables.  For example, you might use:
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}x{\tt{"}}

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}y{\tt{"}}

      }
      for the inverse transformation above, which serves to name the input
      variables but without defining an inverse transformation.
   }
   \sstdiytopic{
      Calculating Intermediate Values
   }{
      It is sometimes useful to calculate intermediate values and then to
      use these in the final expressions for the output (or input)
      variables. This may be done by supplying additional expressions for
      the forward (or inverse) transformation functions. For instance, the
      following array of five expressions describes 2-dimensional pin-cushion
      distortion:
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}r = sqrt( xin $*$ xin $+$ yin $*$ yin ){\tt{"}}

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}rout = r $*$ ( 1 $+$ 0.1 $*$ r $*$ r ){\tt{"}}

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}theta = atan2( yin, xin ){\tt{"}}

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}xout = rout $*$ cos( theta ){\tt{"}}

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}yout = rout $*$ sin( theta ){\tt{"}}

      }
      Here, we first calculate three intermediate results ({\tt{"}}r{\tt{"}}, {\tt{"}}rout{\tt{"}}
      and {\tt{"}}theta{\tt{"}}) and then use these to calculate the final results ({\tt{"}}xout{\tt{"}}
      and {\tt{"}}yout{\tt{"}}). The MathMap knows that only the final two results
      constitute values for the output variables because its Nout attribute
      is set to 2. You may define as many intermediate variables in this
      way as you choose. Having defined a variable, you may then refer to it
      on the right of any subsequent expressions.

      Note that when defining the inverse transformation you may only refer
      to the output variables {\tt{"}}xout{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}yout{\tt{"}}.  The intermediate variables
      {\tt{"}}r{\tt{"}}, {\tt{"}}rout{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}theta{\tt{"}} (above) are private to the forward
      transformation and may not be referenced by the inverse
      transformation. The inverse transformation may, however, define its
      own private intermediate variables.
   }
   \sstdiytopic{
      Expression Syntax
   }{
      The expressions given for the forward and inverse transformations
      closely follow the syntax of the C programming language (with some
      extensions for compatibility with Fortran). They may contain
      references to variables and literal constants, together with
      arithmetic, boolean, relational and bitwise operators, and function
      invocations. A set of symbolic constants is also available. Each of
      these is described in detail below. Parentheses may be used to
      over-ride the normal order of evaluation. There is no built-in limit
      to the length of expressions and they are insensitive to case or the
      presence of additional white space.

      in expressions, with the decimal point and exponent being optional (a
      {\tt{"}}D{\tt{"}} may also be used as an exponent character for compatibility with

      expressions by the symbolic constant {\tt{"}}$<$bad$>${\tt{"}}.

      A $<$bad$>$ result (i.e. equal to AST\_\_BAD) is also produced in response

      be 0, 1 or AST\_\_BAD. Where appropriate, {\tt{"}}tri-state{\tt{"}} logic is

      Bitwise Operators
   }{
      The bitwise operators provided by C are often useful when operating on
      raw data (e.g. from instruments), so they are also provided for use in
      MathMap expressions. In this case, however, the values on which they
      operate are floating point values rather than pure integers. In order
      to produce results which match the pure integer case, the operands are
      regarded as fixed point binary numbers (i.e. with the binary
      equivalent of a decimal point) with negative numbers represented using
      twos-complement notation. For integer values, the resulting bit
      pattern corresponds to that of the equivalent signed integer (digits
      to the right of the point being zero). Operations on the bits
      representing the fractional part are also possible, however.

      The following bitwise operators are available:

         shifted this number of places to the left (or to the right if the

         by the corresponding power of 2.

   Create a PcdMap
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This function creates a new \htmlref{PcdMap}{PcdMap} and optionally initialises its
      attributes.

      A PcdMap is a non-linear \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which transforms 2-dimensional
      positions to correct for the radial distortion introduced by some
      cameras and telescopes. This can take the form either of pincushion
      or barrel distortion, and is characterized by a single distortion
      coefficient.

      A PcdMap is specified by giving this distortion coefficient and the
      coordinates of the centre of the radial distortion. The forward
      transformation of a PcdMap applies the distortion:

         RD = R $*$ ( 1 $+$ C $*$ R $*$ R )

      where R is the undistorted radial distance from the distortion
      centre (specified by attribute PcdCen), RD is the radial distance
      from the same centre in the presence of distortion, and C is the
      distortion coefficient (given by attribute \htmlref{Disco}{Disco}).

      The inverse transformation of a PcdMap removes the distortion
      produced by the forward transformation. The expression used to derive
      R from RD is an approximate inverse of the expression above, obtained
      from two iterations of the Newton-Raphson method. The mismatch between
      the forward and inverse expressions is negligible for astrometric

   Create a Plot
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This function creates a new \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} and optionally initialises its
      attributes.

      A Plot is a specialised form of \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, in which the base
      \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} describes a {\tt{"}}graphical{\tt{"}} coordinate system and is
      associated with a rectangular plotting area in the underlying
      graphics system. This plotting area is where graphical output
      appears. It is defined when the Plot is created.

      The current Frame of a Plot describes a {\tt{"}}physical{\tt{"}} coordinate
      system, which is the coordinate system in which plotting
      operations are specified. The results of each plotting operation
      are automatically transformed into graphical coordinates so as
      to appear in the plotting area (subject to any clipping which
      may be in effect).

      Because the \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} between physical and graphical coordinates
      may often be non-linear, or even discontinuous, most plotting
      does not result in simple straight lines. The basic plotting
      element is therefore not a straight line, but a geodesic curve
      (see \htmlref{astCurve}{astCurve}). A Plot also provides facilities for drawing
      markers or symbols (\htmlref{astMark}{astMark}), text (\htmlref{astText}{astText}) and grid lines
      (\htmlref{astGridLine}{astGridLine}). It is also possible to draw curvilinear axes with
      optional coordinate grids (\htmlref{astGrid}{astGrid}).
      A range of Plot attributes is available to allow precise control
      over the appearance of graphical output produced by these
      functions.

      You may select different physical coordinate systems in which to
      plot (including the native graphical coordinate system itself)
      by selecting different Frames as the current Frame of a Plot,
      using its \htmlref{Current}{Current} attribute.  You may also set up clipping (see
      \htmlref{astClip}{astClip}) to limit the extent of any plotting you perform, and
      this may be done in any of the coordinate systems associated
      with the Plot, not necessarily the one you are plotting in.

      Like any FrameSet, a Plot may also be used as a Frame. In this
      case, it behaves like its current Frame, which describes the
      physical coordinate system.

      When used as a Mapping, a Plot describes the inter-relation
      between graphical coordinates (its base Frame) and physical
      coordinates (its current Frame).  It differs from a normal
      FrameSet, however, in that an attempt to transform points which
      lie in clipped areas of the Plot will result in bad coordinate
      values (AST\_\_BAD).

}{
   Resample a region of a data grid
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This is a set of functions for resampling gridded data (e.g. an
      image) under the control of a geometrical transformation, which
      is specified by a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}.  The functions operate on a pair of
      data grids (input and output), each of which may have any number
      of dimensions. Resampling may be restricted to a specified
      region of the output grid. An associated grid of error estimates
      associated with the input data may also be supplied (in the form
      of variance values), so as to produce error estimates for the
      resampled output data. Propagation of missing data (bad pixels)
      is supported.

      You should use a resampling function which matches the numerical
      type of the data you are processing by replacing $<$X$>$ in
      the generic function name astResample$<$X$>$ by an appropriate 1- or
      2-character type code. For example, if you are resampling data
      with type {\tt{"}}float{\tt{"}}, you should use the function astResampleF (see
      the {\tt{"}}Data Type Codes{\tt{"}} section below for the codes appropriate to
      other numerical types).

      Resampling of the grid of input data is performed by
      transforming the coordinates of the centre of each output grid
      element (or pixel) into the coordinate system of the input grid.
      Since the resulting coordinates will not, in general, coincide
      with the centre of an input pixel, sub-pixel interpolation is
      performed between the neighbouring input pixels. This produces a
      resampled value which is then assigned to the output pixel. A
      choice of sub-pixel interpolation schemes is provided, but you
      may also implement your own.

      Output pixel coordinates are transformed into the coordinate
      system of the input grid using the inverse transformation of the
      Mapping which is supplied. This means that geometrical features
      in the input data are subjected to the Mapping's forward
      transformation as they are transferred from the input to the
      output grid (although the Mapping's forward transformation is
      not explicitly used).

      In practice, transforming the coordinates of every pixel of a
      large data grid can be time-consuming, especially if the Mapping
      involves complicated functions, such as sky projections. To
      improve performance, it is therefore possible to approximate
      non-linear Mappings by a set of linear transformations which are
      applied piece-wise to separate sub-regions of the data. This
      approximation process is applied automatically by an adaptive
      algorithm, under control of an accuracy criterion which
      expresses the maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may
      be introduced, as a fraction of a pixel.

      This algorithm first attempts to approximate the Mapping with a
      linear transformation applied over the whole region of the
      output grid which is being used. If this proves to be
      insufficiently accurate, the output region is sub-divided into
      two along its largest dimension and the process is repeated
      within each of the resulting sub-regions. This process of
      sub-division continues until a sufficiently good linear
      approximation is found, or the region to which it is being
      applied becomes too small (in which case the original Mapping is
      used directly).

         A value which specifies an initial scale size (in pixels) for

         the output grid being used). In this case, a first attempt to
         approximate the Mapping by a linear transformation will be
         made over the entire output region.

         If a smaller value is used, the output region will first be
         divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed {\tt{"}}maxpix{\tt{"}}
         pixels in any dimension. Only at this point will attempts at
         approximation commence.

         This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false
         convergence of the adaptive algorithm in cases where the
         Mapping appears approximately linear on large scales, but has
         irregularities (e.g. holes) on smaller scales. A value of,
         say, 50 to 100 pixels can also be employed as a safeguard in
         general-purpose software, since the effect on performance is
         minimal.

         If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of
         inhibiting linear approximation altogether (equivalent to

         data (bad pixels) in the input and output arrays.

         If the AST\_\_USEBAD flag is set via the {\tt{"}}flags{\tt{"}} parameter,
         then this value is used to test for bad pixels in the {\tt{"}}in{\tt{"}}

         In all cases, this value is also used to flag any output

         resampled values could not be obtained (see the {\tt{"}}Propagation

   \sstdiytopic{
      Sub-Pixel Interpolation Schemes
   }{
      There is no such thing as a perfect sub-pixel interpolation
      scheme and, in practice, all resampling will result in some
      degradation of gridded data.  A range of schemes is therefore
      provided, from which you can choose the one which best suits
      your needs.

      In general, a balance must be struck between schemes which tend
      to degrade sharp features in the data by smoothing them, and
      those which attempt to preserve sharp features. The latter will
      often tend to introduce unwanted oscillations, typically visible
      as {\tt{"}}ringing{\tt{"}} around sharp features and edges, especially if the
      data are under-sampled (i.e. if the sharpest features are less
      than about two pixels across). In practice, a good interpolation
      scheme is likely to be a compromise and may exhibit some aspects
      of both these features.

      For under-sampled data, some interpolation schemes may appear to
      preserve data resolution because they transform single input
      pixels into single output pixels, rather than spreading their
      data between several output pixels. While this may look
      better cosmetically, it can result in a geometrical shift of
      sharp features in the data. You should beware of this if you
      plan to use such features (e.g.) for image alignment.

      The following are two easy-to-use sub-pixel interpolation
      schemes which are generally applicable. They are selected by
      supplying the appropriate value (defined in the {\tt{"}}ast.h{\tt{"}} header
      file) via the {\tt{"}}interp{\tt{"}} parameter. In these cases, the {\tt{"}}finterp{\tt{"}}
      and {\tt{"}}params{\tt{"}} parameters are not used:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         AST\_\_NEAREST: This is the simplest possible scheme, in which
         the value of the input pixel with the nearest centre to the
         interpolation point is used. This is very quick to execute and
         will preserve single-pixel features in the data, but may
         displace them by up to half their width along each dimension. It
         often gives a good cosmetic result, so is useful for quick-look
         processing, but is unsuitable if accurate geometrical
         transformation is required.

         \sstitem
         AST\_\_LINEAR: This is the default scheme, which uses linear
         interpolation between the nearest neighbouring pixels in the
         input grid (there are two neighbours in one dimension, four
         neighbours in two dimensions, eight in three dimensions,
         etc.). It is superior to the nearest-pixel scheme (above) in not
         displacing features in the data, yet it still executes fairly
         rapidly. It is generally a safe choice if you do not have any
         particular reason to favour another scheme, since it cannot
         introduce oscillations. However, it does introduce some spatial
         smoothing which varies according to the distance of the
         interpolation point from the neighbouring pixels. This can
         degrade the shape of sharp features in the data in a
         position-dependent way. It may also show in the output variance
         grid (if used) as a pattern of stripes or fringes.

      }
      An alternative set of interpolation schemes is based on forming
      the interpolated value from the weighted sum of a set of
      surrounding pixel values (not necessarily just the nearest
      neighbours). This approach has its origins in the theory of
      digital filtering, in which interpolated values are obtained by
      conceptually passing the sampled data (represented by a grid of
      delta functions) through a linear filter which implements a
      convolution. Because the convolution kernel is continuous, the
      convolution yields a continuous function which may then be
      evaluated at fractional pixel positions. The (possibly
      multi-dimensional) kernel is usually regarded as {\tt{"}}separable{\tt{"}} and
      formed from the product of a set of identical 1-dimensional
      kernel functions, evaluated along each dimension. Different
      interpolation schemes are then distinguished by the choice of
      this 1-dimensional interpolation kernel. The number of
      surrounding pixels which contribute to the result may also be
      varied.

      From a practical standpoint, it is useful to divide the weighted
      sum of pixel values by the sum of the weights when determining
      the interpolated value.  Strictly, this means that a true
      convolution is no longer being performed. However, the
      distinction is rarely important in practice because (for
      slightly subtle reasons) the sum of weights is always
      approximately constant for good interpolation kernels. The
      advantage of this technique, which is used here, is that it can
      easily accommodate missing data and tends to minimise unwanted
      oscillations at the edges of the data grid.

      In the following schemes, which are based on a 1-dimensional
      interpolation kernel, the first element of the {\tt{"}}params{\tt{"}} array
      should be used to specify how many pixels are to contribute to the
      interpolated result on either side of the interpolation point in
      each dimension (the nearest integer value is used). Execution time
      increases rapidly with this number. Typically, a value of 2 is
      appropriate and the minimum value used will be 1 (i.e. one pixel on
      either side). A value of zero or less may be given for {\tt{"}}params[0]{\tt{"}}
      to indicate that a suitable number of pixels should be calculated
      automatically.

      In each of these cases, the {\tt{"}}finterp{\tt{"}} parameter is not used:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         AST\_\_SINC: This scheme uses a sinc(pi$*$x) kernel, where x is the
         pixel offset from the interpolation point and sinc(z)=sin(z)/z. This
         sometimes features as an {\tt{"}}optimal{\tt{"}} interpolation kernel in books on
         image processing. Its supposed optimality depends on the assumption
         that the data are band-limited (i.e. have no spatial frequencies above
         a certain value) and are adequately sampled. In practice, astronomical
         data rarely meet these requirements. In addition, high spatial
         frequencies are often present due (e.g.) to image defects and cosmic
         ray events. Consequently, substantial ringing can be experienced with
         this kernel. The kernel also decays slowly with distance, so that
         many surrounding pixels are required, leading to poor performance.
         Abruptly truncating it, by using only a few neighbouring pixels,
         improves performance and may reduce ringing (if {\tt{"}}params[0]{\tt{"}} is set to
         zero, then only two pixels will be used on either side). However, a
         more gradual truncation, as implemented by other kernels, is generally
         to be preferred. This kernel is provided mainly so that you can
         convince yourself not to use it!

         \sstitem
         AST\_\_SINCSINC: This scheme uses an improved kernel, of the form
         sinc(pi$*$x).sinc(k$*$pi$*$x), with k a constant, out to the point where
         sinc(k$*$pi$*$x) goes to zero, and zero beyond. The second sinc() factor
         provides an {\tt{"}}envelope{\tt{"}} which gradually rolls off the normal sinc(pi$*$x)
         kernel at large offsets. The width of this envelope is specified by
         giving the number of pixels offset at which it goes to zero by means
         of the {\tt{"}}params[1]{\tt{"}} value, which should be at least 1.0 (in addition,
         setting {\tt{"}}params[0]{\tt{"}} to zero will select the number of contributing
         pixels so as to utilise the full width of the kernel, out to where it
         reaches zero). The case given by {\tt{"}}params[0]=2, params[1]=2{\tt{"}} is typically
         a good choice and is sometimes known as the Lanczos kernel. This is a
         valuable general-purpose interpolation scheme, intermediate in its
         visual effect on images between the AST\_\_NEAREST and AST\_\_LINEAR
         schemes. Although the kernel is slightly oscillatory, ringing is
         adequately suppressed if the data are well sampled.

         \sstitem
         AST\_\_SINCCOS: This scheme uses a kernel of the form
         sinc(pi$*$x).cos(k$*$pi$*$x), with k a constant, out to the point where
         cos(k$*$pi$*$x) goes to zero, and zero beyond. As above, the cos() factor
         provides an envelope which gradually rolls off the sinc() kernel
         at large offsets. The width of this envelope is specified by giving
         the number of pixels offset at which it goes to zero by means
         of the {\tt{"}}params[1]{\tt{"}} value, which should be at least 1.0 (in addition,
         setting {\tt{"}}params[0]{\tt{"}} to zero will select the number of contributing
         pixels so as to utilise the full width of the kernel, out to where it
         reaches zero). This scheme gives similar results to the
         AST\_\_SINCSINC scheme, which it resembles.

         \sstitem
         AST\_\_SINCGAUSS: This scheme uses a kernel of the form
         sinc(pi$*$x).exp(-k$*$x$*$x), with k a positive constant. Here, the sinc()
         kernel is rolled off using a Gaussian envelope which is specified by
         giving its full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) by means of the {\tt{"}}params[1]{\tt{"}}
         value, which should be at least 0.1 (in addition, setting {\tt{"}}params[0]{\tt{"}}
         to zero will select the number of contributing pixels so as to utilise
         the width of the kernel out to where the envelope declines to 1\% of its
         maximum value). On astronomical images and spectra, good results are
         often obtained by approximately matching the FWHM of the
         envelope function, given by {\tt{"}}params[1]{\tt{"}}, to the point spread function
         of the input data. However, there does not seem to be any theoretical
         reason for this.

      }
      In addition, the following schemes are provided which are not based
      on a 1-dimensional kernel:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         AST\_\_BLOCKAVE: This scheme simply takes an average of all the
         pixels on the input grid in a cube centred on the interpolation
         point.  The number of pixels in the cube is determined by the
         value of the first element of the {\tt{"}}params{\tt{"}} array, which gives
         the number of pixels in each dimension on either side of the
         central point.  Hence a block of (2 $*$ params[0] $+$ 1)$\wedge$ndim\_in
         pixels in the input grid will be examined to determine the
         value of the output pixel.  If the variance is not being used
         (var\_in or var\_out = NULL) then all valid pixels in this cube
         will be averaged in to the result with equal weight.
         If variances are being used, then each input pixel will be
         weighted proportionally to the reciprocal of its variance; any
         pixel without a valid variance will be discarded.  This scheme
         is suitable where the output grid is much coarser than the
         input grid; if the ratio of pixel sizes is R then a suitable
         value of params[0] may be (R - 1)/2.

      }
      Finally, supplying the following values for {\tt{"}}interp{\tt{"}} allows you
      to implement your own sub-pixel interpolation scheme by means of
      your own function. You should supply a pointer to this function
      via the {\tt{"}}finterp{\tt{"}} parameter:

      \sstitemlist{

         your own 1-dimensional interpolation kernel, which is then used
         to perform sub-pixel interpolation (as described above). The
         function you supply should have the same interface as the
         fictitious \htmlref{astUkern1}{astUkern1} function (q.v.).  In addition, a value
         should be given via {\tt{"}}params[0]{\tt{"}} to specify the number of
         neighbouring pixels which are to contribute to each interpolated
         value (in the same way as for the pre-defined interpolation
         schemes described above). Other elements of the {\tt{"}}params{\tt{"}} array
         are available to pass values to your interpolation function.

         \sstitem
         AST\_\_UINTERP: This is a completely general scheme, in which
         your interpolation function has access to all of the input
         data. This allows you to implement any interpolation algorithm
         you choose, which could (for example) be non-linear, or
         adaptive. In this case, the astResample$<$X$>$ functions play no
         role in the sub-pixel interpolation process and simply handle
         the geometrical transformation of coordinates and other
         housekeeping. The function you supply should have the same
         interface as the fictitious \htmlref{astUinterp}{astUinterp} function (q.v.). In this
         case, the {\tt{"}}params{\tt{"}} parameter is not used by astResample$<$X$>$, but
         is available to pass values to your interpolation function.

      system conversions provided by the SLALIB Positional Astronomy
      Library (Starlink User Note SUN/67) to an existing \htmlref{SlaMap}{SlaMap}.

      When an SlaMap is first created (using \htmlref{astSlaMap}{astSlaMap}), it simply
      performs a unit (null) \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}. By using astSlaAdd (repeatedly
      if necessary), one or more coordinate conversion steps may then
      be added, which the SlaMap will perform in sequence. This allows
      multi-step conversions between a variety of celestial coordinate
      systems to be assembled out of the building blocks provided by
      SLALIB.

      Normally, if an SlaMap's \htmlref{Invert}{Invert} attribute is zero (the default),

      each of the individual coordinate conversions specified by
      astSlaAdd in the order given (i.e. with the most recently added

      replaced by its own inverse. This process inverts the overall
      effect of the SlaMap. In this case, the first conversion to be

      This function creates a new \htmlref{SlaMap}{SlaMap} and optionally initialises

      An SlaMap is a specialised form of \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which can be used to
      represent a sequence of conversions between standard celestial
      (longitude, latitude) coordinate systems.

      When an SlaMap is first created, it simply performs a unit
      (null) Mapping on a pair of coordinates. Using the \htmlref{astSlaAdd}{astSlaAdd}
      function, a series of coordinate conversion steps may then be
      added, selected from those provided by the SLALIB Positional
      Astronomy Library (Starlink User Note SUN/67). This allows
      multi-step conversions between a variety of celestial coordinate
      systems to be assembled out of the building blocks provided by
      SLALIB.

      For details of the individual coordinate conversions available,

      This function applies a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} to transform the coordinates of
      a set of points in an arbitrary number of dimensions. It is the

      it.

      The input format accepted for a SkyFrame axis is as follows:

         \sstitem
         An optional sign, followed by between one and three fields
         representing either degrees, arc-minutes, arc-seconds or hours,
         minutes, seconds (e.g. {\tt{"}}-12 42 03{\tt{"}}).

         \sstitem
         Each field should consist of a sequence of one or more digits,
         which may include leading zeros. At most one field may contain a
         decimal point, in which case it is taken to be the final field
         (e.g. decimal degrees might be given as {\tt{"}}124.707{\tt{"}}, while degrees
         and decimal arc-minutes might be given as {\tt{"}}-13 33.8{\tt{"}}).

         \sstitem
         The first field given may take any value, allowing angles and
         times outside the conventional ranges to be
         represented. However, subsequent fields must have values of less
         than 60 (e.g. {\tt{"}}720 45 31{\tt{"}} is valid, whereas {\tt{"}}11 45 61{\tt{"}} is not).

         \sstitem
         Fields may be separated by white space or by {\tt{"}}:{\tt{"}} (colon), but
         the choice of separator must be used consistently throughout the
         value. Additional white space may be present around fields and
         separators (e.g. {\tt{"}}- 2: 04 : 7.1{\tt{"}}).

         \sstitem
         The following field identification characters may be used as
         separators to replace either of those above (or may be appended
         to the final field), in order to identify the field to which
         they are appended: {\tt{"}}d{\tt{"}}---degrees; {\tt{"}}h{\tt{"}}---hours; {\tt{"}}m{\tt{"}}---minutes of
         arc or time; {\tt{"}}s{\tt{"}}---seconds of arc or time; {\tt{"}}'{\tt{"}} (single
         quote)---minutes of arc; {\tt{"}}{\tt{"}}{\tt{"}} (double quote)---seconds of arc.
         Either lower or upper case may be used.  Fields must be given in
         order of decreasing significance (e.g. {\tt{"}}-11D 3' 14.4{\tt{"}}{\tt{"}} or
         {\tt{"}}22h14m11.2s{\tt{"}}).

         \sstitem
         The presence of any of the field identification characters
         {\tt{"}}d{\tt{"}}, {\tt{"}}'{\tt{"}} (single quote) or {\tt{"}}{\tt{"}}{\tt{"}} (double quote) indicates that the
         value is to be interpreted as an angle. Conversely, the presence
         of {\tt{"}}h{\tt{"}} indicates that it is to be interpreted as a time (with 24
         hours corresponding to 360 degrees). Incompatible angle/time
         identification characters may not be mixed (e.g. {\tt{"}}10h14'3{\tt{"}}{\tt{"}} is
         not valid).  The remaining field identification characters and
         separators do not specify a preference for an angle or a time
         and may be used with either.

         \sstitem
         If no preference for an angle or a time is expressed anywhere
         within the value, it is interpreted as an angle if the Format
         attribute string associated with the SkyFrame axis generates an
         angle and as a time otherwise. This ensures that values produced
         by astFormat are correctly interpreted by astUnformat.

         \sstitem
         Fields may be omitted, in which case they default to zero. The
         remaining fields may be identified by using appropriate field
         identification characters (see above) and/or by adding extra
         colon separators (e.g. {\tt{"}}-05m13s{\tt{"}} is equivalent to {\tt{"}}-:05:13{\tt{"}}). If
         a field is not identified explicitly, it is assumed that
         adjacent fields have been given, after taking account of any
         extra separator characters (e.g. {\tt{"}}14:25.4s{\tt{"}} specifies minutes
         and seconds, while {\tt{"}}14::25.4s{\tt{"}} specifies degrees and seconds).

         \sstitem
         If fields are omitted in such a way that the remaining ones
         cannot be identified uniquely (e.g. {\tt{"}}01:02{\tt{"}}), then the first
         field (either given explicitly or implied by an extra leading
         colon separator) is taken to be the most significant field that
         astFormat would produce when formatting a value (using the
         Format attribute associated with the SkyFrame axis).  By
         default, this means that the first field will normally be
         interpreted as degrees or hours. However, if this does not
         result in consistent field identification, then the last field
         (either given explicitly or implied by an extra trailing colon
         separator) is taken to to be the least significant field that
         astFormat would produce.

      }
      This final convention is intended to ensure that values formatted
      by astFormat which contain less than three fields will be
      correctly interpreted if read back using astUnformat, even if
      they do not contain field identification characters.

   Create a WcsMap
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This function creates a new \htmlref{WcsMap}{WcsMap} and optionally initialises its
      attributes.

      A WcsMap is used to represent sky coordinate projections as
      described in the (draft) FITS world coordinate system (FITS-WCS)
      paper by E.W. Griesen and M. Calabretta (A \& A, in preparation).
      This paper defines a set of functions, or sky projections, which
      transform longitude-latitude pairs representing spherical
      celestial coordinates into corresponding pairs of Cartesian
      coordinates (and vice versa).

      A WcsMap is a specialised form of \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which implements these
      sky projections (all of those in the FITS-WCS paper are
      supported) and applies them to a specified pair of coordinates.
      Using the FITS-WCS terminology, this transformation is between
      {\tt{"}}native spherical{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}relative physical{\tt{"}} coordinates.  These
      coordinates may, optionally, be embedded in a space with more
      than two dimensions, the remaining coordinates being copied
      unchanged. Note, however, that for consistency with other AST
      facilities, a WcsMap handles coordinates that represent angles
      in radians (rather than the degrees used by FITS-WCS).

      The type of FITS-WCS projection to be used and the coordinates
      (axes) to which it applies are specified when a WcsMap is first
      created. The projection type may subsequently be determined
      using the \htmlref{WcsType}{WcsType} attribute and the coordinates on which it acts
      may be determined using the \htmlref{WcsAxis(lonlat)}{WcsAxislonlat} attribute.

      Each WcsMap also allows up to 99 {\tt{"}}projection parameters{\tt{"}} to be
      associated with each axis. These specify the precise form of the
      projection, and are accessed using \htmlref{PVj\_m}{PVj_m} attribute, where {\tt{"}}j{\tt{"}} is
      the integer axis index (starting at 1), and m is an integer
      {\tt{"}}parameter index{\tt{"}} in the range 0 to 99. The number of projection
      parameters required by each projection, and their meanings, are
      dependent upon the projection type (most projections either do not
      use any projection parameters, or use parameters 1 and 2 associated
      with the latitude axis). Before creating a WcsMap you should consult
      the FITS-WCS paper for details of which projection parameters are
      required, and which have defaults. When creating the WcsMap, you must
      explicitly set values for all those required projection parameters
      which do not have defaults defined in this paper.

   Format celestal coordinates as times?
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This attribute specifies the default style of formatting to be
      used (e.g. by \htmlref{astFormat}{astFormat}) for the celestial coordinate values
      described by a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}. It takes a separate boolean value for
      each SkyFrame axis so that, for instance, the setting
      {\tt{"}}AsTime(2)=0{\tt{"}} specifies the default formatting style for
      celestial latitude values.

      If the AsTime attribute for a SkyFrame axis is zero, then
      coordinates on that axis will be formatted as angles by default
      (using degrees, minutes and seconds), otherwise they will be
      formatted as times (using hours, minutes and seconds).

      The default value of AsTime is chosen according to the sky
      coordinate system being represented, as determined by the
      SkyFrame's \htmlref{System}{System} attribute. This ensures, for example, that
      right ascension values will be formatted as times by default,

         The AsTime attribute operates by changing the default value of

         Only the default style of formatting is affected by the AsTime
         value. If an explicit Format(axis) value is set, it will

      be drawn as part of the grid. Otherwise, the border is not drawn
      (although axis labels and tick marks will still appear, unless
      other relevant Plot attributes indicate that they should
      not). The default behaviour is to draw the border if tick marks
      and numerical labels will be drawn around the edges of the

   Index of current FITS card in a FitsChan

   \sstdescription{
      This attribute gives the index of the {\tt{"}}current{\tt{"}} FITS header card
      within a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}, the first card having an index of 1. The
      choice of current card affects the behaviour of functions that
      access the contents of the FitsChan, such as \htmlref{astDelFits}{astDelFits},
      \htmlref{astFindFits}{astFindFits} and \htmlref{astPutFits}{astPutFits}.

      A value assigned to Card will position the FitsChan at any
      desired point, so that a particular card within it can be
      accessed. Alternatively, the value of Card may be enquired in
      order to determine the current position of a FitsChan.

      The default value of Card is 1. This means that clearing
      this attribute (using \htmlref{astClear}{astClear}) effectively {\tt{"}}rewinds{\tt{"}} the
      FitsChan, so that the first card is accessed next.  If Card is
      set to a value which exceeds the total number of cards in the
      FitsChan (as given by its Ncards attribute), it is regarded as
      pointing at the {\tt{"}}end-of-file{\tt{"}}. In this case, the value returned

   Combine Plot clipping limits using a boolean OR?

      This attribute controls how the clipping limits specified for
      each axis of a \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} (using the \htmlref{astClip}{astClip} function) are
      combined. This, in turn, determines which parts of the graphical
      output will be visible.

      If the ClipOp attribute of a Plot is zero (the default),
      graphical output is visible only if it satisfies the clipping
      limits on all the axes of the clipping \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} (a boolean

      satisfies the clipping limits on one or more axes (a boolean
      OR).

      An important use of this attribute is to allow areas of a Plot
      to be left clear (e.g. as a background for some text). To
      achieve this, the lower and upper clipping bounds supplied to
      astClip should be reversed, and the ClipOp attribute of the

      This attribute determines the colour index used when drawing

      using colour index 2. The synonym {\tt{"}}Color{\tt{"}} may also be used.

      The range of integer colour indices available and their
      appearance is determined by the underlying graphics system. The
      default behaviour is for all graphical elements to be drawn
      using the default colour index supplied by this graphics system

   System for encoding Objects as FITS headers
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This attribute specifies the encoding system to use when AST
      Objects are stored as FITS header cards in a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}. It
      affects the behaviour of the \htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite} and \htmlref{astRead}{astRead} functions when
      they are used to transfer any AST \htmlref{Object}{Object} to or from an external
      representation consisting of FITS header cards (i.e. whenever a
      write or read operation is performed using a FitsChan as the I/O
      \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}).

      There are several ways (conventions) by which coordinate system
      information may be represented in the form of FITS headers and
      the Encoding attribute is used to specify which of these should
      be used. The encoding options available are outlined in the
      {\tt{"}}Encodings Available{\tt{"}} section below, and in more detail in the
      sections which follow.

      Encoding systems differ in the range of possible Objects
      (e.g. classes) they can represent, in the restrictions they
      place on these Objects (e.g. compatibility with some
      externally-defined coordinate system model) and in the number of
      Objects that can be stored together in any particular set of
      FITS header cards (e.g. multiple Objects, or only a single
      Object). The choice of encoding also affects the range of
      external applications which can potentially read and interpret
      the FITS header cards produced.

      The encoding options available are not necessarily mutually
      exclusive, and it may sometimes be possible to store multiple
      Objects (or the same Object several times) using different
      encodings within the same set of FITS header cards. This
      possibility increases the likelihood of other applications being
      able to read and interpret the information.

      By default, a FitsChan will attempt to determine which encoding
      system is already in use, and will set the default Encoding
      value accordingly (so that subsequent I/O operations adopt the
      same conventions). It does this by looking for certain critical
      FITS keywords which only occur in particular encodings. For
      details of how this works, see the {\tt{"}}Choice of Default Encoding{\tt{"}}
      section below. If you wish to ensure that a particular encoding
      system is used, independently of any FITS cards already present,
      you should set an explicit Encoding value yourself.

         astrometric plate calibrations. The main advantages of this
         encoding are that FITS images which use it are widely available
         and it is understood by a number of important and

         M. Calabretta (A \& A, in preparation). The main advantages of
         this encoding are that it should be understood by any FITS-WCS
         compliant application and is likely to be adopted widely for
         FITS data in future. At present, however, it suffers from the
         disadvantage that the FITS-WCS standard is only a draft (and is
         not stable), so it cannot yet be recommended for regular
         use. For further details, see the section {\tt{"}}The FITS-WCS

         header cards using the conventions described in an earlier draft
         of the FITS world coordinate system paper by E.W. Greisen and
         M. Calabretta. This encoding uses a combination of CDELTi and
         PCiiijjj keywords to describe the scale and rotation of the pixel
         axes. This encoding is included to support existing data and
         software which uses these now superceded conventions. In general,
         the {\tt{"}}FITS-WCS{\tt{"}} encoding (which uses CDi\_j keywords to describe the
         scale and rotation) should be used in preference to {\tt{"}}FITS-PC{\tt{"}}.

         {\tt{"}}FITS-IRAF{\tt{"}}: Encodes coordinate system information in FITS

         {\tt{"}}World Coordinate Systems Representations Within the FITS
         Format{\tt{"}} by R.J. Hanisch and D.G. Wells, 1988.  This encoding is
         currently employed by the IRAF data analysis facility, so its
         use will facilitate data exchange with IRAF. Its main advantages
         are that it is a stable convention which approximates to a
         subset of the propsed FITS-WCS encoding (above). This makes it
         suitable as an interim method for storing coordinate system
         information in FITS headers until the FITS-WCS encoding becomes
         stable. Since many datasets currently use the FITS-IRAF
         encoding, conversion of data from FITS-IRAF to the final form of
         FITS-WCS is likely to be well supported.

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}FITS-AIPS{\tt{"}}: Encodes coordinate system information in FITS

         CROTAi keuwords to desribe the scale and rotation of each axis.
         These conventions have been superceded but are still widely used.

         convention which is private to the AST library (but adheres to
         the general FITS standard) and which uses FITS keywords that
         will not clash with other encoding systems. The main advantages
         of this are that any class of AST Object may be encoded, and any
         (reasonable) number of Objects may be stored sequentially in the
         same FITS header. This makes FITS headers an almost loss-less
         communication path for passing AST Objects between applications
         (although all such applications must, of course, make use of the
         AST library to interpret the information). For further details,

   \sstdiytopic{
      Choice of Default Encoding
   }{
      If the Encoding attribute of a FitsChan is not set, the default
      value it takes is determined by the presence of certain critical
      FITS keywords within the FitsChan. The sequence of decisions
      used to arrive at the default value is as follows:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         If the FitsChan contains any keywords beginning with the
         string {\tt{"}}BEGAST{\tt{"}}, then NATIVE encoding is used,

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
         {\tt{"}}PCiiijjj{\tt{"}}, where {\tt{"}}i{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}j{\tt{"}} are single digits, then
         FITS-PC encoding is used,

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
         {\tt{"}}CDiiijjj{\tt{"}}, where {\tt{"}}i{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}j{\tt{"}} are single digits, then
         FITS-IRAF encoding is used,

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
         {\tt{"}}CDi\_j{\tt{"}}, and at least one of RADECSYS, PROJPi, or CjVALi
         where {\tt{"}}i{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}j{\tt{"}} are single digits, then FITS-IRAF encoding is
         used.

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains any keywords of the form
         PROJPi, CjVALi or RADECSYS, where {\tt{"}}i{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}j{\tt{"}} are single digits,
         then FITS-PC encoding is used.

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
         CROTAi, where {\tt{"}}i{\tt{"}} is a single digit, then FITS-AIPS encoding is
         used.

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
         CDELTi, where {\tt{"}}i{\tt{"}} is a single digit, then FITS-PC encoding is
         used.

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
         CRVALi, where {\tt{"}}i{\tt{"}} is a single digit, then FITS-WCS encoding is
         used.

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains the {\tt{"}}PLTRAH{\tt{"}} keyword, then
         DSS encoding is used,

         \sstitem
         Otherwise, if none of these conditions is met (as would be the
         case when using an empty FitsChan), then NATIVE encoding is
         used.

      }
      Setting an explicit value for the Encoding attribute always
      over-rides this default behaviour.

      Note that when writing information to a FitsChan, the choice of
      encoding will depend greatly on the type of application you
      expect to be reading the information in future. If you do not
      know this, there may sometimes be an advantage in writing the
      information several times, using a different encoding on each
      occasion.
   }
   \sstdiytopic{
      The DSS Encoding
   }{
      The DSS encoding uses FITS header cards to store a multi-term
      polynomial which relates pixel positions on a digitised
      photographic plate to celestial coordinates (right ascension and
      declination). This encoding may only be used to store a single
      AST Object in any set of FITS header cards, and that Object must
      be a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} which conforms to the STScI/DSS coordinate system
      model (this means the \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which relates its base and current
      Frames must include either a \htmlref{DssMap}{DssMap} or a \htmlref{WcsMap}{WcsMap} with type
      AST\_\_TAN).

      When reading a DSS encoded Object (using astRead), the FitsChan
      concerned must initially be positioned at the first card (its
      \htmlref{Card}{Card} attribute must equal 1) and the result of the read, if
      successful, will always be a pointer to a FrameSet. The base
      \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} of this FrameSet represents DSS pixel coordinates, and the
      current Frame represents DSS celestial coordinates. Such a read
      is always destructive and causes the FITS header cards required
      for the construction of the FrameSet to be removed from the
      FitsChan, which is then left positioned at the {\tt{"}}end-of-file{\tt{"}}. A
      subsequent read using the same encoding will therefore not
      return another FrameSet, even if the FitsChan is rewound.

      When astWrite is used to store a FrameSet using DSS encoding,
      an attempt is first made to simplify the FrameSet to see if it
      conforms to the DSS model.  Specifically, the current Frame must
      be a default FK5 \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}; the projection must be a tangent plane
      (gnomonic) projection with polynomial corrections conforming to
      DSS requirements, and north must be parallel to the second base
      Frame axis.

      If the simplification process succeeds, a description of the
      FrameSet is written to the FitsChan using appropriate DSS FITS
      header cards. The base Frame of the FrameSet is used to form the
      DSS pixel coordinate system and the current Frame gives the DSS
      celestial coordinate system.  A successful write operation will
      over-write any existing DSS encoded data in the FitsChan, but
      will not affect other (non-DSS) header cards. If a destructive
      read of a DSS encoded Object has previously occurred, then an
      attempt will be made to store the FITS header cards back in
      their original locations.

      If an attempt to simplify a FrameSet to conform to the DSS model
      fails (or if the Object supplied is not a FrameSet), then no
      data will be written to the FitsChan and astWrite will return
      zero. No error will result.
   }
   \sstdiytopic{
      The FITS-WCS Encoding
   }{
      The FITS-WCS convention uses FITS header cards to describe the
      relationship between pixels in an image (not necessarily
      2-dimensional) and one or more related {\tt{"}}world coordinate systems{\tt{"}}.
      Often, although not necessarily, one of these systems will be a
      celestial coordinate system, in which case the sequence of
      transformations which convert between the various intermediate
      coordinate systems will include a {\tt{"}}sky projection{\tt{"}} (e.g. as
      implemented by a WcsMap).  The FITS-WCS encoding may only be
      used to store a single AST Object in any set of FITS header
      cards, and that Object must be a FrameSet which conforms to the
      FITS-WCS model (the FrameSet may, however, contain multiple Frames).

      When reading a FITS-WCS encoded Object (using astRead), the FitsChan
      concerned must initially be positioned at the first card (its
      Card attribute must equal 1) and the result of the read, if
      successful, will always be a pointer to a FrameSet. The base
      Frame of this FrameSet represents FITS-WCS pixel coordinates,
      and the current Frame represents the physical coordinate system
      described by the FITS-WCS primary axis descriptions. If
      secondary axis descriptions are also present, then the FrameSet
      may contain additional (non-current) Frames which represent
      these.  Such a read is always destructive and causes the FITS
      header cards required for the construction of the FrameSet to be
      removed from the FitsChan, which is then left positioned at the
      {\tt{"}}end-of-file{\tt{"}}. A subsequent read using the same encoding will
      therefore not return another FrameSet, even if the FitsChan is
      rewound.

      When astWrite is used to store a FrameSet using FITS-WCS
      encoding, an attempt is first made to simplify the FrameSet to
      see if it conforms to the FITS-WCS model. If this simplification
      process succeeds (as it often should, as the model is reasonably
      flexible), a description of the FrameSet is written to the
      FitsChan using appropriate FITS header cards. The base Frame of
      the FrameSet is used to form the FITS-WCS pixel coordinate
      system and the current Frame gives the physical coordinate
      system to be described by the FITS-WCS primary axis
      descriptions.  Any additional Frames in the FrameSet may be used
      to construct secondary axis descriptions, where appropriate.

      A successful write operation will over-write any existing
      FITS-WCS encoded data in the FitsChan, but will not affect other
      (non-FITS-WCS) header cards. If a destructive read of a FITS-WCS
      encoded Object has previously occurred, then an attempt will be
      made to store the FITS header cards back in their original
      locations. Otherwise, the new cards will be inserted following
      any other FITS-WCS related header cards present or, failing
      that, in front of the current card (as given by the Card
      attribute).

      If an attempt to simplify a FrameSet to conform to the FITS-WCS
      model fails (or if the Object supplied is not a FrameSet), then
      no data will be written to the FitsChan and astWrite will
      return zero. No error will result.

      Note that this encoding is provided mainly as an interim measure to
      provide a more stable alternative to the FITS-WCS encoding until the
      FITS standard for encoding WCS information is finalised.  The name
      {\tt{"}}FITS-IRAF{\tt{"}} indicates the general keyword conventions used and does
      not imply that this encoding will necessarily support all features of
      the WCS scheme used by IRAF software. Nevertheless, an attempt has
      been made to support a few such features where they are known to be
      used by important sources of data.

      When writing a FrameSet using the FITS-IRAF encoding, axis rotations
      are specified by a matrix of FITS keywords of the form {\tt{"}}CDi\_j{\tt{"}}, where
      {\tt{"}}i{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}j{\tt{"}} are single digits. The alternative form {\tt{"}}CDiiijjj{\tt{"}}, which
      is also in use, is recognised when reading an Object, but is never
      written.

      In addition, the experimental IRAF {\tt{"}}ZPX{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}TNX{\tt{"}} sky projections will
      be accepted when reading, but will never be written (the corresponding
      FITS {\tt{"}}ZPN{\tt{"}} or {\tt{"}}TAN{\tt{"}} projection being used instead). However, there
      are restrictions on the use of these experimental projections. For
      {\tt{"}}ZPX{\tt{"}}, longitude and latitude correction surfaces (appearing as
      {\tt{"}}lngcor{\tt{"}} or {\tt{"}}latcor{\tt{"}} terms in the IRAF-specific {\tt{"}}WAT{\tt{"}} keywords) are
      not supported. For {\tt{"}}TNX{\tt{"}} projections, only cubic surfaces encoded as
      simple polynomials with {\tt{"}}half cross-terms{\tt{"}} are supported. If an
      un-usable {\tt{"}}TNX{\tt{"}} or {\tt{"}}ZPX{\tt{"}} projection is encountered while reading
      from a FitsChan, a simpler form of TAN or ZPN projection is used
      which ignores the unsupported features and may therefore be
      inaccurate. If this happens, a warning message is added to the
      contents of the FitsChan as a set of cards using the keyword {\tt{"}}ASTWARN{\tt{"}}.

      You should not normally attempt to mix the FITS-IRAF, FITS-WCS,
      FITS-AIPS or FITS-PC encodings within the same FitsChan, since there
      is a risk that keyword clashes may occur.

   \sstdiytopic{
      The NATIVE Encoding
   }{
      The NATIVE encoding may be used to store a description of any
      class of AST Object in the form of FITS header cards, and (for
      most practical purposes) any number of these Object descriptions
      may be stored within a single set of FITS cards. If multiple
      Object descriptions are stored, they are written and read
      sequentially. The NATIVE encoding makes use of unique FITS
      keywords which are designed not to clash with keywords that have
      already been used for other purposes (if a potential clash is
      detected, an alternative keyword is constructed to avoid the
      clash).

      When reading a NATIVE encoded object from a FitsChan (using
      astRead), FITS header cards are read, starting at the current
      card (as determined by the Card attribute), until the start of
      the next Object description is found. This description is then
      read and converted into an AST Object, for which a pointer is
      returned. Such a read is always destructive and causes all the
      FITS header cards involved in the Object description to be
      removed from the FitsChan, which is left positioned at the
      following card.

      The Object returned may be of any class, depending on the
      description that was read, and other AST routines may be used to
      validate it (for example, by examining its \htmlref{Class}{Class} or \htmlref{ID}{ID} attribute
      using astGetC). If further NATIVE encoded Object descriptions
      exist in the FitsChan, subsequent calls to astRead will return
      the Objects they describe in sequence (and destroy their
      descriptions) until no more remain between the current card and
      the {\tt{"}}end-of-file{\tt{"}}.

      When astWrite is used to write an Object using NATIVE encoding,
      a description of the Object is inserted immediately before the
      current card (as determined by the Card attribute).  Multiple
      Object descriptions may be written in this way and are stored
      separately (and sequentially if the Card attribute is not
      modified between the writes). A write operation using the NATIVE
      encoding does not over-write previously written Object
      descriptions. Note, however, that subsequent behaviour is
      undefined if an Object description is written inside a
      previously-written description, so this should be avoided.

      When an Object is written to a FitsChan using NATIVE encoding,
      astWrite should (barring errors) always transfer data and
      return a value of 1.

      This attribute is used to qualify the celestial coordinate

      when the coordinates are known to be correct. Often, this will
      be the date of observation.

      The Epoch value is important in cases where the coordinates of
      sources may change with time. Possible reasons for this include:
      (i) changing aberration of light caused by the observer's
      velocity (e.g. due to the Earth's motion around the Sun), (ii)
      changing gravitational deflection by the Sun due to changes in
      the observer's position with time, (iii) fictitious motion due
      to rotation of non-inertial coordinate systems (e.g. the old FK4
      system), and (iv) proper motion of the source itself (although
      this last effect is not handled by the SkyFrame class because it
      affects individual sources rather than the coordinate system as
      a whole).

      This attribute is used to qualify those celestial coordinate
      systems described by a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} which are notionally based on
      the ecliptic (the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun)
      and/or the Earth's equator.

      Both of these planes are in motion and their positions are
      difficult to specify precisely. In practice, therefore, a model
      ecliptic and/or equator are used instead. These, together with
      the point on the sky that defines the coordinate origin (the
      intersection of the two planes termed the {\tt{"}}mean equinox{\tt{"}}) move
      with time according to some model which removes the more rapid
      fluctuations. The SkyFrame class supports both the old FK4 and
      the current FK5 models.

      The position of a fixed source expressed in any of these
      coordinate systems will appear to change with time due to
      movement of the coordinate system itself (rather than motion of
      the source).  Such coordinate systems must therefore be
      qualified by a moment in time (the {\tt{"}}epoch of the mean equinox{\tt{"}}
      or {\tt{"}}equinox{\tt{"}} for short) which allows the position of the model
      coordinate system on the sky to be determined. This is the role
      of the Equinox attribute.

      The Equinox attribute is stored as a Modified Julian Date, but
      when setting or getting its value you may use the same formats

      This attribute gives the number of significant decimal digits to

      By default, a positive value is used which results in no loss of
      information, assuming that the value's precision is double.
      Usually, this causes no problems.

      However, to adhere strictly to the recommendations of the FITS
      standard, the width of the formatted value (including sign,
      decimal point and exponent) ought not to be more than 20
      characters. If you are concerned about this, you should set
      FitsDigits to a negative value, such as -15. In this case, the
      absolute value ($+$15) indicates the maximum number of significant
      digits to use, but the actual number used may be fewer than this
      to ensure that the FITS recommendations are satisfied. When

   \sstdescription{
      This attribute specifies the projection parameter values to be
      used by a \htmlref{WcsMap}{WcsMap} when implementing a FITS-WCS sky projection.
      Each PV attribute name should include two integers, j and m,
      separated by an underscore. The axis index is specified
      by j, and should be in the range 1 to 99. The parameter number
      is specified by m, and should be in the range 0 to 99. For
      example, {\tt{"}}PV2\_1=45.0{\tt{"}} would specify a value for projection
      parameter 1 of axis 2 in a WcsMap.

      These projection parameters correspond exactly to the values
      stored using the FITS-WCS keywords {\tt{"}}PV1\_1{\tt{"}}, {\tt{"}}PV1\_2{\tt{"}}, etc. This
      means that projection parameters which correspond to angles must
      be given in degrees (despite the fact that the angular
      coordinates and other attributes used by a WcsMap are in
      radians).

      The set of projection parameters used by a WcsMap depends on the
      type of projection, which is determined by its \htmlref{WcsType}{WcsType}
      parameter.  Most projections either do not require projection
      parameters, or use parameters 1 and 2 associated with the latitude
      axis. You should consult the FITS-WCS paper for details.

      Some projection parameters have default values (as defined in
      the FITS-WCS paper) which apply if no explicit value is given.
      Currently, these defaults are all zero. You may omit setting a
      value for these {\tt{"}}optional{\tt{"}} parameters and the default will
      apply. Some projection parameters, however, have no default and
      a value must be explicitly supplied.  This is most conveniently
      done using the {\tt{"}}options{\tt{"}} argument of \htmlref{astWcsMap}{astWcsMap} (q.v.) when a WcsMap
      is first created. An error will result when a WcsMap is used to
      transform coordinates if any of its required projection
      parameters has not been set and lacks a default value.

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}FK4{\tt{"}}: The old FK4 (barycentric) equatorial coordinate system,
         which should be qualified by an \htmlref{Equinox}{Equinox} value. The underlying
         model on which this is based is non-inertial and rotates slowly
         with time, so for accurate work FK4 coordinate systems should
         also be qualified by an \htmlref{Epoch}{Epoch} value.

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}FK4-NO-E{\tt{"}} or {\tt{"}}FK4\_NO\_E{\tt{"}}: The old FK4 (barycentric) equatorial
         system but without the {\tt{"}}E-terms of aberration{\tt{"}} (e.g. some radio
         catalogues). This coordinate system should also be qualified by
         both an Equinox and an Epoch value.

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}FK5{\tt{"}} or {\tt{"}}EQUATORIAL{\tt{"}}: The modern FK5 (barycentric) equatorial
         coordinate system. This should be qualified by an Equinox value.

         \sstitem
         {\tt{"}}GAPPT{\tt{"}}, {\tt{"}}GEOCENTRIC{\tt{"}} or {\tt{"}}APPARENT{\tt{"}}: The geocentric apparent
         equatorial coordinate system, which gives the apparent positions
         of sources relative to the true plane of the Earth's equator and
         the equinox (the coordinate origin) at a time specified by the
         qualifying Epoch value. (Note that no Equinox is needed to
         qualify this coordinate system because no model {\tt{"}}mean equinox{\tt{"}}
         is involved.)  These coordinates give the apparent right
         ascension and declination of a source for a specified date of
         observation, and therefore form an approximate basis for
         pointing a telescope. Note, however, that they are applicable to
         a fictitious observer at the Earth's centre, and therefore
         ignore such effects as atmospheric refraction and the (normally
         much smaller) aberration of light due to the rotational velocity
         of the Earth's surface.  Geocentric apparent coordinates are
         derived from the standard FK5 (J2000.0) barycentric coordinates
         by taking account of the gravitational deflection of light by
         the Sun (usually small), the aberration of light caused by the
         motion of the Earth's centre with respect to the barycentre
         (larger), and the precession and nutation of the Earth's spin
         axis (normally larger still).

         {\tt{"}}GALACTIC{\tt{"}}: Galactic coordinates (IAU 1958).

      create a new Object from its textual representation.

      Normally, when you use a Channel, you should provide {\tt{"}}source{\tt{"}}
      and {\tt{"}}sink{\tt{"}} functions which connect it to an external data store
      by reading and writing the resulting text. By default, however,

      in the resulting CmpFrame (those of the first Frame, followed by

      Survey (DSS) astrometric plate solution.

      The input coordinates are pixel numbers along the first and
      second dimensions of an image, where the centre of the first
      pixel is located at (1,1) and the spacing between pixel centres
      is unity.

      The output coordinates are right ascension and declination in
      radians. The celestial coordinate system used (FK4, FK5, etc.)
      is unspecified, and will usually be indicated by appropriate

}{
   I/O Channel using FITS header cards to represent Objects
}{
   \sstdescription{
      A FitsChan is a specialised form of \htmlref{Channel}{Channel} which supports I/O
      operations involving the use of FITS (Flexible Image Transport
      \htmlref{System}{System}) header cards. Writing an \htmlref{Object}{Object} to a FitsChan (using
      \htmlref{astWrite}{astWrite}) will, if the Object is suitable, generate a
      description of that Object composed of FITS header cards, and
      reading from a FitsChan will create a new Object from its FITS
      header card description.

      While a FitsChan is active, it represents a buffer which may
      contain zero or more 80-character {\tt{"}}header cards{\tt{"}} conforming to
      FITS conventions. Any sequence of FITS-conforming header cards
      may be stored, apart from the {\tt{"}}END{\tt{"}} card whose existence is
      merely implied.  The cards may be accessed in any order by using
      the FitsChan's integer \htmlref{Card}{Card} attribute, which identifies a {\tt{"}}current{\tt{"}}
      card, to which subsequent operations apply. Searches
      based on keyword may be performed (using \htmlref{astFindFits}{astFindFits}), new
      cards may be inserted (\htmlref{astPutFits}{astPutFits}) and existing ones may be
      deleted (\htmlref{astDelFits}{astDelFits}).

      When you create a FitsChan, you have the option of specifying
      {\tt{"}}source{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}sink{\tt{"}} functions which connect it to external data
      stores by reading and writing FITS header cards. If you provide
      a source function, it is used to fill the FitsChan with header
      cards when it is created. If you do not provide a source
      function, the FitsChan remains empty until you explicitly enter
      data into it (e.g. using astPutFits or astWrite). If you
      provide a sink function, it is used to deliver any remaining
      contents of a FitsChan to an external data store when the
      FitsChan is deleted. If you do not provide a sink function, any
      header cards remaining when the FitsChan is deleted will be
      lost, so you should arrange to extract them first if necessary
      (e.g. using astFindFits or \htmlref{astRead}{astRead}).

      Coordinate system information may be described using FITS header
      cards using several different conventions, termed
      {\tt{"}}encodings{\tt{"}}. When an AST Object is written to (or read from) a
      FitsChan, the value of the FitsChan's \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} attribute
      determines how the Object is converted to (or from) a
      description involving FITS header cards. In general, different
      encodings will result in different sets of header cards to
      describe the same Object. Examples of encodings include the DSS
      encoding (based on conventions used by the STScI Digitised Sky
      Survey data), the FITS-WCS encoding (based on a proposed FITS
      standard) and the NATIVE encoding (a near loss-less way of
      storing AST Objects in FITS headers).

      The available encodings differ in the range of Objects they can
      represent, in the number of Object descriptions that can coexist
      in the same FitsChan, and in their accessibility to other
      (external) astronomy applications (see the Encoding attribute
      for details). Encodings are not necessarily mutually exclusive
      and it may sometimes be possible to describe the same Object in
      several ways within a particular set of FITS header cards by
      using several different encodings.

      The detailed behaviour of astRead and astWrite, when used with
      a FitsChan, depends on the encoding in use. In general, however,
      all use of astRead is destructive, so that FITS header cards
      are consumed in the process of reading an Object, and are
      removed from the FitsChan.

      If the encoding in use allows only a single Object description
      to be stored in a FitsChan (e.g. the DSS, FITS-WCS and FITS-IRAF
      encodings), then write operations using astWrite will
      over-write any existing Object description using that
      encoding. Otherwise (e.g. the NATIVE encoding), multiple Object
      descriptions are written sequentially and may later be read
      back in the same sequence.

   Set of inter-related coordinate systems
}{
   \sstdescription{
      A FrameSet consists of a set of one or more Frames (which
      describe coordinate systems), connected together by Mappings
      (which describe how the coordinate systems are inter-related). A
      FrameSet makes it possible to obtain a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} between any pair
      of these Frames (i.e. to convert between any of the coordinate
      systems which it describes).  The individual Frames are
      identified within the FrameSet by an integer index, with Frames
      being numbered consecutively from one as they are added to the
      FrameSet.

      Every FrameSet has a {\tt{"}}base{\tt{"}} \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} and a {\tt{"}}current{\tt{"}} Frame (which
      are allowed to be the same). Any of the Frames may be nominated
      to hold these positions, and the choice is determined by the
      values of the FrameSet's \htmlref{Base}{Base} and \htmlref{Current}{Current} attributes, which hold
      the indices of the relevant Frames.  By default, the first Frame
      added to a FrameSet is its base Frame, and the last one added is
      its current Frame.

      The base Frame describes the {\tt{"}}native{\tt{"}} coordinate system of
      whatever the FrameSet is used to calibrate (e.g. the pixel
      coordinates of an image) and the current Frame describes the
      {\tt{"}}apparent{\tt{"}} coordinate system in which it should be viewed
      (e.g. displayed, etc.). Any further Frames represent a library
      of alternative coordinate systems, which may be selected by
      making them current.

      When a FrameSet is used in a context that requires a Frame,
      (e.g. obtaining its \htmlref{Title}{Title} value, or number of axes), the current
      Frame is used. A FrameSet may therefore be used in place of its
      current Frame in most situations.

      When a FrameSet is used in a context that requires a Mapping,
      the Mapping used is the one between its base Frame and its
      current Frame. Thus, a FrameSet may be used to convert {\tt{"}}native{\tt{"}}
      coordinates into {\tt{"}}apparent{\tt{"}} ones, and vice versa. Like any
      Mapping, a FrameSet may also be inverted (see \htmlref{astInvert}{astInvert}), which
      has the effect of interchanging its base and current Frames and
      hence of reversing the Mapping between them.

      A LutMap is a specialised form of \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which transforms

      lookup table.

      Each input coordinate value is first scaled to give the index of
      an entry in the table by subtracting a starting value (the input
      coordinate corresponding to the first table entry) and dividing
      by an increment (the difference in input coordinate value
      between adjacent table entries).

      The resulting index will usually contain a fractional part, so
      the output coordinate value is then generated by interpolating
      linearly between the appropriate entries in the table. If the
      index lies outside the range of the table, linear extrapolation
      is used based on the two nearest entries (i.e. the two entries
      at the start or end of the table, as appropriate).

      If the lookup table entries increase or decrease monotonically,
      then the inverse transformation may also be performed.

   Provide facilities for graphical output

   \sstdescription{
      This class provides facilities for producing graphical output.
      A Plot is a specialised form of \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}, in which the base
      \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} describes a {\tt{"}}graphical{\tt{"}} coordinate system and is
      associated with a rectangular plotting area in the underlying
      graphics system. This plotting area is where graphical output
      appears. It is defined when the Plot is created.

      The current Frame of a Plot describes a {\tt{"}}physical{\tt{"}} coordinate
      system, which is the coordinate system in which plotting
      operations are specified. The results of each plotting operation
      are automatically transformed into graphical coordinates so as
      to appear in the plotting area (subject to any clipping which
      may be in effect).

      Because the \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} between physical and graphical coordinates
      may often be non-linear, or even discontinuous, most plotting
      does not result in simple straight lines. The basic plotting
      element is therefore not a straight line, but a geodesic curve
      (see \htmlref{astCurve}{astCurve} and \htmlref{astPolyCurve}{astPolyCurve}). A Plot also provides facilities for
      drawing markers or symbols (\htmlref{astMark}{astMark}), text (\htmlref{astText}{astText}) and grid lines
      (\htmlref{astGridLine}{astGridLine}). It is also possible to draw curvilinear axes with
      optional coordinate grids (\htmlref{astGrid}{astGrid}).
      A range of Plot attributes is available to allow precise control
      over the appearance of graphical output produced by these
      functions.

      You may select different physical coordinate systems in which to
      plot (including the native graphical coordinate system itself)
      by selecting different Frames as the current Frame of a Plot,
      using its \htmlref{Current}{Current} attribute.  You may also set up clipping (see
      \htmlref{astClip}{astClip}) to limit the extent of any plotting you perform, and
      this may be done in any of the coordinate systems associated
      with the Plot, not necessarily the one you are plotting in.

      Like any FrameSet, a Plot may also be used as a Frame. In this
      case, it behaves like its current Frame, which describes the
      physical coordinate system.

      When used as a Mapping, a Plot describes the inter-relation
      between graphical coordinates (its base Frame) and physical
      coordinates (its current Frame).  It differs from a normal
      FrameSet, however, in that an attempt to transform points which
      lie in clipped areas of the Plot will result in bad coordinate
      values (AST\_\_BAD).

   Implement a FITS-WCS sky projection
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This class is used to represent sky coordinate projections as
      described in the (draft) FITS world coordinate system (FITS-WCS)
      paper by E.W. Griesen and M. Calabretta (A \& A, in preparation).
      This paper defines a set of functions, or sky projections, which
      transform longitude-latitude pairs representing spherical
      celestial coordinates into corresponding pairs of Cartesian
      coordinates (and vice versa).

      A WcsMap is a specialised form of \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} which implements these
      sky projections (all of those in the FITS-WCS paper are
      supported) and applies them to a specified pair of coordinates.
      Using the FITS-WCS terminology, this transformation is between
      {\tt{"}}native spherical{\tt{"}} and {\tt{"}}relative physical{\tt{"}} coordinates.  These
      coordinates may, optionally, be embedded in a space with more
      than two dimensions, the remaining coordinates being copied
      unchanged. Note, however, that for consistency with other AST
      facilities, a WcsMap handles coordinates that represent angles
      in radians (rather than the degrees used by FITS-WCS).

      The type of FITS-WCS projection to be used and the coordinates
      (axes) to which it applies are specified when a WcsMap is first
      created. The projection type may subsequently be determined
      using the \htmlref{WcsType}{WcsType} attribute and the coordinates on which it acts
      may be determined using the \htmlref{WcsAxis(lonlat)}{WcsAxislonlat} attribute.

      Each WcsMap also allows up to 99 {\tt{"}}projection parameters{\tt{"}} to be
      associated with each axis. These specify the precise form of the
      projection, and are accessed using \htmlref{PVj\_m}{PVj_m} attribute, where {\tt{"}}j{\tt{"}} is
      the integer axis index (starting at 1), and m is an integer
      {\tt{"}}parameter index{\tt{"}} in the range 0 to 99. The number of projection
      parameters required by each projection, and their meanings, are
      dependent upon the projection type (most projections either do not
      use any projection parameters, or use parameters 1 and 2 associated
      with the latitude axis). Before creating a WcsMap you should consult
      the FITS-WCS paper for details of which projection parameters are
      required, and which have defaults. When creating the WcsMap, you must
      explicitly set values for all those required projection parameters
      which do not have defaults defined in this paper.

\section{\xlabel{changes_and_new_features}\label{ss:changes}Changes and New Features}

\subsection{Changes Introduced in V1.1}

The following describes the most significant changes which occurred in
the AST library between versions V1.0 and V1.1 (not the most recent
version):

\begin{enumerate}

\item A new ``How To\ldots'' section (\secref{ss:howto}) has been
added to this document. It contains simple recipies for performing
commonly-required operations using AST.

\item A new \htmlref{astUnformat}{astUnformat} function has been provided to read formatted
coordinate values for the axes of a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}
(\secref{ss:unformattingaxisvalues}). In essence, this function is the
inverse of \htmlref{astFormat}{astFormat}. It may be used to decode user-supplied formatted
values representing coordinates, turning them into numerical values
for processing. Celestial coordinates may also be read using this
function (\secref{ss:unformattingskyaxisvalues}) and free-format input
is supported.

\item The Format attribute string used by a \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame} when formatting
celestial coordinate values now allows the degrees/hours field to be
omitted, so that celestial coordinates may be given in ({\em{e.g.}})
arc-minutes and/or arc-seconds
(\secref{ss:formattingskyaxisvalues}). As a result, the degrees/hours
field is no longer included by default.  A new ``t'' format specifier
has been introduced (see the Format attribute) to allow minutes and/or
seconds of time to be specified if required.

\item A new function \htmlref{astMapBox}{astMapBox} has been introduced. This allows you to
find the extent of a ``bounding box'' which just encloses another box
after it has been transformed by a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}. A typical use might be to
calculate the size which an image would have if it were transformed by
the Mapping.

\item A new class of \htmlref{Object}{Object}, the \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap}, has been introduced
(\secref{ss:intramaps}). This is a specialised form of Mapping which
encapsulates a privately-defined coordinate transformation function
({\em{e.g.}}\ written in C) so that it may be used like any other AST
Mapping. This allows you to create Mappings that perform any
conceivable coordinate transformation.

\item The internal integrity of a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} is now automatically
preserved whenever changes are made to any attributes which affect the
current Frame (either by setting or clearing their values). This is
accomplished by appropriately re-mapping the current Frame to account
for any change to the coordinate system which it represents
(\secref{ss:framesetintegrity}).

\item The internal structure of a FrameSet is now automatically tidied
to eliminate redundant nodes whenever any of its Frames is removed or
re-mapped. Automatic simplification of any compound Mappings which
result may also occur. The effect of this change is to prevent the
accumulation of unnecessary structure in FrameSets which are
repeatedly modified.

\item Some improvements have been made to the algorithms for
simplifying compound Mappings, as used by \htmlref{astSimplify}{astSimplify}.

\item The textual representation used for some Objects
({\em{i.e.}}\ when they are written to a \htmlref{Channel}{Channel}) has changed
slightly, but remains compatible with earlier versions of AST.

\item Interfaces to the internal functions and macros used by AST for
handling memory and error conditions are now provided {\em{via}} the
``ast.h'' header file. This is for the benefit of those writing
({\em{e.g.}}) new graphics interfaces for AST.

\item A problem has been fixed which could result when using \htmlref{astRead}{astRead}
to read FITS headers in which the CDELT value is zero. Previously,
this could produce a Mapping whose inverse transformation was not
defined and this could unnecessarily restrict the use to which it
could be put. The problem has been overcome by supplying a suitable
small CDELT value for FITS axes which have only a single pixel.

\item A bug has been fixed which could occasionally cause a \htmlref{MatrixMap}{MatrixMap}
to be used with the wrong \htmlref{Invert}{Invert} attribute value when it forms part of
a compound Mapping which is being simplified using astSimplify.


\item A problem has been fixed which could prevent tick marks being
drawn on a coordinate axis close to a singularity in the coordinate
system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Changes Introduced in V1.2}

The following describes the most significant changes which occurred in
the AST library between versions V1.1 and V1.2 (not the most recent
version):

\begin{enumerate}
\item A new function, \htmlref{astPolyCurve}{astPolyCurve}, has been introduced to allow more
efficient plotting of multiple geodesic curves
(\secref{ss:plottinggeodesics}).

\item A new set of functions, \htmlref{astResample$<$X$>$}{astResampleX}, has been introduced
to perform resampling of gridded data such as images
({\em{i.e.}}\ re-gridding) under the control of a geometrical
transformation specified by a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}.

\item The command-line options ``$-$pgp'' and ``$-$pgplot'', which
were previously synonymous when used with the ``\htmlref{ast\_link}{ast_link}'' and
``\htmlref{ast\_link\_adam}{ast_link_adam}'' commands, are no longer synonymous. The option
``$-$pgp'' now causes linking with the Starlink version of PGPLOT
(which uses GKS to generate its output), while ``$-$pgplot'' links
with the standard (or ``native'') version of PGPLOT.

\item The function \htmlref{astMapBox}{astMapBox} has been changed to execute more quickly,
although this has been achieved at the cost of some loss of robustness
when used with difficult Mappings.

\item A new value of ``FITS-IRAF'' has been introduced for the
\htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} attribute of a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan}. This new encoding provides an
interim solution to the problem of storing coordinate system
information in FITS headers, until the proposed new FITS-WCS standard
becomes stable.

\item When a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} is created from a set of FITS header cards (by
reading from a FitsChan using a ``foreign'' encoding), the base \htmlref{Frame}{Frame}
of the resulting FrameSet now has its \htmlref{Domain}{Domain} attribute set to
``GRID''. This reflects the fact that this Frame represents FITS data
grid coordinates (equivalent to FITS pixel coordinates---see
\secref{ss:domainconventions}). Previously, this Domain value was not
set.

\item \htmlref{astFindFits}{astFindFits} now ignores trailing spaces in its keyword template.

\item \htmlref{astPutFits}{astPutFits} now recognises ``D'' and ``d'' as valid exponent
characters in floating point numbers.

\item The FitsChan class is now more tolerant of common minor
violations of the FITS standard.

\item The FitsChan class now incorporates an improved test for the
linearity of Mappings, allowing more reliable conversion of AST data
into FITS (using ``foreign'' FITS encodings).

\item Some further improvements have been made to the algorithms for
simplifying compound Mappings, as used by \htmlref{astSimplify}{astSimplify}.

\item A new \htmlref{UnitRadius}{UnitRadius} attribute has been added to the \htmlref{SphMap}{SphMap}
class. This allows improved simplification of compound Mappings
(CmpMaps) involving SphMaps and typically improves performance when
handling FITS world coordinate information.

\item A \htmlref{MatrixMap}{MatrixMap} no longer propagates input coordinate values of
AST\_\_BAD automatically to all output coordinates. If certain output
coordinates do not depend on the affected input coordinate(s) because
the relevant matrix elements are zero, then they may now remain valid.

\item A minor bug has been corrected which could cause certain
projections which involve half the celestial sphere to produce valid
coordinates for the other (unprojected) half of the sphere as well.

\item A bug has been fixed which could occasionally cause \htmlref{astConvert}{astConvert}
to think that conversion between a \htmlref{CmpFrame}{CmpFrame} and another Frame was
possible when, in fact, it wasn't.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Changes Introduced in V1.3}

The following describes the most significant changes which occurred in
the AST library between versions V1.2 and V1.3 (not the most recent
version):

\begin{enumerate}
\item A new set of functions, \htmlref{astResample$<$X$>$}{astResampleX}, has been introduced to
provide	efficient resampling of gridded data, such as spectra and
images, under the control of a geometrical transformation specified by
a \htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping}. A variety of sub-pixel interpolation schemes are supported.

\item A new class, \htmlref{PcdMap}{PcdMap}, has been introduced. This is a specialised
form of Mapping which implements 2-dimensional pincushion or barrel
distortion.

\item A bug has been fixed which could cause a \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} to produce too
many digits when formatting floating point values for inclusion in a
FITS header if the numerical value was in the range -0.00099999\ldots
to -0.0001.

\item A bug has been fixed which could cause a FitsChan to lose the
comment associated with a string value in a FITS header.

\item A FitsChan now reports an error if it reads a FITS header which
identifies a non-standard sky projection (previously, this was
accepted without error and a Cartesian projection used instead).

\item A bug has been fixed which could prevent conversion between the
coordinate systems represented by two CmpFrames. This could only occur
if the CmpFrames contained a relatively large number of nested Frames.

%\item A bug has been fixed which could cause a program to crash if
%FrameSets were nested inside each other (for example, if one \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet}
%had another FrameSet added to it for use as a \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} or Mapping). The
%problem could only occur if the nested structure was loaded from a data
%c+
%file (using \htmlref{astRead}{astRead}).
%c-
%f+
%file (using AST\_READ).
%f-
%
\item Further improvements have been made to the simplification of
compound Mappings, including fixes for several bugs which could cause
indefinite looping or unwanted error messages.

\item Some memory leaks have been fixed.

\item A small number of documentation errors have been corrected.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Changes Introduced in V1.4}

The following describes the most significant changes which have occurred
in the AST library between versions V1.3 and V1.4 (not the most recent
version):

\begin{enumerate}
\item A new \htmlref{MathMap}{MathMap} class has been introduced. This is a form of
\htmlref{Mapping}{Mapping} that allows you to define coordinate transformations in a
flexible and transportable way using arithmetic operations and
mathematical functions similar to those available in C.

\item {\bf{WARNING---INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.}} Transformation functions
used with the \htmlref{IntraMap}{IntraMap} class (see, for example, \htmlref{astIntraReg}{astIntraReg}) now
require a ``this'' pointer as their first parameter. {\bf{Existing
implementations will not continue to work correctly with this version
of AST unless this parameter is added.}} There is no need for existing
software to make use of this pointer, but it must be present.

This change has been introduced so that transformation functions can gain
access to IntraMap attributes.

\item A new \htmlref{IntraFlag}{IntraFlag} attribute has been added to the IntraMap
class. This allows the transformation functions used by IntraMaps to
adapt to produce the required transformation on a per-IntraMap basis
(\secref{ss:intraflag}).

\item The \htmlref{Plot}{Plot} attributes MajTickLen and MinTickLen, which control the
length of major and minor tick marks on coordinate axes, may now be
subscripted using an axis number. This allows tick marks of different
lengths to be used on each axis. It also allows tick marks to be
suppressed on one axis only by setting the length to zero.

\item The value of the Plot attribute NumLab, which controls the
plotting of numerical labels on coordinate axes, no longer has any
effect on whether labelling of a coordinate grid is interior or
exterior (as controlled by the \htmlref{Labelling}{Labelling} attribute).

\item The \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} class now provides some support for the
IRAF-specific ``ZPX'' sky projection, which is converted transparently
into the equivalent FITS ``ZPN'' projection (see the description of the
\htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding} attribute for details).

\item The FitsChan class now recognises the coordinate system ``ICRS''
(International Celestial Reference \htmlref{System}{System}) as equivalent to
``FK5''. This is an interim measure and full support for the
(exceedingly small) difference between ICRS and FK5 will be added at a
future release.

Note that ``ICRS'' is not yet recognised as a coordinate system by other
classes such as \htmlref{SkyFrame}{SkyFrame}, so this change only facilitates the
importation of foreign data.

\item A bug in the FitsChan class has been fixed which could result in
longitude values being incorrect by 180 degrees when using cylindrical
sky projections, such as the FITS ``CAR'' projection.

\item A bug in the FitsChan class has been fixed which could result in
the FITS sky projection parameters ProjP(0) to ProjP(9) being
incorrectly named PROJP1 to PROJP10 when written out as FITS cards.

\item A bug in the FitsChan class has been fixed which could cause
confusion between the FITS-IRAF and FITS-WCS encoding schemes if both
a CD matrix and a PC matrix are erroneously present in a FITS header.

\item Some minor memory leaks have been fixed.

\item A small number of documentation errors have been corrected.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Changes Introduced in V1.5}

The following describes the most significant changes which have
occurred in the AST library between versions V1.4 and V1.5 (not the most
recent version):

\begin{enumerate}

\item The \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} class has been modified to support the latest draft
FITS WCS standard, described in the two papers ``Representation of world
coordinates in FITS'' (E.W.\,Greisen and M.\,Calabretta, dated 30th
November, 1999), and ``Representation of celestial coordinates in FITS''
(M.\,Calabretta and E.W.\,Greisen, dated 24th September, 1999). These are
available at
\htmladdnormallink{http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.html}
{http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.html}.

The FITS-WCS encoding now uses these updated conventions. The main
changes are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rotation and scaling of pixel axes is now represented by a matrix
of {\tt CDj\_i} keywords instead of a combination of {\tt PCjjjiii} and
{\tt CDELTj} keywords.
\item \htmlref{Projection}{Projection} parameters are now associated with particular axes and
are represented by {\tt PVi\_m} keywords instead of the {\tt PROJPm}
keywords.
\item The tangent plane projection (``TAN'') can now include optional 
polynomial correction terms.
\item An entire set of keywords must be supplied for each set of secondary 
axis descriptions, and each such keyword must finish with a single
character indicating which set it belongs to. This means that keywords
which previously occupied eight characters have been shorten to seven to
leave room for this extra character. Thus {\tt LONGPOLE} has become {\tt
LONPOLE} and {\tt RADECSYS} has become {\tt RADESYS}.
\end{itemize}

\item Two new encodings have been added to the FitsChan class:
\begin{description}

\item [FITS-PC] This encoding uses the conventions of the now superseded
FITS WCS paper by E.W.\,Greisen and M.\,Calabretta which used keywords
{\tt CDELTj} and {\tt PCjjjiii} to describe axis scaling and rotation.
These are the conventions which were used by the FITS-WCS encoding prior
to version 1.5 of AST. This encoding is provided to allow existing data
which use these conventions to be read. It should not in general be used
to create new data.

\item [FITS-AIPS] This encoding is based on the conventions described in the 
document ``Non-linear Coordinate Systems in AIPS'' by Eric W. Greisen
(revised 9th September, 1994 and available by ftp from fits.cv.nrao.edu
/fits/documents/wcs/aips27.ps.Z). This encoding uses {\tt CROTAi} and
{\tt CDELTi} keywords to describe axis rotation and scaling.

\end{description}

\item The FitsChan class now provides some support for the IRAF-specific 
``TNX'' sky projection, which is converted transparently into the
equivalent FITS ``TAN'' projection (see the description of the \htmlref{Encoding}{Encoding}
attribute for details).

\item FrameSets originally read from a DSS encoded FITS header can now be
written out using the FITS-WCS encoding (a TAN projection with correction
terms will be used) in addition to the DSS encoding. The reverse is also
possible: FrameSets originally read from a FITS-WCS encoded FITS header
and which use a TAN projection can now be written out using the DSS
encoding.

\item The algorithm used by the FitsChan class to verify that a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} 
conforms to the FITS-WCS model has been improved so that FrameSets
including more complex mixtures of parallel and serial Mappings
can be written out using the FITS-WCS encoding.

\item The FitsChan class has been changed so that long strings included in
the description of an \htmlref{Object}{Object} can be saved and restored without truncation
when using the NATIVE encoding. Previously, very long \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} titles,
mathematical expressions, {\em etc.} were truncated if they exceeded the
capacity of a single FITS header card. They are now split over several
header cards so that they can be restored without truncation. Note, this
facility is only available when using NATIVE encoding.

\item The FitsChan class has a new attribute called \htmlref{Warnings}{Warnings} which
can be used to select potentially dangerous conditions under which
warnings should be issued. These conditions include (for instance)
unsupported features within non-standard projections, missing keywords
for which default values will be used, {\em etc}.

\item The \htmlref{WcsMap}{WcsMap} class has been changed to support the changes made to the
FITS-WCS encoding in the FitsChan class:
\begin{itemize}
\item Projection parameters are now associated with a particular axis and
are specified using a new set of attributes called \htmlref{PVj\_m}{PVj_m}. Here, ``j'' is 
the index of an axis of WcsMap, and ``m'' is the index of the projection 
parameter.
\item The old attributes ProjP(0) to ProjP(9) are still available but are
now deprecated in favour of the new PVj\_m attributes. They are interpreted 
as aliases for PV(axlat)\_0 to PV(axlat)\_9, where ``axlat'' is the index of 
the latitude axis.
\item The GLS projection projection has been renamed as SFL, but the 
AST\_\_GLS type has been retained as an alias for AST\_\_SFL.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\xlabel{changes}\xlabel{list_of_most_recent_changes}Changes
Introduced in V1.6}

The following describes the most significant changes which have
occurred in the AST library between versions V1.5 and V1.6 (the
current version):

\begin{enumerate}

\item The FITS-WCS encoding used by the \htmlref{FitsChan}{FitsChan} class now includes the
WCSNAME keyword. When creating a \htmlref{FrameSet}{FrameSet} from FITS headers, the values of 
the WCSNAME keywords are now used as the \htmlref{Domain}{Domain} names for the corresponding 
Frames in the returned FrameSet. When writing a FrameSet to a FITS header
the Domain names of each \htmlref{Frame}{Frame} are stored in WCSNAME keywords in the
header. 

\item The FitsChan class now attempts to assigns a \htmlref{Title}{Title} to each Frame in
a FrameSet read using a foreign encoding. The Title is based on the Domain
name of the Frame. If the Frame has no Domain name, the default Title
supplied by the Frame class is retained.

\item The FitsChan class uses the comments associated with CTYPE
keywords as axis labels when reading a foreign encoding. This behaviour 
has been modified so that the default labels provided by the Frame class
are retained (instead of using the CTYPE comments) if any of the CTYPE 
comments are identical.

\item A new ``interpolation'' scheme identified by the symbolic constant
AST\_\_BLOCKAVE has been added to the AST\_RESAMPLE$<$X$>$ set of
functions. The new scheme calculates each output pixel value by finding
the mean of the input pixels in a box centred on the output pixel.

\end{enumerate}

Programs which are statically linked will need to be re-linked in
order to take advantage of these new facilities.
