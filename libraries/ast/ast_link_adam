#  Name:
#     ast_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Link an ADAM program with the AST library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This command should only be used when building Starlink ADAM programs
#     which use the AST library, in order to generate the correct arguments
#     to allow the ADAM ``alink'' command to link the program. The arguments
#     generated are written to standard output but may be substituted into
#     the ``alink'' command line in the standard UNIX way using backward
#     quotes (see below).
#
#     By default, it is assumed that you are building an ADAM program which
#     does not produce graphical output. However, switches are provided for
#     linking other types of program. This command should not be used when
#     building stand-alone (non-ADAM) programs. Use the ``ast_link'' command
#     instead.

#  Invocation:
#c     alink program.o -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam [switches]`
#f     alink program.f -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam [switches]`

#  Switches:
#     The following switches may optionally be given to this command to
#     modify its behaviour:
#
#     - ``-csla'': Requests that the program be linked so that it uses the C
#     implementation of the SLALIB positional astronomy library. By default,
#     the Fortran implementation is used (Starlink User Note SUN/67). Note
#     that both implementations of SLALIB use the same name (``libsla.a'')
#     for their library, so you must ensure that the directories searched to
#     resolve library references will result in the correct version of this
#     file (Fortran or C) being located.
#
#     - ``-myerr'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify how
#     error messages produced by the AST library should be delivered. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new error delivery system yourself and wish to provide your own
#     arguments for linking with it. By default, error messages are delivered
#     in the standard ADAM way via the EMS Error Message Service (Starlink
#     System Note SSN/4).
#
#     - ``-mygrf'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify which
#     graphics system is used to display output from the AST library. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new graphics system yourself and wish to provide your own arguments for
#     linking with it.
#
#     - ``-pgp'': Requests that the program be linked so that
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     Starlink version of the PGPLOT graphics package (which uses GKS
#     for its output). By default, no graphics package is linked and
#     this will result in an error at run time if AST routines are
#     invoked that attempt to generate graphical output.
#
#     - ``-pgplot'': Requests that the program be linked so that
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     standard (or ``native'') version of the PGPLOT graphics
#     package. By default, no graphics package is linked and this will
#     result in an error at run time if AST routines are invoked that
#     attempt to generate graphical output.

#  Examples:
#c     alink display.o -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -pgplot`
#c        Links an ADAM program ``display'' which uses the standard
#c        version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#c     alink import.o -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -csla`
#c        Links an ADAM program ``import'', written in C, which does not
#c        produce any graphical output. The ``-csla'' flag indicates that the C
#c        version of SLALIB should be used by AST (to avoid conflict with the
#c        main program which may already be calling this version).
#c     alink plotit.o -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -mygrf` -lgrf_my
#c        Links an ADAM program ``plotit'', written in C. The ``-mygrf''
#c        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#c        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself. Here, this
#c        interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf_my'' library reference.
#f     alink display.f -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -pgplot`
#f        Compiles and links an ADAM Fortran program called ``display'' which
#f        uses the standard version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#f     alink import.f -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -csla`
#f        Compiles and links an ADAM Fortran program called ``import'' which
#f        does not produce any graphical output. The ``-csla'' flag indicates
#f        that the C version of SLALIB should be used by AST (this should be
#f        avoided if the main program already calls the Fortran version).
#f     alink plotit.f -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -mygrf` -lgrf_my
#f        Compiles and links an ADAM Fortran program ``plotit''. The ``-mygrf''
#f        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#f        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself. Here, this
#f        interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf_my'' library reference.
