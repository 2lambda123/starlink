#  Name:
#     ast_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Link an ADAM program with the AST library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This command should only be used when building Starlink ADAM programs
#     which use the AST library, in order to generate the correct arguments
#     to allow the ADAM ``alink'' command to link the program. The arguments
#     generated are written to standard output but may be substituted into
#     the ``alink'' command line in the standard UNIX way using backward
#     quotes (see below).
#
#     By default, it is assumed that you are building an ADAM program which
#     does not produce graphical output. However, switches are provided for
#     linking other types of program. This command should not be used when
#     building stand-alone (non-ADAM) programs. Use the ``ast_link'' command
#     instead.

#  Invocation:
#c     alink program.o -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam [switches]`
#f     alink program.f -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam [switches]`

#  Switches:
#     The following switches may optionally be given to this command to
#     modify its behaviour:
#
#     - ``-csla'': Requests that the program be linked so that it uses the
#     full C implementation of the SLALIB positional astronomy library 
#     available from tpoint (www.tpsoft.demon.co.uk). See the "SLALIB"
#     section below.
#
#     - ``-fsla'': Requests that the program be linked so that it uses the
#     Starlink Fortran implementation of the SLALIB library (Starlink User 
#     Note SUN/67). See the "SLALIB" section below.
#
#     - ``-grf'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify which
#     graphics system is used to display output from the AST library. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new graphics system yourself and wish to provide your own arguments for
#     linking with it. This switch differs from the other ``grf'' switches in 
#     that it assumes that your graphics module implements the complete 
#     interface required by the current version of AST. If future versions of 
#     AST introduce new functions to the graphics interface, this switch will 
#     cause ``unresolved symbol'' errors to occur during linking, warning you 
#     that you need to implement new functions in your graphics module. To 
#     avoid such errors, you can use one of the other, version-specific, 
#     switches in place of the ``-grf'' switch, but these will cause run-time 
#     errors to be reported if any AST function is invoked which requires 
#     facilities not in the implemented interface.
#
#     - ``-grf_v2.0'': This switch is equivalent to the ``-mygrf'' switch.
#     It indicates that you want to link with your own graphics module which 
#     implements the graphics interface required by V2.0 of AST.
#
#     - ``-grf_v3.2'': Indicates that you want to link with your own graphics 
#     module which implements the graphics interface required by V3.2 of AST.
#
#     - ``-myerr'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify how
#     error messages produced by the AST library should be delivered. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new error delivery system yourself and wish to provide your own
#     arguments for linking with it. By default, error messages are delivered
#     in the standard ADAM way via the EMS Error Message Service (Starlink
#     System Note SSN/4).
#
#     - ``-mygrf'': This switch has been superceeded by the ``-grf'' switch,
#     but is retained in order to allow applications to be linked with a 
#     graphics module which implements the interface used by AST V2.0. It is 
#     equivalent to the ``-grf_v2.0'' switch.
#
#     - ``-pgp'': Requests that the program be linked so that
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     Starlink version of the PGPLOT graphics package (which uses GKS
#     for its output). By default, no graphics package is linked and
#     this will result in an error at run time if AST routines are
#     invoked that attempt to generate graphical output.
#
#     - ``-pgplot'': Requests that the program be linked so that
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     standard (or ``native'') version of the PGPLOT graphics
#     package. By default, no graphics package is linked and this will
#     result in an error at run time if AST routines are invoked that
#     attempt to generate graphical output.

#  SLALIB:
#     AST applications must be linked against the SLALIB library since AST 
#     uses SLALIB for its low-level astrometric conversions. SLALIB is 
#     available in at least three forms, all written by Pat Wallace: 
#
#     - a Fortran 77 implementation is available from the UK Starlink project
#     (www.starlink.ac.uk) and is distributed under GPL; 
#
#     - a proprietary C implementation is available from the author or from 
#     tpoint (www.tpsoft.demon.co.uk);
#
#     - a cut down subset of the C version including only the functions 
#     needed by the AST library is included within the AST distribution and 
#     is built as part of the process of building AST. This version is 
#     distributed under GPL, and is thus compatible with the AST license.
#
#     By default, this script will link applications using the built-in cut
#     down SLALIB subset. This means that SLALIB need not exist anywhere else 
#     on the building system. However, the "-fsla" and "-csla" options can be 
#     used to force linking with one of the other two versions of SLALIB.
#     Note that both the Fortran and full C implementations of SLALIB use the 
#     same name (``libsla.a'') for their library, so you must ensure that the 
#     directories searched to resolve library references will result in the 
#     correct version of this file (Fortran or C) being located (the internal 
#     cut down version of SLALIB uses a different library name). Note, the 
#     Fortran version of SLALIB includes a script called sla_link which should 
#     be available on the current PATH if the Fortran version is to be used. 
#     If this script cannot be found, then no options to link with SLALIB 
#     will be included and consequently errors will probably be reported by 
#     the compiler because of unresolved references to the SLALIB routines 
#     used by AST. If the ``-fsla'' option is not used, then the sla_link 
#     script is not needed.

#  Examples:
#c     alink display.o -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -pgplot`
#c        Links an ADAM program ``display'' which uses the standard
#c        version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#c     alink import.o -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -csla`
#c        Links an ADAM program ``import'', written in C, which does not
#c        produce any graphical output. The ``-csla'' flag indicates that the 
#c        full proprietary C version of SLALIB should be used by AST.
#c     alink plotit.o -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -grf` -lgrf
#c        Links an ADAM program ``plotit'', written in C. The ``-grf''
#c        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#c        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which 
#c        corresponds to the interface required by the current version of AST. 
#c        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library 
#c        reference.
#c     alink plotit.o -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -grf_v2.0` -lgrf
#c        Links an ADAM program ``plotit'', written in C. The ``-grf_v2.0''
#c        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#c        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which 
#c        corresponds to the interface required by version 2.0 of AST. Here, 
#c        this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library 
#c        reference.
#f     alink display.f -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -pgplot`
#f        Compiles and links an ADAM Fortran program called ``display'' which
#f        uses the standard version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#f     alink import.f -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -csla`
#f        Compiles and links an ADAM Fortran program called ``import'' which
#f        does not produce any graphical output. The ``-csla'' flag indicates
#f        that the full proprietary C version of SLALIB should be used by AST 
#f        (this should be avoided if the main program already calls the 
#f        Fortran version).
#f     alink plotit.f -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -grf` -lgrf
#f        Compiles and links an ADAM Fortran program ``plotit''. The ``-grf''
#f        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#f        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which 
#f        corresponds to the interface required by the current version of AST. 
#f        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library 
#f        reference.
#f     alink plotit.f -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -grf_v2.0` -lgrf
#f        Compiles and links an ADAM Fortran program ``plotit''. The ``-grf_v2.0''
#f        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#f        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which 
#f        corresponds to the interface required by version 2.0 of AST. 
#f        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library 
#f        reference.
