*class++
*  Name:
*     NullRegion

*  Purpose:
*     A boundless region within a Frame.

*  Constructor Function:
c     astNullRegion
f     AST_NULLREGION

*  Description:
*     The NullRegion class implements a Region with no bounds within a Frame.
*     If the Negated attribute of a NullRegion is false, the NullRegion
*     represents a Region containing no points. If the Negated attribute of 
*     a NullRegion is true, the NullRegion represents an infinite Region 
*     (that is, all points in the coordinate system are inside the NullRegion).

*  Inheritance:
*     The NullRegion class inherits from the Region class.

*  Attributes:
*     The NullRegion class does not define any new attributes beyond
*     those which are applicable to all Regions.

*  Functions:
c     The NullRegion class does not define any new functions beyond those
f     The NullRegion class does not define any new routines beyond those
*     which are applicable to all Regions.

*  Description:
*     This function returns an integer value indicating if the two
*     supplied Regions overlap. The two Regions are converted to a commnon
*     coordinate system before performing the check. If this conversion is 
*     not possible (for instance because the two Regions represent areas in
*     different domains), then the check cannot be performed and a zero value 
*     is returned to indicate this.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the first Region.
*     that
*        Pointer to the second Region.

*  Returned Value:
*     astOverlap()
*        A value indicating if there is any overlap between the two Regions.
*        Possible values are:
*
*        0 - The check could not be performed because the second Region
*            could not be mapped into the coordinate system of the first 
*            Region.
*
*        1 - There is no overlap between the two Regions.
*
*        2 - The first Region is completely inside the second Region.
*
*        3 - The second Region is completely inside the first Region.
*
*        4 - There is partial overlap between the two Regions.
*
*        5 - The Regions are identical.
*
*        6 - The second Region is the negation of the first Region.

*  Notes:
*     - The returned values 5 and 6 do not check the value of the Closed 
*     attribute in the two Regions. 
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked with the 
*     AST error status set, or if it should fail for any reason.

* Implementation Notes:
*    - This function is simply a wrap-up for the OverlapX function
*    which performs the required processing but swaps the order of the
*    two arguments. This is a trick to allow the astOverlap
*    method to be over-ridden by derived classes on the basis of the
*    class of either of the two arguments.

*  Type:

*     AstPointSet *Transform( AstMapping *this, AstPointSet *in,

*  Class Membership:
*     NullRegion member function (over-rides the astTransform protected
*     method inherited from the Mapping class).

*  Description:
*     This function takes a NullRegion and a set of points encapsulated in a
*     PointSet and transforms the points by setting axis values to
*     AST__BAD for all points which are outside the region. Points inside
*     the region are copied unchanged from input to output.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the NullRegion.
*     in
*        Pointer to the PointSet holding the input coordinate data.
*     forward
*        A non-zero value indicates that the forward coordinate transformation
*        should be applied, while a zero value requests the inverse
*        transformation.
*     out
*        Pointer to a PointSet which will hold the transformed (output)
*        coordinate values. A NULL value may also be given, in which case a
*        new PointSet will be created by this function.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the output (possibly new) PointSet.

*  Notes:
*     -  The forward and inverse transformations are identical for a
*     Region.
*     -  A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked with the
*     global error status set, or if it should fail for any reason.
*     -  The number of coordinate values per point in the input PointSet must
*     match the number of axes in the Frame represented by the NullRegion.
*     -  If an output PointSet is supplied, it must have space for sufficient
*     number of points and coordinate values per point to accommodate the
*     result. Any excess space will be ignored.

c     AstNullRegion *astNullRegion( AstFrame *frame, AstRegion *unc, const char *options, ... )
f     RESULT = AST_NULLREGION( FRAME, UNC, OPTIONS, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     NullRegion constructor.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new NullRegion and optionally initialises its
*     attributes.
*
*     A NullRegion is a Region with no bounds. If the Negated attribute of a 
*     NullRegion is false, the NullRegion represents a Region containing no 
*     points. If the Negated attribute of a NullRegion is true, the NullRegion 
*     represents an infinite Region containing all points within the
*     coordinate system.

*  Parameters:
c     frame
f     FRAME = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to the Frame in which the region is defined. A deep
*        copy is taken of the supplied Frame. This means that any
*        subsequent changes made to the Frame using the supplied pointer
*        will have no effect the Region.
c     unc
f     UNC = INTEGER (Given)
*        An optional pointer to an existing Region which specifies the 
*        uncertainties associated with positions in the supplied Frame. 
*        The uncertainty in any point in the Frame is found by shifting the 
*        supplied "uncertainty" Region so that it is centred at the point 
*        being considered. The area covered by the shifted uncertainty 
*        Region then represents the uncertainty in the position. The 
*        uncertainty is assumed to be the same for all points.
*
*        If supplied, the uncertainty Region must be of a class for which 
*        all instances are centro-symetric (e.g. Box, Circle, Ellipse, etc.) 
*        or be a Prism containing centro-symetric component Regions. A deep 
*        copy of the supplied Region will be taken, so subsequent changes to 
*        the uncertainty Region using the supplied pointer will have no 
*        effect on the created Box. Alternatively, 
f        a null Object pointer (AST__NULL) 
c        a NULL Object pointer 
*        may be supplied, in which case a default uncertainty of zero is 
*        used.
c     options
f     OPTIONS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing an optional
c        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
c        initialising the new NullRegion. The syntax used is identical to
c        that for the astSet function and may include "printf" format
c        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.
f        A character string containing an optional comma-separated
f        list of attribute assignments to be used for initialising the
f        new NullRegion. The syntax used is identical to that for the
f        AST_SET routine.
c     ...
c        If the "options" string contains "%" format specifiers, then
c        an optional list of additional arguments may follow it in
c        order to supply values to be substituted for these
c        specifiers. The rules for supplying these are identical to
c        those for the astSet function (and for the C "printf"
c        function).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astNullRegion()
f     AST_NULLREGION = INTEGER
*        A pointer to the new NullRegion.

*  Notes:
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This function is provided for use by class implementations to initialise
*     a new NullRegion object. It allocates memory (if necessary) to accommodate
*     the NullRegion plus any additional data associated with the derived class.
*     It then initialises a NullRegion structure at the start of this memory. If
*     the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a virtual
*     function table for a NullRegion at the start of the memory passed via the
*     "vtab" parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory in which the NullRegion is to be initialised.
*        This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the NullRegion data
*        (sizeof(NullRegion)) plus any data used by the derived class. If a value
*        of NULL is given, this function will allocate the memory itself using
*        the "size" parameter to determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the NullRegion (plus derived class data).
*        This will be used to allocate memory if a value of NULL is given for
*        the "mem" parameter. This value is also stored in the NullRegion
*        structure, so a valid value must be supplied even if not required for
*        allocating memory.
*     init
*        A logical flag indicating if the NullRegion's virtual function table is
*        to be initialised. If this value is non-zero, the virtual function
*        table will be initialised by this function.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be associated
*        with the new NullRegion.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which contains
*        the name of the class to which the new object belongs (it is this
*        pointer value that will subsequently be returned by the astGetClass
*        method).
*     frame
*        A pointer to the Frame in which the region is defined.
*     unc
*        A pointer to a Region which specifies the uncertainty of positions 
*        within the supplied Frame. A NULL pointer can be supplied, in which 
*        case default uncertainties of zero are used. If an uncertainty 
*        Region is supplied, it must be either a Box, a Circle or an Ellipse,
*        and its encapsulated Frame must be related to the Frame supplied
*        for parameter "frame" (i.e. astConvert should be able to find a 
*        Mapping between them). The centre of the supplied uncertainty 
*        Region is immaterial since it will be re-centred on the point 
*        being tested before use. A deep copy is taken of the supplied 
*        Region.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new NullRegion.

*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the NullRegion (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of

*        stored in the NullRegion structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*

/* ============================ */
/* These provide the external interface to the virtual functions defined by
   this class. Each simply checks the global error status and then locates and
   executes the appropriate member function, using the function pointer stored
   in the object's virtual function table (this pointer is located using the
   astMEMBER macro defined in "object.h").

   Note that the member function may not be the one defined here, as it may
   have been over-ridden by a derived class. However, it should still have the
   same interface. */
