#  Name:
#     ast_link

#  Purpose:
#     Link a program with the AST library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This command should be used when building programs which use the AST
#     library, in order to generate the correct arguments to allow the compiler
#     to link your program. The arguments generated are written to standard
#     output but may be substituted into the compiler command line in the
#     standard UNIX way using backward quotes (see below).
#
#     By default, it is assumed that you are building a stand-alone program
#     which does not produce graphical output. However, switches are provided
#     for linking other types of program.

#  Invocation:
#c     cc program.c -L/star/lib `ast_link [switches]` -o program
#f     f77 program.f -L/star/lib `ast_link [switches]` -o program

#  Switches:
#     The following switches may optionally be given to this command to
#     modify its behaviour:
#
#     - ``-csla'': Requests that the program be linked so that it uses the
#     C implementation of the SLALIB positional astronomy library. By default,
#     the Fortran implementation is used (Starlink User Note SUN/67). Note
#     that both implementations of SLALIB use the same name (``libsla.a'') for
#     their library, so you must ensure that the directories searched to
#     resolve library references will result in the correct version of this
#     file (Fortran or C) being located.
#
#     - ``-ems'': Requests that the program be linked so that error messages
#     produced by the AST library are delivered via the Starlink EMS (Error
#     Message Service) library (Starlink System Note SSN/4). By default,
#     error messages are simply written to standard error.
#
#     - ``-myerr'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify how
#     error messages produced by the AST library should be delivered. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new error delivery system yourself and wish to provide your own
#     arguments for linking with it.
#
#     - ``-mygrf'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify which
#     graphics system is used to display output from the AST library. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new graphics system yourself and wish to provide your own arguments for
#     linking with it.
#
#     - ``-pgp'': Requests that the program be linked so that
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     Starlink version of the PGPLOT graphics package (which uses GKS
#     for its output). By default, no graphics package is linked and
#     this will result in an error at run time if AST routines are
#     invoked that attempt to generate graphical output.
#
#     - ``-pgplot'': Requests that the program be linked so that
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     standard (or ``native'') version of the PGPLOT graphics
#     package. By default, no graphics package is linked and this will
#     result in an error at run time if AST routines are invoked that
#     attempt to generate graphical output.

#  Examples:
#c     cc display.c -L/star/lib `ast_link -pgplot` -o display
#c        Compiles and links a C program called ``display'' which uses
#c        the standard version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#c     cc import.c -L/star/lib `ast_link -csla` -o import
#c        Compiles and links a C program called ``import'' which does
#c        not produce any graphical output. The ``-csla'' flag indicates that
#c        the C version of SLALIB should be used by AST (to avoid conflict
#c        with the main program which may already be calling this version).
#c     cc plotit.c -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link -mygrf` -lgrf_my -o plotit
#c        Compiles and links a C program ``plotit''. The ``-mygrf''
#c        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#c        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself. Here, this
#c        interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf_my'' library reference.
#f     f77 display.f -L/star/lib `ast_link -pgplot` -o display
#f        Compiles and links a Fortran program called ``display'' which uses
#f        the standard version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#f     f77 import.f -L/star/lib `ast_link -csla` -o import
#f        Compiles and links a Fortran program called ``import'' which does
#f        not produce any graphical output. The ``-csla'' flag indicates that
#f        the C version of SLALIB should be used by AST (this should be avoided
#f        if the main program already calls the Fortran version).
#f     f77 plotit.f -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link -mygrf` -lgrf_my -o plotit
#f        Compiles and links a Fortran program ``plotit''. The ``-mygrf''
#f        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#f        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself. Here, this
#f        interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf_my'' library reference.

#     18-NOV-1997 (RFWS):
#        Adapted prologue for document extraction.
#     28-SEP-1998 (RFWS):
#        Distinguish between -pgp and -pgplot options.
#     12-JAN-2001 (DSB):
#        Move terminating "}" in function "find" onto a new line to
#        avoid error when run under bash 2.04.11(1) (redhat 7).
#     3-MAY-2001 (DSB):
#        Added a terminating ";" to the "done" statement at the end of 
#        the "find" function, so that ast_link can be used on Debian Linux.
