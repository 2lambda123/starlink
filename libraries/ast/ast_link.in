#  Name:
#     ast_link

#  Purpose:
#     Link a program with the AST library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This command should be used when building programs which use the AST
#     library, in order to generate the correct arguments to allow the compiler
#     to link your program. The arguments generated are written to standard
#     output but may be substituted into the compiler command line in the
#     standard UNIX way using backward quotes (see below).
#
#     By default, it is assumed that you are building a stand-alone program
#     which does not produce graphical output. However, switches are provided
#     for linking other types of program.

#  Invocation:
#c     cc program.c -L/star/lib `ast_link [switches]` -o program
#f     f77 program.f -L/star/lib `ast_link [switches]` -o program

#  Switches:
#     The following switches may optionally be given to this command to
#     modify its behaviour:
#
#     - ``-csla'': Requests that the program be linked so that it uses the
#     C implementation of the SLALIB positional astronomy library. By default,
#     the Fortran implementation is used (Starlink User Note SUN/67). Note
#     that both implementations of SLALIB use the same name (``libsla.a'') for
#     their library, so you must ensure that the directories searched to
#     resolve library references will result in the correct version of this
#     file (Fortran or C) being located.
#
#     - ``-ems'': Requests that the program be linked so that error messages
#     produced by the AST library are delivered via the Starlink EMS (Error
#     Message Service) library (Starlink System Note SSN/4). By default,
#     error messages are simply written to standard error.
#
#     - ``-grf'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify which
#     graphics system is used to display output from the AST library. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new graphics system yourself and wish to provide your own arguments for
#     linking with it. This switch differs from the other ``grf'' switches in 
#     that it assumes that your graphics module implements the complete 
#     interface required by the current version of AST. If future versions of 
#     AST introduce new functions to the graphics interface, this switch will 
#     cause ``unresolved symbol'' errors to occur during linking, warning you 
#     that you need to implement new functions in your graphics module. To 
#     avoid such errors, you can use one of the other, version-specific, 
#     switches in place of the ``-grf'' switch, but these will cause run-time 
#     errors to be reported if any AST function is invoked which requires 
#     facilities not in the implemented interface.
#
#     - ``-grf_v2.0'': This switch is equivalent to the ``-mygrf'' switch.
#     It indicates that you want to link with your own graphics module which 
#     implements the graphics interface required by V2.0 of AST.
#
#     - ``-grf_v3.2'': Indicates that you want to link with your own graphics 
#     module which implements the graphics interface required by V3.2 of AST.
#
#     - ``-myerr'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify how
#     error messages produced by the AST library should be delivered. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new error delivery system yourself and wish to provide your own
#     arguments for linking with it.
#
#     - ``-mygrf'': This switch has been superceeded by the ``-grf'' switch,
#     but is retained in order to allow applications to be linked with a 
#     graphics module which implements the interface used by AST V2.0. It is 
#     equivalent to the ``-grf_v2.0'' switch.
#
#     - ``-pgp'': Requests that the program be linked so that
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     Starlink version of the PGPLOT graphics package (which uses GKS
#     for its output). By default, no graphics package is linked and
#     this will result in an error at run time if AST routines are
#     invoked that attempt to generate graphical output.
#
#     - ``-pgplot'': Requests that the program be linked so that
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     standard (or ``native'') version of the PGPLOT graphics
#     package. By default, no graphics package is linked and this will
#     result in an error at run time if AST routines are invoked that
#     attempt to generate graphical output.

#  Examples:
#c     cc display.c -L/star/lib `ast_link -pgplot` -o display
#c        Compiles and links a C program called ``display'' which uses
#c        the standard version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#c     cc import.c -L/star/lib `ast_link -csla` -o import
#c        Compiles and links a C program called ``import'' which does
#c        not produce any graphical output. The ``-csla'' flag indicates that
#c        the C version of SLALIB should be used by AST (to avoid conflict
#c        with the main program which may already be calling this version).
#c     cc plotit.c -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link -grf` -lgrf -o plotit
#c        Compiles and links a C program ``plotit''. The ``-grf''
#c        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#c        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which 
#c        corresponds to the interface required by the current version of AST. 
#c        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library 
#c        reference.
#c     cc plotit.c -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link -grf_v2.0` -lgrf -o plotit
#c        Compiles and links a C program ``plotit''. The ``-grf_v2.0''
#c        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#c        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which 
#c        corresponds to the interface required by version 2.0 of AST. 
#c        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library 
#c        reference.
#f     f77 display.f -L/star/lib `ast_link -pgplot` -o display
#f        Compiles and links a Fortran program called ``display'' which uses
#f        the standard version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#f     f77 import.f -L/star/lib `ast_link -csla` -o import
#f        Compiles and links a Fortran program called ``import'' which does
#f        not produce any graphical output. The ``-csla'' flag indicates that
#f        the C version of SLALIB should be used by AST (this should be avoided
#f        if the main program already calls the Fortran version).
#f     f77 plotit.f -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link -grf` -lgrf -o plotit
#f        Compiles and links a Fortran program ``plotit''. The ``-grf''
#f        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#f        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which 
#f        corresponds to the interface required by the current version of AST. 
#f        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library 
#f        reference.
#f     f77 plotit.f -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link -grf_v2.0` -lgrf -o plotit
#f        Compiles and links a Fortran program ``plotit''. The ``-grf_v2.0''
#f        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#f        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which 
#f        corresponds to the interface required by version 2.0 of AST. 
#f        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library 
#f        reference.
