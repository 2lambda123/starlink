*class++
*  Name:
*     Frame

*  Purpose:
*     Coordinate system description.

*  Constructor Function:
c     astFrame
f     AST_FRAME

*  Description:
*     This class is used to represent coordinate systems. It does this
*     in rather the same way that a frame around a graph describes the
*     coordinate space in which data are plotted. Consequently, a
*     Frame has a Title (string) attribute, which describes the
*     coordinate space, and contains axes which in turn hold
*     information such as Label and Units strings which are used for
*     labelling (e.g.) graphical output. In general, however, the
*     number of axes is not restricted to two.
*
*     Functions are available for converting Frame coordinate values
*     into a form suitable for display, and also for calculating
*     distances and offsets between positions within the Frame.
*
*     Frames may also contain knowledge of how to transform to and
*     from related coordinate systems.

*  Inheritance:
*     The Frame class inherits from the Mapping class.

*  Attributes:
*     In addition to those attributes common to all Mappings, every
*     Frame also has the following attributes (if the Frame has only one
*     axis, the axis specifier can be omited from the following attribute 
*     names):
*
*     - AlignSystem: Coordinate system used to align Frames
*     - Bottom(axis): Lowest axis value to display
*     - Digits/Digits(axis): Number of digits of precision
*     - Direction(axis): Display axis in conventional direction?
*     - Domain: Coordinate system domain
*     - Epoch: Epoch of observation
*     - Format(axis): Format specification for axis values
*     - Label(axis): Axis label
*     - MatchEnd: Match trailing axes?
*     - MaxAxes: Maximum number of Frame axes to match
*     - MinAxes: Minimum number of Frame axes to match
*     - Naxes: Number of Frame axes
*     - Permute: Permute axis order?
*     - PreserveAxes: Preserve axes?
*     - Symbol(axis): Axis symbol
*     - System: Coordinate system used to describe the domain
*     - Title: Frame title
*     - Top(axis): Highest axis value to display
*     - Unit(axis): Axis physical units

*  Functions:
c     In addition to those functions applicable to all Mappings, the
c     following functions may also be applied to all Frames:
f     In addition to those routines applicable to all Mappings, the
f     following routines may also be applied to all Frames:
*

c     - astAxOffset: Calculate an offset along an axis
c     - astConvert: Determine how to convert between two coordinate systems
c     - astDistance: Calculate the distance between two points in a Frame
c     - astFindFrame: Find a coordinate system with specified characteristics
c     - astFormat: Format a coordinate value for a Frame axis
c     - astGetActiveUnit: Determines how the Unit attribute will be used
c     - astNorm: Normalise a set of Frame coordinates
c     - astOffset: Calculate an offset along a geodesic curve
c     - astOffset2: Calculate an offset along a geodesic curve in a 2D Frame
c     - astPermAxes: Permute the order of a Frame's axes
c     - astPickAxes: Create a new Frame by picking axes from an existing one
c     - astResolve: Resolve a vector into two orthogonal components
c     - astSetActiveUnit: Specify how the Unit attribute should be used
c     - astUnformat: Read a formatted coordinate value for a Frame axis
f     - AST_ANGLE: Find the angle subtended by two points at a third point
f     - AST_AXANGLE: Find the angle from an axis, to a line through two points

f     - AST_CONVERT: Determine how to convert between two coordinate systems
f     - AST_DISTANCE: Calculate the distance between two points in a Frame
f     - AST_FINDFRAME: Find a coordinate system with specified characteristics
f     - AST_FORMAT: Format a coordinate value for a Frame axis
f     - AST_GETACTIVEUNIT: Determines how the Unit attribute will be used

f     - AST_SETACTIVEUNIT: Specify how the Unit attribute should be used
f     - AST_UNFORMAT: Read a formatted coordinate value for a Frame axis

*  Notes:
*     - When used as a Mapping, a Frame implements a unit (null)
*     transformation in both the forward and inverse directions
*     (equivalent to a UnitMap). The Nin and Nout attribute values are
*     both equal to the number of Frame axes.

*+
*  Name:
*     astAbbrev

*  Purpose:
*     Abbreviate a formatted Frame axis value by skipping leading fields.

*  Type:
*     Protected virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "frame.h"
*     const char *astAbbrev( AstFrame *this, int axis, const char *fmt, 
*                            const char *str1, const char *str2 )

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame method.

*  Description:
*     This function compares two Frame axis values that have been
*     formatted (using astFormat) and determines if they have any
*     redundant leading fields (i.e. leading fields in common which
*     can be suppressed when tabulating the values or plotting them on
*     the axis of a graph).

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     axis
*        The number of the Frame axis for which the values have been
*        formatted (axis numbering starts at zero for the first axis).
*     fmt
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        format specification used to format the two values.
*     str1
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        first formatted value.
*     str1
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        second formatted value.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer into the "str2" string which locates the first
*     character in the first field that differs between the two
*     formatted values.
*
*     If the two values have no leading fields in common, the returned
*     value will point at the start of string "str2". If the two
*     values are equal, it will point at the terminating null at the
*     end of this string.

*  Notes:
*     - This function assumes that the format specification used was
*     the same when both values were formatted and that they both
*     apply to the same Frame axis.
*     - A pointer to the start of "str2" will be returned if this
*     function is invoked with the global error status set, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.

*  Description:
c     This function returns an axis value formed by adding a signed axis
f     This routine returns an axis value formed by adding a signed axis
*     increment onto a supplied axis value.
*
*     For a simple Frame, this is a trivial operation returning the

*     of Frame (such as a SkyFrame) this is not the case.

*  Parameters:

f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Frame.
c     axis
f     AXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the axis to which the supplied values refer. The
*        first axis has index 1.
c     v1
f     V1 = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The original axis value.
c     dist
f     DIST = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The axis increment to add to the original axis value.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astAxOffset
f     AST_AXOFFSET = DOUBLE PRECISION
*        The incremented axis value.

*  Notes:
*     - This function will return a "bad" result value (AST__BAD) if

*     void astCheckPerm( AstFrame *this, const int *perm, const char *method )

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame method.

*  Description:
*     This function checks the validity of a permutation array that
*     will be used to permute the order of a Frame's axes. If the
*     permutation specified by the array is not valid, an error is
*     reported and the global error status is set. Otherwise, the
*     function returns without further action.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     perm
*        Pointer to an array of integers with the same number of
*        elements as there are axes in the Frame. For each axis, the
*        corresponding integer gives the (zero based) axis index to be
*        used to identify the information for that axis (using the
*        un-permuted axis numbering). To be valid, the integers in
*        this array should therefore all lie in the range zero to
*        (naxes-1) inclusive, where "naxes" is the number of Frame
*        axes, and each value should occur exactly once.
*     method
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string
*        containing the name of the method that invoked this function
*        to validate a permutation array. This method name is used
*        solely for constructing error messages.

*  Notes:
*     - Error messages issued by this function refer to the external
*     (public) numbering system used for axes (which is one-based),
*     whereas zero-based axis indices are used internally.

*  Purpose:

*  Type:
*     Public virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "frame.h"
c     AstFrameSet *astConvert( AstFrame *from, AstFrame *to,
c                              const char *domainlist )
f     RESULT = AST_CONVERT( FROM, TO, DOMAINLIST, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame method.

*  Description:
*     This function compares two Frames and determines whether it is
*     possible to convert between the coordinate systems which they
*     represent. If conversion is possible, it returns a FrameSet
*     which describes the conversion and which may be used (as a
*     Mapping) to transform coordinate values in either direction.
*
*     The same function may also be used to determine how to convert
*     between two FrameSets (or between a Frame and a FrameSet, or
*     vice versa). This mode is intended for use when (for example)
*     two images have been calibrated by attaching a FrameSet to each.
c     astConvert might then be used to search for a
f     AST_CONVERT might then be used to search for a
*     celestial coordinate system that both images have in common, and
*     the result could then be used to convert between the pixel
*     coordinates of both images -- having effectively used their
*     celestial coordinate systems to align them.
*
*     When using FrameSets, there may be more than one possible
*     intermediate coordinate system in which to perform the
*     conversion (for instance, two FrameSets might both have
*     celestial coordinates, detector coordinates, pixel coordinates,
*     etc.). A comma-separated list of coordinate system domains may
*     therefore be given which defines a priority order to use when
*     selecting the intermediate coordinate system.  The path used for
*     conversion must go via an intermediate coordinate system whose
*     Domain attribute matches one of the domains given. If conversion
*     cannot be achieved using the first domain, the next one is
*     considered, and so on, until success is achieved.

*  Parameters:
c     from
f     FROM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a Frame which represents the "source" coordinate
*        system.  This is the coordinate system in which you already
*        have coordinates available.
*
*        If a FrameSet is given, its current Frame (as determined by
*        its Current attribute) is taken to describe the source
*        coordinate system. Note that the Base attribute of this
*        FrameSet may be modified by this function to indicate which
*        intermediate coordinate system was used (see under
*        "FrameSets" in the "Class Applicability" section for
*        details).
c     to
f     TO = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a Frame which represents the "destination"
*        coordinate system. This is the coordinate system into which
*        you wish to convert your coordinates.
*
*        If a FrameSet is given, its current Frame (as determined by
*        its Current attribute) is taken to describe the destination
*        coordinate system. Note that the Base attribute of this
*        FrameSet may be modified by this function to indicate which
*        intermediate coordinate system was used (see under
*        "FrameSets" in the "Class Applicability" section for
*        details).
c     domainlist
f     DOMAINLIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated character string containing a
f        A character string containing a
*        comma-separated list of Frame domains. This may be used to
*        define a priority order for the different intermediate
*        coordinate systems that might be used to perform the
*        conversion.
*
*        The function will first try to obtain a conversion by making
*        use only of an intermediate coordinate system whose Domain
*        attribute matches the first domain in this list. If this
*        fails, the second domain in the list will be used, and so on,
*        until conversion is achieved. A blank domain (e.g. two
*        consecutive commas) indicates that all coordinate systems
*        should be considered, regardless of their domains.
*
*        This list is case-insensitive and all white space is ignored.
*        If you do not wish to restrict the domain in this way,
c        you should supply an empty string. This is normally
f        you should supply a blank string. This is normally
*        appropriate if either of the source or destination coordinate
*        systems are described by Frames (rather than FrameSets),
*        since there is then usually only one possible choice of
*        intermediate coordinate system.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astConvert()
f     AST_CONVERT = INTEGER
*        If the requested coordinate conversion is possible, the
*        function returns a pointer to a FrameSet which describes the
*        conversion. Otherwise, a null Object pointer (AST__NULL) is
*        returned without error.
*
*        If a FrameSet is returned, it will contain two Frames. Frame
*        number 1 (its base Frame) will describe the source coordinate
c        system, corresponding to the "from" parameter. Frame number 2
f        system, corresponding to the FROM argument. Frame number 2
*        (its current Frame) will describe the destination coordinate
c        system, corresponding to the "to" parameter. The Mapping
f        system, corresponding to the TO argument. The Mapping
*        which inter-relates these two Frames will perform the
*        required conversion between their respective coordinate
*        systems.
*
*        Note that a FrameSet may be used both as a Mapping and as a
*        Frame.  If the result is used as a Mapping (e.g. with
c        astTran2), then it provides a means of converting coordinates
f        AST_TRAN2), then it provides a means of converting coordinates
*        from the source to the destination coordinate system (or
*        vice versa if its inverse transformation is selected). If it
*        is used as a Frame, its attributes will describe the
*        destination coordinate system.

*  Applicability:
*     DSBSpecFrame
*        Alignment occurs in the upper sideband expressed within the
*        spectral system and standard of rest given by attributes AlignSystem 
*        and AlignStdOfRest.
*     Frame
*        This function applies to all Frames. Alignment occurs within the
*        coordinate system given by attribute AlignSystem.
*     FrameSet
c        If either of the "from" or "to" parameters is a pointer to a
f        If either of the FROM or TO arguments is a pointer to a
c        FrameSet, then astConvert will attempt to convert from the
f        FrameSet, then AST_CONVERT will attempt to convert from the
c        coordinate system described by the current Frame of the "from"
f        coordinate system described by the current Frame of the FROM
c        FrameSet to that described by the current Frame of the "to"
f        FrameSet to that described by the current Frame of the TO
*        FrameSet.
*
*        To achieve this, it will consider all of the Frames within
*        each FrameSet as a possible way of reaching an intermediate
*        coordinate system that can be used for the conversion. There
*        is then the possibility that more than one conversion path
*        may exist and, unless the choice is sufficiently restricted
c        by the "domainlist" string, the sequence in which the Frames
f        by the DOMAINLIST string, the sequence in which the Frames
*        are considered can be important. In this case, the search
*        for a conversion path proceeds as follows:
c        - Each field in the "domainlist" string is considered in turn.
f        - Each field in the DOMAINLIST string is considered in turn.
*        - The Frames within each FrameSet are considered in a
*        specific order: (1) the base Frame is always considered
*        first, (2) after this come all the other Frames in
*        Frame-index order (but omitting the base and current Frames),
*        (3) the current Frame is always considered last.  However, if
*        either FrameSet's Invert attribute is set to a non-zero value
*        (so that the FrameSet is inverted), then its Frames are
*        considered in reverse order. (Note that this still means that
*        the base Frame is considered first and the current Frame
*        last, because the Invert value will also cause these Frames
*        to swap places.)
*        - All source Frames are first considered (in the appropriate
*        order) for conversion to the first destination Frame. If no
*        suitable intermediate coordinate system emerges, they are
*        then considered again for conversion to the second
*        destination Frame (in the appropriate order), and so on.
*        - Generally, the first suitable intermediate coordinate
*        system found is used. However, the overall Mapping between
*        the source and destination coordinate systems is also
*        examined.  Preference is given to cases where both the
*        forward and inverse transformations are defined (as indicated
*        by the TranForward and TranInverse attributes). If only one
*        transformation is defined, the forward one is preferred.
*        - If the domain of the intermediate coordinate system matches
c        the current "domainlist" field, the conversion path is
f        the current DOMAINLIST field, the conversion path is
c        accepted. Otherwise, the next "domainlist" field is considered
f        accepted. Otherwise, the next DOMAINLIST field is considered
*        and the process repeated.
*
*        If conversion is possible, the Base attributes of the two
*        FrameSets will be modified on exit to identify the Frames
*        used to access the intermediate coordinate system which was
*        finally accepted.
*
*        Note that it is possible to force a particular Frame within a
*        FrameSet to be used as the basis for the intermediate
*        coordinate system, if it is suitable, by (a) focussing
*        attention on
c        it by specifying its domain in the "domainlist" string, or (b)
f        it by specifying its domain in the DOMAINLIST string, or (b)
*        making it the base Frame, since this is always considered
*        first.
*     SpecFrame
*        Alignment occurs within the spectral system and standard of rest 
*        given by attributes AlignSystem and AlignStdOfRest.

*  Examples:
c     cvt = astConvert( a, b, "" );
f     CVT = AST_CONVERT( A, B, ' ', STATUS )
*        Attempts to convert between the coordinate systems represented
c        by "a" and "b" (assumed to be Frames). If successful, a FrameSet
f        by A and B (assumed to be Frames). If successful, a FrameSet
c        is returned via the "cvt" pointer which may be used to apply the
f        is returned via the CVT pointer which may be used to apply the
c        conversion to sets of coordinates (e.g. using astTran2).
f        conversion to sets of coordinates (e.g. using AST_TRAN2).
c     cvt = astConvert( astSkyFrame(""), astSkyFrame("Equinox=2005"), "" );
f     CVT = AST_CONVERT( AST_SKYFRAME( ' ', STATUS ), AST_SKYFRAME( 'Equinox=2005', STATUS ), ' ', STATUS )
*        Creates a FrameSet which describes precession in the default
*        FK5 celestial coordinate system between equinoxes J2000 (also
c        the default) and J2005. The returned "cvt" pointer may then
f        the default) and J2005. The returned CVT pointer may then
c        be passed to astTran2 to apply this precession correction to
f        be passed to AST_TRAN2 to apply this precession correction to
*        any number of coordinate values given in radians.
*
*        Note that the returned FrameSet also contains information
*        about how to format coordinate values. This means that
*        setting its Report attribute to 1 is a simple way to obtain
*        printed output (formatted in sexagesimal notation) to show
*        the coordinate values before and after conversion.
c     cvt = astConvert( a, b, "sky,detector," );
f     CVT = AST_CONVERT( A, B, 'SKY,DETECTOR,', STATUS )
*        Attempts to convert between the coordinate systems
c        represented by the current Frames of "a" and "b"
f        represented by the current Frames of A and B
*        (now assumed to be FrameSets), via the intermediate "SKY"
*        coordinate system.  This, by default, is the Domain
*        associated with a celestial coordinate system represented by
*        a SkyFrame.
*
*        If this fails (for example, because either FrameSet lacks
*        celestial coordinate information), then the user-defined
*        "DETECTOR" coordinate system is used instead. If this also
*        fails, then all other possible ways of achieving conversion
*        are considered before giving up.
*
c        The returned pointer "cvt" indicates whether conversion was
f        The returned pointer CVT indicates whether conversion was
*        possible and will have the value AST__NULL if it was not. If
c        conversion was possible, "cvt" will point at a new FrameSet
f        conversion was possible, CVT will point at a new FrameSet
*        describing the conversion.
*
*        The Base attributes of the two FrameSets
c        will be set by astConvert to indicate which of their Frames was
f        will be set by AST_CONVERT to indicate which of their Frames was
*        used for the intermediate coordinate system. This means that
*        you can subsequently determine which coordinate system was
*        used by enquiring the Domain attribute of either base Frame.

*  Notes:
*     -  The Mapping represented by the returned FrameSet results in
*     alignment taking place in the coordinate system specified by the
c     AlignSystem attribute of the "to" Frame. See the description of the
f     AlignSystem attribute of the TO Frame. See the description of the
*     AlignSystem attribute for further details.
*     - When aligning (say) two images, which have been calibrated by
*     attaching FrameSets to them, it is usually necessary to convert
*     between the base Frames (representing "native" pixel
*     coordinates) of both FrameSets. This may be achieved by
*     inverting the FrameSets (e.g. using astInvert) so as to
*     interchange their base and current Frames before using
*     astConvert.
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     - This function's job is basically to negotiate with two Frames
*     to try and find a mutually agreeable coordinate system for
*     conversion.  Ideally, it should be able to juggle the number of
*     axes, etc. to do this.  At present, however, the implementation
*     is much simpler. This is adequate for the Frame classes which
*     exist at the time of writing, but the implementation may need
*     beefing up in future.
*     - One likely problem is with attributes which default in both
*     the source and destination Frames. This means they also default
*     in the common coordinate system. If these default values were to
*     differ when matching different target Frames, however, we would
*     be in trouble, because the common coordinate system would not
*     then be remaining constant. The longer-term solution to this is
*     probably to provide some mechanism to "fix" all attribute values
*     for a Frame, by taking any attributes that are un-set and
*     explicitly setting a firm value (equal to the default) so they
*     cannot then change.

f     RESULT = AST_FINDFRAME( TARGET, TEMPLATE, DOMAINLIST, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame method.

*  Description:
*     This function uses a "template" Frame to search another Frame
*     (or FrameSet) to identify a coordinate system which has a
*     specified set of characteristics. If a suitable coordinate
*     system can be found, the function returns a pointer to a
*     FrameSet which describes the required coordinate system and how
*     to convert coordinates to and from it.
*
*     This function is provided to help answer general questions about
*     coordinate systems, such as typically arise when coordinate
*     information is imported into a program as part of an initially
*     unknown dataset. For example:
*     - Is there a wavelength scale?
*     - Is there a 2-dimensional coordinate system?
*     - Is there a celestial coordinate system?
*     - Can I plot the data in ecliptic coordinates?
*
*     You can also use this function as a means of reconciling a
*     user's preference for a particular coordinate system (for
*     example, what type of axes to draw) with what is actually
*     possible given the coordinate information available.
*
*     To perform a search, you supply a "target" Frame (or FrameSet)
*     which represents the set of coordinate systems to be searched.
*     If a basic Frame is given as the target, this set of coordinate
*     systems consists of the one described by this Frame, plus all
*     other "virtual" coordinate systems which can potentially be
*     reached from it by applying built-in conversions (for example,
*     any of the celestial coordinate conversions known to the AST
*     library would constitute a "built-in" conversion). If a FrameSet
*     is given as the target, the set of coordinate systems to be
*     searched consists of the union of those represented by all the
*     individual Frames within it.
*
*     To select from this large set of possible coordinate systems,
*     you supply a "template" Frame which is an instance of the type
*     of Frame you are looking for. Effectively, you then ask the
*     function to "find a coordinate system that looks like this".
*
*     You can make your request more or less specific by setting
*     attribute values for the template Frame. If a particular
*     attribute is set in the template, then the function will only
*     find coordinate systems which have exactly the same value for
*     that attribute.  If you leave a template attribute un-set,
*     however, then the function has discretion about the value the
*     attribute should have in any coordinate system it finds. The
*     attribute will then take its value from one of the actual
*     (rather than virtual) coordinate systems in the target. If the
*     target is a FrameSet, its Current attribute will be modified to
*     indicate which of its Frames was used for this purpose.
*
*     The result of this process is a coordinate system represented by
*     a hybrid Frame which acquires some attributes from the template
*     (but only if they were set) and the remainder from the
*     target. This represents the "best compromise" between what you
*     asked for and what was available. A Mapping is then generated
*     which converts from the target coordinate system to this hybrid
*     one, and the returned FrameSet encapsulates all of this
*     information.

*  Parameters:
c     target
f     TARGET = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the target Frame (or FrameSet).

*        Note that if a FrameSet is supplied (and a suitable
*        coordinate system is found), then its Current attribute will
*        be modified to indicate which Frame was used to obtain
*        attribute values which were not specified by the template.
*        This Frame will, in some sense, represent the "closest"
*        non-virtual coordinate system to the one you requested.
c     template
f     TEMPLATE = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the template Frame, which should be an instance of
*        the type of Frame you wish to find. If you wanted to find a
*        Frame describing a celestial coordinate system, for example,
*        then you might use a SkyFrame here. See the "Examples"
*        section for more ideas.
c     domainlist
f     DOMAINLIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated character string containing a
f        A character string containing a
*        comma-separated list of Frame domains. This may be used to
*        establish a priority order for the different types of
*        coordinate system that might be found.
*
*        The function will first try to find a suitable coordinate
*        system whose Domain attribute equals the first domain in this
*        list. If this fails, the second domain in the list will be
*        used, and so on, until a result is obtained. A blank domain
*        (e.g. two consecutive commas) indicates that any coordinate
*        system is acceptable (subject to the template) regardless of
*        its domain.
*
*        This list is case-insensitive and all white space is ignored.
*        If you do not wish to restrict the domain in this way,
c        you should supply an empty string.
f        you should supply a blank string.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astFindFrame()
f     AST_FINDFRAME = INTEGER
*        If the search is successful, the function returns a pointer
*        to a FrameSet which contains the Frame found and a
*        description of how to convert to (and from) the coordinate
*        system it represents. Otherwise, a null Object pointer
*        (AST__NULL) is returned without error.
*
*        If a FrameSet is returned, it will contain two Frames. Frame
*        number 1 (its base Frame) represents the target coordinate
*        system and will be the same as the (base Frame of the)
*        target. Frame number 2 (its current Frame) will be a Frame
*        representing the coordinate system which the function
*        found. The Mapping which inter-relates these two Frames will
*        describe how to convert between their respective coordinate
*        systems.
*
*        Note that a FrameSet may be used both as a Mapping and as a
*        Frame. If the result is used as a Mapping (e.g. with
*        astTran2), then it provides a means of converting coordinates
*        from the target coordinate system into the new coordinate
*        system that was found (and vice versa if its inverse
*        transformation is selected). If it is used as a Frame, its
*        attributes will describe the new coordinate system.

*  Applicability:
*     Frame
*        This function applies to all Frames.
*     FrameSet
*        If the target is a FrameSet, the possibility exists that
*        several of the Frames within it might be matched by the
*        template.  Unless the choice is sufficiently restricted by
c        the "domainlist" string, the sequence in which Frames are
f        the DOMAINLIST string, the sequence in which Frames are
*        searched can then become important. In this case, the search
*        proceeds as follows:
c        - Each field in the "domainlist" string is considered in turn.
f        - Each field in the DOMAINLIST string is considered in turn.
*        - An attempt is made to match the template to each of the
*        target's Frames in the order: (1) the current Frame, (2) the
*        base Frame, (3) each remaining Frame in the order of being
*        added to the target FrameSet.
*        - Generally, the first match found is used. However, the
*        Mapping between the target coordinate system and the
*        resulting Frame is also examined. Preference is given to
*        cases where both the forward and inverse transformations are
*        defined (as indicated by the TranForward and TranInverse
*        attributes). If only one transformation is defined, the
*        forward one is preferred.
*        - If a match is found and the domain of the resulting Frame also
c        matches the current "domainlist" field, it is
f        matches the current DOMAINLIST field, it is
c        accepted. Otherwise, the next "domainlist" field is considered
f        accepted. Otherwise, the next DOMAINLIST field is considered
*        and the process repeated.
*
*        If a suitable coordinate system is found, the Current
*        attribute of the target FrameSet will be modified on exit to
*        identify the Frame whose match with the target was eventually
*        accepted.

*  Examples:
c     result = astFindFrame( target, astFrame( 3, "" ), "" );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFRAME( TARGET, AST_FRAME( 3, ' ', STATUS ), ' ', STATUS )
*        Searches for a 3-dimensional coordinate system in the target
*        Frame (or FrameSet). No attributes have been set in the
c        template Frame (created by astFrame), so no restriction has
f        template Frame (created by AST_FRAME), so no restriction has
*        been placed on the required coordinate system, other than
*        that it should have 3 dimensions. The first suitable Frame
c        found will be returned as part of the "result" FrameSet.
f        found will be returned as part of the RESULT FrameSet.
c     result = astFindFrame( target, astSkyFrame( "" ), "" );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFRAME( TARGET, AST_SKYFRAME( ' ', STATUS ), ' ', STATUS )
*        Searches for a celestial coordinate system in the target
*        Frame (or FrameSet). The type of celestial coordinate system
c        is unspecified, so astFindFrame will return the first one
f        is unspecified, so AST_FINDFRAME will return the first one
c        found as part of the "result" FrameSet. If the target is
f        found as part of the RESULT FrameSet. If the target is
*        a FrameSet, then its Current attribute will be updated to
*        identify the Frame that was used.
*
*        If no celestial coordinate system can be found, a value of
*        AST__NULL will be returned without error.
c     result = astFindFrame( target, astSkyFrame( "System=FK5" ), "" );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFRAME( TARGET, AST_SKYFRAME( 'System=FK5', STATUS ), ' ', STATUS )
*        Searches for an equatorial (FK5) coordinate system in the
*        target. The Equinox value for the coordinate system has not
*        been specified, so will be obtained from the target. If the
*        target is a FrameSet, its Current attribute will be updated
*        to indicate which SkyFrame was used to obtain this value.
c     result = astFindFrame( target, astFrame( 2, "" ), "sky,pixel," );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFRAME( TARGET, AST_FRAME( 2, ' ', STATUS ), 'SKY,PIXEL,', STATUS )
*        Searches for a 2-dimensional coordinate system in the
*        target. Initially, a search is made for a suitable coordinate
*        system whose Domain attribute has the value "SKY". If this
*        search fails, a search is then made for one with the domain
*        "PIXEL". If this also fails, then any 2-dimensional
c        coordinate system is returned as part of the "result"
f        coordinate system is returned as part of the RESULT
*        FrameSet.
*
*        Only if no 2-dimensional coordinate systems can be reached by
*        applying built-in conversions to any of the Frames in the
*        target will a value of AST__NULL be returned.
c     result = astFindFrame( target, astFrame( 1, "Domain=WAVELENGTH" ), "" );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFRAME( TARGET, AST_FRAME( 1, 'Domain=WAVELENGTH', STATUS ), ' ', STATUS )
*        Searches for any 1-dimensional coordinate system in the
*        target which has the domain "WAVELENGTH".
c     result = astFindFrame( target, astFrame( 1, "" ), "wavelength" );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFRAME( TARGET, AST_FRAME( 1, ' ', STATUS ), 'WAVELENGTH', STATUS )
*        This example has exactly the same effect as that above. It
*        illustrates the equivalence of the template's Domain attribute
c        and the fields in the "domainlist" string.
f        and the fields in the DOMAINLIST string.
c     result = astFindFrame( target, astFrame( 1, "MaxAxes=3" ), "" );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFRAME( TARGET, AST_FRAME( 1, 'MaxAxes=3', STATUS ), ' ', STATUS )
*        This is a more advanced example which will search for any
*        coordinate system in the target having 1, 2 or 3
c        dimensions. The Frame returned (as part of the "result"
f        dimensions. The Frame returned (as part of the RESULT
*        FrameSet) will always be 1-dimensional, but will be related
*        to the coordinate system that was found by a suitable Mapping
*        (e.g. a PermMap) which simply extracts the first axis.
*
*        If we had wanted a Frame representing the actual (1, 2 or
*        3-dimensional) coordinate system found, we could set the
*        PreserveAxes attribute to a non-zero value in the template.
c     result = astFindFrame( target, astSkyFrame( "Permute=0" ), "" );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFRAME( TARGET, AST_SKYFRAME( 'Permute=0', STATUS ), ' ', STATUS )
*        Searches for any celestial coordinate system in the target,
*        but only finds one if its axes are in the conventional
*        (longitude,latitude) order and have not been permuted
c        (e.g. with astPermAxes).
f        (e.g. with AST_PERMAXES).

*  Notes:
*     -  The Mapping represented by the returned FrameSet results in
*     alignment taking place in the coordinate system specified by the
c     AlignSystem attribute of the "template" Frame. See the description
f     AlignSystem attribute of the TEMPLATE Frame. See the description
*     of the AlignSystem attribute for further details.
*     - Beware of setting the Domain attribute of the template and then
c     using a "domainlist" string which does not include the template's domain
f     using a DOMAINLIST string which does not include the template's domain
*     (or a blank field). If you do so, no coordinate system will be
*     found.
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.

*  More on Using Templates:
*     A Frame (describing a coordinate system) will be found by this
*     function if (a) it is "matched" by the template you supply, and
c     (b) the value of its Domain attribute appears in the "domainlist"
f     (b) the value of its Domain attribute appears in the DOMAINLIST
*     string (except that a blank field in this string permits any
*     domain). A successful match by the template depends on a number
*     of criteria, as outlined below:
*     - In general, a template will only match another Frame which
*     belongs to the same class as the template, or to a derived (more
*     specialised) class. For example, a SkyFrame template will match
*     any other SkyFrame, but will not match a basic
*     Frame. Conversely, a basic Frame template will match any class
*     of Frame.
*     - If a template has a value set for any of its attributes, then
*     it will only match Frames which have an identical value for that
*     attribute (or which can be transformed, using a built-in
*     conversion, so that they have the required value for that
*     attribute). If any attribute in the template is un-set, however,
*     then Frames are matched regardless of the value they may have
*     for that attribute. You may therefore make a template more or
*     less specific by choosing the attributes for which you set
*     values.
*     - An important application of this principle involves the Domain
*     attribute. Setting the Domain attribute of the template has the
*     effect of restricting the search to a particular type of Frame
*     (with the domain you specify).  Conversely, if the Domain
*     attribute is not set in the template, then the domain of the
*     Frame found is not relevant, so all Frames are searched.  Note
*     that the
c     "domainlist" string provides an alternative way of restricting the
f     DOMAINLIST string provides an alternative way of restricting the
*     search in the same manner, but is a more convenient interface if
*     you wish to search automatically for another domain if the first
*     search fails.
*     - Normally, a template will only match a Frame which has the
*     same number of axes as itself. However, for some classes of
*     template, this default behaviour may be changed by means of the
*     MinAxes, MaxAxes and MatchEnd attributes. In addition, the
*     behaviour of a template may be influenced by its Permute and
*     PreserveAxes attributes, which control whether it matches Frames
*     whose axes have been permuted, and whether this permutation is
*     retained in the Frame which is returned (as opposed to returning
*     the axes in the order specified in the template, which is the
*     default behaviour). You should consult the descriptions of these
*     attributes for details of this more advanced use of templates.

*     This function returns a gap size which produces a nicely spaced
*     series of formatted values for a Frame axis, the returned gap
*     size being as close as possible to the supplied target gap
*     size. It also returns a convenient number of divisions into
*     which the gap can be divided.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     axis
*        The number of the axis (zero-based) for which a gap is to be found.
*     gap
*        The target gap size.
*     ntick
*        Address of an int in which to return a convenient number of
*        divisions into which the gap can be divided.

*  Returned Value:
*     The nice gap size.

*  Notes:
*     - A value of zero is returned if the target gap size is zero.
*     - A negative gap size is returned if the supplied gap size is negative.
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Description:
*     This function returns a pointer to the axis permutation array
*     for a Frame. This array constitutes a lookup-table that converts
*     between an axis number supplied externally and the corresponding
*     index in the Frame's internal axis arrays.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Frame.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the Frame's axis permutation array (a constant array
*     of int).  Each element of this contains the (zero-based)
*     internal axis index to be used in place of the external index
*     which is used to address the permutation array. If the Frame has
*     zero axes, this pointer will be NULL.

*  Notes:
*     - This protected method is provided to assist class
*     implementations which need to implement axis-dependent
*     extensions to Frame methods, and which therefore need to know
*     how a Frames's external axis index is converted for internal
*     use.
*     - The pointer returned by this function gives direct access to
*     data internal to the Frame object. It remains valid only so long
*     as the Frame exists. The permutation array contents may be
*     modified by other functions which operate on the Frame and this
*     may render the returned pointer invalid.
*     - A NULL pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*                   AstMapping **map, AstFrame **result )

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame method.

*  Description:
*     This function matches a "template" frame to a "target" frame and
*     determines whether it is possible to convert coordinates between
*     them.  If it is, a mapping that performs the transformation is
*     returned along with a new Frame that describes the coordinate
*     system that results when this mapping is applied to the "target"
*     coordinate system. In addition, information is returned to allow
*     the axes in this "result" Frame to be associated with the
*     corresponding axes in the "target" and "template" Frames from
*     which they are derived.

*  Parameters:
*     template
*        Pointer to the template Frame. This describes the coordinate
*        system (or set of possible coordinate systems) into which we
*        wish to convert our coordinates.
*     target
*        Pointer to the target Frame. This describes the coordinate
*        system in which we already have coordinates.
*     template_axes
*        Address of a location where a pointer to int will be returned
*        if the requested coordinate conversion is possible. This
*        pointer will point at a dynamically allocated array of
*        integers with one element for each axis of the "result" Frame
*        (see below). It must be freed by the caller (using astFree)
*        when no longer required.
*
*        For each axis in the result Frame, the corresponding element
*        of this array will return the (zero-based) index of the
*        template Frame axis from which it is derived. If it is not
*        derived from any template frame axis, a value of -1 will be
*        returned instead.
*     target_axes
*        Address of a location where a pointer to int will be returned
*        if the requested coordinate conversion is possible. This
*        pointer will point at a dynamically allocated array of
*        integers with one element for each axis of the "result" Frame
*        (see below). It must be freed by the caller (using astFree)
*        when no longer required.
*
*        For each axis in the result Frame, the corresponding element
*        of this array will return the (zero-based) index of the
*        target Frame axis from which it is derived. If it is not
*        derived from any target Frame axis, a value of -1 will be
*        returned instead.
*     map
*        Address of a location where a pointer to a new Mapping will
*        be returned if the requested coordinate conversion is
*        possible. If returned, the forward transformation of this
*        Mapping may be used to convert coordinates between the
*        "target" Frame and the "result" Frame (see below) and the
*        inverse transformation will convert in the opposite
*        direction.
*     result
*        Address of a location where a pointer to a new Frame will be
*        returned if the requested coordinate conversion is
*        possible. If returned, this Frame describes the coordinate
*        system that results from applying the returned Mapping
*        (above) to the "target" coordinate system. In general, this
*        Frame will combine attributes from (and will therefore be
*        more specific than) both the target and the template
*        Frames. In particular, when the template allows the
*        possibility of transformaing to any one of a set of
*        alternative coordinate systems, the "result" Frame will
*        indicate which of the alternatives was used.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if the requested coordinate
*     conversion is possible. Otherwise zero is returned (this will
*     not in itself result in an error condition).

*  Notes:
*     - By default, the "result" frame will have its number of axes
*     and axis order determined by the "template" Frame. However, if
*     the PreserveAxes attribute of the template frame is non-zero,
*     then the axis count and axis order of the "target" frame will be
*     used instead.
*     - The template_axes and target_axes arrays are provided so that
*     if the caller needs to permute the target and/or template axes
*     before invoking this function, it is possible to deduce how the
*     result axes should be permuted so as to correspond with the
*     original template/target axis order.
*     - For result axes that do not correspond with a template and/or
*     target axis (where a value of -1 is returned in the
*     template_axes and/or target_axes arrays), the caller has no
*     clear way of knowing where these axes should appear in any
*     permuted order. In this case, the relative position of these
*     axes within the result Frame (with respect to axes that do have
*     template/target axis associations) will be used to convey this
*     information. Such axes should be taken to be associated either
*     with the next preceding or following axis (depending on the
*     AST__MATCHEND flag of the template frame) which does have an
*     association.
*     - If the result Frame has zero axes, then NULL pointer values
*     will be returned for *template_axes and *target_axes.
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.
*-

*  Implementation Notes:
*     This implementation addresses the matching of a Frame class
*     object to other types of Frames (i.e. the target may be from a
*     derived class). A Frame will match any other type of Frame with
*     an acceptable number of axes but will not distinguish axis order
*     (i.e. it will match the axes in whatever order they are
*     given). If the template Frame has a value set for its Domain
*     attribute, then it will only match another Frame with the same
*     Domain.

*  Description:
*     This function modifies the Label and Symbol attributes of an Axis

*
*     If the axis has a set label, then we may be able to modify it to

*     if the original units were "Hz", the original label was "frequency",
*     and the new units are "log(Hz)", then the label is modified to become
*     "log( frequency )".
*
*     The Axis Format attribute is cleared if the supplied units are
*     different to the old units (because any set format is probably not
*     going to be appropriate for a new system of units.

*  Parameters:
*     ax

*                         AstMapping **map )

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame method.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new Frame whose axes are copies of axes
*     picked from an existing Frame. Other Frame attributes are also
*     copied to the new Frame. Zero or more of the original axes may
*     be picked in any order, but each can be used only
*     once. Additional axes (with default characteristics) may be
*     included in the new Frame if required.
*
*     Optionally, a Mapping that converts between the original Frame's
*     axes and those of the new Frame may also be returned.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the original Frame.
*     naxes
*        The number of axes required in the new Frame.
*     axes
*        Pointer to an array of int with naxes elements. This should
*        contain (zero based) axis indices specifying the axes which
*        are to be included in the new Frame, in the order
*        required. Each axis index may occur only once.
*
*        If additional (default) axes are also to be included, the
*        corresponding elements of this array should be set to -1.
*     map
*        Address of a location to receive a pointer to a new
*        Mapping. This will be a PermMap (or a UnitMap as a special
*        case) that describes the axis permutation that has taken
*        place between the original and new Frames.  The forward
*        transformation will convert from the original Frame's axes to
*        the new one's, and vice versa.
*
*        If this Mapping is not required, a NULL value may be supplied
*        for this parameter.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the new Frame.

*  Notes:
*     - The class of object returned may differ from that of the
*     original Frame, depending on which axes are selected. For
*     example, if a single axis is picked from a SkyFrame (which
*     always has two axes), the resulting Frame cannot be a valid
*     SkyFrame, so will revert to the parent class (Frame) instead.
*     - The new Frame contains a deep copy of all the data selected
*     from the original Frame. Modifying the new Frame will therefore
*     not affect the original one.
*     - A NULL pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the basic astPickAxes method

*        subsequent axis pemutations and the effects of combining
*        Frames, in order to reveal the original underlying axis
*        order).

*  Notes:
*     -  This protected method is provided so that class implementations can
*     distinguish the axes of frames from one another (e.g. can distinguish
*     a longitude axis as being different from a latitide axis) even after
*     their order has been permuted and they have been combined with axes from
*     other Frames.
*     -  The reference count of the primary Frame will be incremented by one to
*     reflect the new pointer returned.

*  Description:
*     This function reads a date/time string in a variety of formats and
*     returns the resulting time as a Modified Julian Date. If the string
*     cannot be interpreted as a date/time or contains invalid values, an
*     error is reported.

*  Parameters:

*        Pointer to a null terminated string containing the value to be read.

*  Returned Value:
*     The time as a Modified Julian date.

*  Date/Time Formats:
*     The date/time formats supported by this function are listed below. These
*     are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner and the function is
*     generally flexible about the presence of additional white space and the
*     use of alternative field delimiters.
*
*     Besselian Epoch
*        Expressed in decimal years, with or without decimal places
*        ("B1950" or "B1976.13", for example).
*     Julian Epoch
*        Expressed in decimal years, with or without decimal places
*        ("J2000" or "J2100.9", for example).
*     Year
*        Decimal years, with or without decimal places ("1996.8" for example).
*        Such values are interpreted as a Besselian epoch (see above) if less
*        than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch otherwise.
*     Julian Date
*        With or without decimal places ("JD 2454321.9" for example).
*     Modified Julian Date
*        With or without decimal places ("MJD 54321.4" for example).
*     Gregorian Calendar Date
*        With the month expressed as an integer or 3-character
*        abbreviation, and with optional decimal places to represent a
*        fraction of a day ("1996-10-2" or "1996-Oct-2.6" for
*        example). If no fractional part of a day is given, the time
*        refers to the start of the day (zero hours).
*     Gregorian Date and Time
*        Any calendar date (as above) but with a fraction of a day expressed
*        as hours, minutes and seconds ("1996-Oct-2 12:13:56.985" for example).

*  Notes:
*     -  The date/time value is interpreted as a calendar date and time, not
*     linked to any particular time system. Thus, interpretation of hours,
*     minutes and seconds is done in the obvious manner assuming 86400 seconds
*     in a day. No allowance for is made, for instance, for leap seconds or for
*     the varying length of a second in some time systems.
*     -  A value of AST__BAD is returned if this function is invoked with the
*     global error status set or if it should fail for any reason.

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame method.

*  Description:
*     This function takes a Frame and a set of vectors encapsulated
*     in a PointSet, and resolves each one into two orthogonal components,
*     returning these two components in another PointSet.
*
*     This is exactly the same as the public astResolve method, except
*     that this method allows many vectors to be processed in a single call,
*     thus reducing the computational cost of overheads of many
*     individual calls to astResolve.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     point1
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis
*        (Naxes attribute). This marks the start of the basis vector,
*        and of the vectors to be resolved.
*     point2
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis
*        (Naxes attribute). This marks the end of the basis vector.
*     in
*        Pointer to the PointSet holding the ends of the vectors to be
*        resolved.
*     out
*        Pointer to a PointSet which will hold the length of the two
*        resolved components. A NULL value may also be given, in which 
*        case a new PointSet will be created by this function.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the output (possibly new) PointSet. The first axis will 
*     hold the lengths of the vector components parallel to the basis vector. 
*     These values will be signed (positive values are in the same sense as 
*     movement from point 1 to point 2. The second axis will hold the lengths 
*     of the vector components perpendicular to the basis vector. These
*     values will always be positive.

*  Notes:
*     - The number of coordinate values per point in the input
*     PointSet must match the number of axes in the supplied Frame.
*     - If an output PointSet is supplied, it must have space for
*     sufficient number of points and 2 coordinate values per point.
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.
*     - We assume flat geometry throughout this function. Other classes,  
*     (e.g. SkyFrame) will override this method using more appropriate 
*     geometry.

*++
*  Name:
c     astSetActiveUnit
f     AST_SETACTIVEUNIT

*  Purpose:
*     Specify how the Unit attribute should be used.

*  Type:
*     Public virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "frame.h"
c     void astSetActiveUnit( AstFrame *this, int value )
f     CALL AST_SETACTIVEUNIT( THIS, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame method.

*  Description:
c     This function
f     This routine
*     sets the current value of the ActiveUnit flag for a Frame, which
*     controls how the Frame
c     behaves when it is used (by astFindFrame) as a template to match
c     another (target) Frame, or is used as the "to" Frame by astConvert.
f     behaves when it is used (by AST_FINDFRAME) as a template to match
f     another (target) Frame, or is used as the TO Frame by AST_CONVERT.
*     It determines if the Mapping between the template and target Frames
*     should take differences in axis units into account. The default value
*     for simple Frames is zero, which preserves the behaviour of versions
*     of AST prior to version 2.0.
*
c     If the ActiveUnit flag of the template Frame is zero, then the
f     If the ActiveUnit flag of the template Frame is .FALSE., then the
*     Mapping will ignore any difference in the Unit attributes of
*     corresponding template and target axes. In this mode, the Unit
*     attributes are purely descriptive commentary for the benefit of
*     human readers and do not influence the Mappings between Frames.
*     This is the behaviour which all Frames had in older version of AST,
*     prior to the introduction of this attribute.
*
c     If the ActiveUnit flag of the template Frame is non-zero, then the
f     If the ActiveUnit flag of the template Frame is .TRUE., then the
*     Mapping from template to target will take account of any difference
*     in the axis Unit attributes, where-ever possible. For instance, if
*     corresponding target and template axes have Unit strings of "km" and
*     "m", then the FrameSet class will use a ZoomMap to connect them
*     which introduces a scaling of 1000. If no Mapping can be found
*     between the corresponding units string, then an error is reported.
*     In this mode, it is assumed that values of the Unit attribute conform
*     to the syntax for units strings described in the FITS WCS Paper I
*     "Representations of world coordinates in FITS" (Greisen & Calabretta).
*     Particularly, any of the named unit symbols, functions, operators or
*     standard multiplier prefixes listed within that paper can be used within
*     a units string. A units string may contain symbols for unit which are
*     not listed in the FITS paper, but transformation to any other units
*     will then not be possible (except to units which depend only on the
*     same unknown units - thus "flops" can be transformed to "Mflops"
*     even though "flops" is not a standard FITS unit symbol).
*
c     If the ActiveUnit flag is non-zero, setting a new Unit value for an
f     If the ActiveUnit flag is .TRUE., setting a new Unit value for an
*     axis may also change its Label and Symbol attributes. For instance, if
*     an axis has Unit "Hz" and Label "frequency", then changing its Unit to
*     "log(Hz)" will change its Label to "log( frequency )". In addition,
*     the Axis Format attribute will be cleared when-ever a new value
*     is assigned to the Unit attribute.
*
c     Note, if a non-zero value is set for the ActiveUnit flag, then changing a
f     Note, if a .TRUE. value is set for the ActiveUnit flag, then changing a
*     Unit value for the current Frame within a FrameSet will result in the
*     Frame being re-mapped (that is, the Mappings which define the
*     relationships between Frames within the FrameSet will be modified to
*     take into account the change in Units).

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Frame.
c     value
f     VALUE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        The new value to use.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Applicability:
*     SpecFrame
c        The ActiveUnit flag for a SpecFrame is always 1 (any value
c        supplied using this function is ignored).
f        The ActiveUnit flag for a SpecFrame is always .TRUE. (any value
f        supplied using this routine is ignored).

*  Notes:
*     - The ActiveUnit flag resembles a Frame attribute, except that it
*     cannot be tested or cleared, and it cannot be accessed using the
c     generic astGet<X> and astSet<X> functions.
f     generic AST_GET<X> and AST_SET<X> routines.
c     - The astGetActiveUnit function can be used to retrieve the current
f     - The AST_GETACTIVEUNIT routine can be used to retrieve the current
*     value of the ActiveUnit flag.

*                      AstFrame **result )

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame method.

*  Description:
*     This function selects a requested sub-set (or super-set) of the axes from
*     a "target" Frame and creates a new Frame with copies of the selected
*     axes assembled in the requested order. It then optionally overlays the
*     attributes of a "template" Frame on to the result. It returns both the
*     resulting Frame and a Mapping that describes how to convert between the
*     coordinate systems described by the target and result Frames. If
*     necessary, this Mapping takes account of any differences in the Frames'
*     attributes due to the influence of the template.

*  Parameters:
*     target
*        Pointer to the target Frame, from which axes are to be selected.
*     template
*        Pointer to the template Frame, from which new attributes for the
*        result Frame are to be obtained. Optionally, this may be NULL, in
*        which case no overlaying of template attributes will be performed.
*     result_naxes
*        Number of axes to be selected from the target Frame. This number may
*        be greater than or less than the number of axes in this Frame (or
*        equal).
*     target_axes
*        Pointer to an array of int with result_naxes elements, giving a list
*        of the (zero-based) axis indices of the axes to be selected from the
*        target Frame. The order in which these are given determines the order
*        in which the axes appear in the result Frame. If any of the values in
*        this array is set to -1, the corresponding result axis will not be
*        derived from the target Frame, but will be assigned default attributes
*        instead.
*     template_axes
*        Pointer to an array of int with result_naxes elements. This should
*        contain a list of the template axes (given as zero-based axis indices)
*        with which the axes of the result Frame are to be associated. This
*        array determines which axes are used when overlaying axis-dependent
*        attributes of the template on to the result. If any element of this
*        array is set to -1, the corresponding result axis will not receive any
*        template attributes.
*
*        If the template argument is given as NULL, this array is not used and
*        a NULL pointer may also be supplied here.
*     map
*        Address of a location to receive a pointer to the returned Mapping.
*        The forward transformation of this Mapping will describe how to
*        convert coordinates from the coordinate system described by the target
*        Frame to that described by the result Frame. The inverse
*        transformation will convert in the opposite direction.
*     result
*        Address of a location to receive a pointer to the result Frame.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if coordinate conversion is
*     possible between the target and the result Frame. Otherwise zero
*     is returned and *map and *result are returned as NULL (but this
*     will not in itself result in an error condition). In general,
*     coordinate conversion should always be possible if no template
*     Frame is supplied but may not always be possible otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     - Any axis selection is currently permitted. Probably this
*     should be restricted so that each axis can only be selected
*     once. The astValidateAxisSelection method will do this but
*     currently there are bugs in the CmpFrame class that cause axis
*     selections which will not pass this test. Install the validation
*     when these are fixed.
*-

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This implementation addresses the selection of axes from a
*     Frame class object. This simply results in another object of the
*     same class and a Mapping which describes an axis permutation (or
*     a unit Mapping as a special case). Changes of Frame attributes
*     have no significance for coordinate values in this class, so do
*     not affect the Mapping returned.

*  Description:
*     This function reads a formatted coordinate value for a Frame
*     axis (supplied as a string) and returns the equivalent numerical
*     value as a double. It also returns the number of characters read
*     from the string.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     axis
*        The number of the Frame axis for which the coordinate value
*        is to be read (axis numbering starts at zero for the first
*        axis).
*     string
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        formatted coordinate value.
*     value
*        Pointer to a double in which the coordinate value read will be
*        returned.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of characters read from the string to obtain the
*     coordinate value.

*  Notes:
*     - Any white space at the beginning of the string will be
*     skipped, as also will any trailing white space following the
*     coordinate value read. The function's return value will reflect
*     this.
*     - A function value of zero (and no coordinate value) will be
*     returned, without error, if the string supplied does not contain
*     a suitably formatted value.
*     - The string "<bad>" is recognised as a special case and will
*     generate the value AST__BAD, without error. The test for this
*     string is case-insensitive and permits embedded white space.
*     - A function result of zero will be returned and no coordinate
*     value will be returned via the "value" pointer if this function
*     is invoked with the global error status set, or if it should
*     fail for any reason.

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the basic astUnformat method

*  Name:

*  Purpose:

*  Type:

*  Synopsis:
*     Integer (boolean).

*  Description:
*     This attribute is a boolean value which suggests how the axes of
*     a Frame should be displayed (e.g.) in graphical output. By
*     default, it has the value one, indicating that they should be
*     shown in the conventional sense (increasing left to right for an
*     abscissa, and bottom to top for an ordinate). If set to zero,
*     this attribute indicates that the direction should be reversed,
*     as would often be done for an astronomical magnitude or a right
*     ascension axis.

*  Applicability:
*     Frame
*        The default Direction value supplied by the Frame class is 1,
*        indicating that all axes should be displayed in the
*        conventional direction.
*     SkyFrame
*        The SkyFrame class re-defines the default Direction value to
*        suggest that certain axes (e.g. right ascension) should be
*        plotted in reverse when appropriate.
*     FrameSet
*        The Direction attribute of a FrameSet axis is the same as
*        that of its current Frame (as specified by the Current
*        attribute).

*  Notes:
*     - When specifying this attribute by name, it should be
*     subscripted with the number of the Frame axis to which it
*     applies.
*     - The Direction attribute does not directly affect the behaviour
*     of the AST library. Instead, it serves as a hint to applications
*     programs about the orientation in which they may wish to display
*     any data associated with the Frame. Applications are free to

*att++
*  Name:
*     Epoch

*  Purpose:
*     Epoch of observation.

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     Floating point.

*  Description:
*     This attribute is used to qualify the coordinate systems described by
*     a Frame, by giving the moment in time when the coordinates are known
*     to be correct. Often, this will be the date of observation, and is
*     important in cases where coordinates systems move with respect to each
*     other over the course of time.
*
*     The Epoch attribute is stored as a Modified Julian Date, but
*     when setting its value it may be given in a variety of
*     formats. See the "Input Formats" section (below) for details.

*  Input Formats:
*     The formats accepted when setting an Epoch value are listed
*     below. They are all case-insensitive and are generally tolerant
*     of extra white space and alternative field delimiters:
*
*     - Besselian Epoch: Expressed in decimal years, with or without
*     decimal places ("B1950" or "B1976.13" for example).
*
*     - Julian Epoch: Expressed in decimal years, with or without
*     decimal places ("J2000" or "J2100.9" for example).
*
*     - Year: Decimal years, with or without decimal places ("1996.8"
*     for example).  Such values are interpreted as a Besselian epoch
*     (see above) if less than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch otherwise.
*
*     - Julian Date: With or without decimal places ("JD 2454321.9" for
*     example).
*
*     - Modified Julian Date: With or without decimal places
*     ("MJD 54321.4" for example).
*
*     - Gregorian Calendar Date: With the month expressed either as an
*     integer or a 3-character abbreviation, and with optional decimal
*     places to represent a fraction of a day ("1996-10-2" or
*     "1996-Oct-2.6" for example). If no fractional part of a day is
*     given, the time refers to the start of the day (zero hours).
*
*     - Gregorian Date and Time: Any calendar date (as above) but with
*     a fraction of a day expressed as hours, minutes and seconds
*     ("1996-Oct-2 12:13:56.985" for example).

*  Output Format:
*     When enquiring Epoch values, the format used is the "Year"
*     format described under "Input Formats". This is a value in
*     decimal years which will be a Besselian epoch if less than
*     1984.0 and a Julian epoch otherwise.  By omitting any character
*     prefix, this format allows the Epoch value to be obtained as
*     either a character string or a floating point value.

*  Applicability:
*     Frame
*        All Frames have this attribute. The basic Frame class provides
*        a default of J2000.0 (Julian) but makes no use of the Epoch value.
*        This is because the Frame class does not distinguish between
*        different Cartesian coordinate systems (see the System attribute).
*     CmpFrame
*        The default Epoch value for a CmpFrame is selected as follows;
*        if the Epoch attribute has been set in the first component Frame
*        then the Epoch value from the first component Frame is used as
*        the default for the CmpFrame. Otherwise, if the Epoch attribute has
*        been set in the second component Frame then the Epoch value from the
*        second component Frame is used as the default for the CmpFrame.
*        Otherwise, the default Epoch value from the first component
*        Frame is used as the default for the CmpFrame.
*     FrameSet
*        The Epoch attribute of a FrameSet is the same as that of its current
*        Frame (as specified by the Current attribute).
*     SkyFrame
*        The coordinates of sources within a SkyFrame can changed with time
*        for various reasons, including: (i) changing aberration of light
*        caused by the observer's velocity (e.g. due to the Earth's motion
*        around the Sun), (ii) changing gravitational deflection by the Sun
*        due to changes in the observer's position with time, (iii) fictitious
*        motion due to rotation of non-inertial coordinate systems (e.g. the
*        old FK4 system), and (iv) proper motion of the source itself (although
*        this last effect is not handled by the SkyFrame class because it
*        affects individual sources rather than the coordinate system as
*        a whole).
*
*        The default Epoch value in a SkyFrame is B1950.0 (Besselian) for the
*        old FK4-based coordinate systems (see the System attribute) and
*        J2000.0 (Julian) for all others.
*
*        Care must be taken to distinguish the Epoch value, which relates to
*        motion (or apparent motion) of the source, from the superficially
*        similar Equinox value. The latter is used to qualify a coordinate
*        system which is itself in motion in a (notionally) predictable way
*        as a result of being referred to a slowly moving reference plane
*        (e.g. the equator).
*
*        See the description of the System attribute for details of which
*        qualifying attributes apply to each celestial coordinate system.

*  Name:
*     Format(axis)

*  Purpose:
*     Format specification for axis values.

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     String.

*  Description:
*     This attribute specifies the format to be used when displaying
*     coordinate values associated with a particular Frame axis
*     (i.e. to convert values from binary to character form). It is
c     interpreted by the astFormat function and determines the
f     interpreted by the AST_FORMAT function and determines the
*     formatting which it applies.
*
*     If no Format value is set for a Frame axis, a default value is
*     supplied instead. This is based on the value of the Digits, or
*     Digits(axis), attribute and is chosen so that it displays the
*     requested number of digits of precision.

*  Applicability:
*     Frame
*        The Frame class interprets this attribute as a format
*        specification string to be passed to the C "printf" function
*        (e.g. "%1.7G") in order to format a single coordinate value
*        (supplied as a double precision number).
c
c        When supplying a value for this attribute, beware that the
c        "%" character may be interpreted directly as a format
c        specification by some printf-like functions (such as
c        astSet). You may need to double it (i.e. use "%%") to avoid
c        this.
*     SkyFrame
*        The SkyFrame class re-defines the syntax and default value of
*        the Format string to allow the formatting of sexagesimal
*        values as appropriate for the particular celestial coordinate
*        system being represented. The syntax of SkyFrame Format
*        strings is described (below) in the "SkyFrame Formats"
*        section.
*     FrameSet
*        The Format attribute of a FrameSet axis is the same as that
*        of its current Frame (as specified by the Current
*        attribute). Note that the syntax of the Format string is also
*        determined by the current Frame.

*  SkyFrame Formats:
*     The Format string supplied for a SkyFrame should contain zero or
*     more of the following characters. These may occur in any order,
*     but the following is recommended for clarity:
*
*     - "+": Indicates that a plus sign should be prefixed to positive
*     values. By default, no plus sign is used.
*
*     - "z": Indicates that leading zeros should be prefixed to the
*     value so that the first field is of constant width, as would be
*     required in a fixed-width table (leading zeros are always
*     prefixed to any fields that follow). By default, no leading
*     zeros are added.
*
*     - "i": Use the standard ISO field separator (a colon) between
*     fields. This is the default behaviour.
*
*     - "b": Use a blank to separate fields.
*
*     - "l": Use a letter ("h"/"d", "m" or "s" as appropriate) to
*     separate fields.
*
*     - "g": Use a letter and symbols to separate fields ("h"/"d", "m" or "s",
*     etc, as appropriate), but include escape sequences in the formatted 
*     value so that the Plot class will draw the separators as small
*     super-scripts.
*
*     - "d": Include a degrees field. Expressing the angle purely in
*     degrees is also the default if none of "h", "m", "s" or "t" are
*     given.
*
*     - "h": Express the angle as a time and include an hours field
*     (where 24 hours correspond to 360 degrees). Expressing the angle
*     purely in hours is also the default if "t" is given without
*     either "m" or "s".
*
*     - "m": Include a minutes field. By default this is not included.
*
*     - "s": Include a seconds field. By default this is not included.
*     This request is ignored if "d" or "h" is given, unless a minutes
*     field is also included.
*
*     - "t": Express the angle as a time (where 24 hours correspond to
*     360 degrees). This option is ignored if either "d" or "h" is
*     given and is intended for use where the value is to be expressed
*     purely in minutes and/or seconds of time (with no hours
*     field). If "t" is given without "d", "h", "m" or "s" being
*     present, then it is equivalent to "h".
*
*     - ".": Indicates that decimal places are to be given for the
*     final field in the formatted string (whichever field this
*     is). The "." should be followed immediately by an unsigned
*     integer which gives the number of decimal places required, or by an
*     asterisk. If an asterisk is supplied, a default number of decimal
*     places is used which is based on the value of the Digits 
*     attribute. 
*
*     All of the above format specifiers are case-insensitive. If
*     several characters make conflicting requests (e.g. if both "i"
*     and "b" appear), then the character occurring last takes
*     precedence, except that "d" and "h" always override "t".

*     This attribute contains a string which identifies the physical
*     domain of the coordinate system that a Frame describes.
*
*     The Domain attribute also controls how a Frame behaves when it is
c     used (by astFindFrame) as a template to match another (target)
f     used (by AST_FINDFRAME) as a template to match another (target)
*     Frame. It does this by specifying the Domain that the target
*     Frame should have in order to match the template. If the Domain
*     value in the template Frame is set, then only targets with the
*     same Domain value will be matched. If the template's Domain
*     value is not set, however, then the target's Domain will be
*     ignored.

*  Applicability:
*     Frame
*        The default Domain value supplied by the Frame class is an
*        empty string.
*     SkyFrame
*        The SkyFrame class re-defines the default Domain value to be
*        "SKY".
*     CmpFrame
*        The CmpFrame class re-defines the default Domain value to be
*        of the form "<dom1>-<dom2>", where <dom1> and <dom2> are the
*        Domains of the two component Frames. If both these Domains are
*        blank, then the string "CMP" is used as the default Domain name.
*     FrameSet
*        The Domain attribute of a FrameSet is the same as that of its
*        current Frame (as specified by the Current attribute).
*     SpecFrame
*        The SpecFrame class re-defines the default Domain value to be
*        "SPECTRUM".

*  Notes:
*     - All Domain values are converted to upper case and white space
*     is removed before use.

f     behaves when it is used (by AST_FINDFRAME) as a template to match

*  Name:
*     System

*  Purpose:
*     Coordinate system used to describe positions within the domain

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     String.

*  Description:
*     In general it is possible for positions within a given physical
*     domain to be described using one of several different coordinate
*     systems. For instance, the SkyFrame class can use galactic
*     coordinates, equatorial coordinates, etc, to describe positions on
*     the sky. As another example, the SpecFrame class can use frequency,
*     wavelength, velocity, etc, to describe a position within an
*     electromagnetic spectrum. The System attribute identifies the particular
*     coordinate system represented by a Frame. Each class of Frame
*     defines a set of acceptable values for this attribute, as listed
*     below (all are case insensitive). Where more than one alternative
*     System value is shown, the first of will be returned when an
*     enquiry is made.

*  Applicability:
*     Frame
*        The System attribute for a basic Frame always equals "Cartesian",
*        and may not be altered.
*     CmpFrame
*        The System attribute for a CmpFrame always equals "Compound",
*        and may not be altered. In addition, the CmpFrame class allows
*        the System attribute to be referenced for a component Frame by
*        including the index of an axis within the required component
*        Frame. For instance, "System(3)" refers to the System attribute
*        of the component Frame which includes axis 3 of the CmpFrame.
*     FrameSet
*        The System attribute of a FrameSet is the same as that of its
*        current Frame (as specified by the Current attribute).
*     SkyFrame
*        The SkyFrame class supports the following System values and
*        associated celestial coordinate systems:
*
*        - "ICRS": The Internation Celestial Reference System, realised
*        through the Hipparcos catalogue. Whilst not an equatorial system
*        by definition, the ICRS is very close to the FK5 (J2000) system
*        and is usually treated as an equatorial system. The distinction
*        between ICRS and FK5 (J2000) only becomes important when accuracies
*        of 50 milli-arcseconds or better are required. ICRS need not be
*        qualified by an Equinox value.
*
*        - "FK4": The old FK4 (barycentric) equatorial coordinate system,
*        which should be qualified by an Equinox value. The underlying
*        model on which this is based is non-inertial and rotates slowly
*        with time, so for accurate work FK4 coordinate systems should
*        also be qualified by an Epoch value.
*
*        - "FK4-NO-E" or "FK4_NO_E": The old FK4 (barycentric) equatorial
*        system but without the "E-terms of aberration" (e.g. some radio
*        catalogues). This coordinate system should also be qualified by
*        both an Equinox and an Epoch value.
*
*        - "FK5" or "EQUATORIAL": The modern FK5 (barycentric) equatorial
*        coordinate system. This should be qualified by an Equinox value.
*
*        - "J2000": An equatorial coordinate system based on the mean
*        dynamical equator and equinox of the J2000 epoch. The dynamical
*        equator and equinox differ slightly from those used by the FK5
*        model, and so a "J2000" SkyFrame will differ slightly from an
*        "FK5(Equinox=J2000)" SkyFrame. The J2000 System need not be 
*        qualified by an Equinox value
*
*        - "GAPPT", "GEOCENTRIC" or "APPARENT": The geocentric apparent
*        equatorial coordinate system, which gives the apparent positions
*        of sources relative to the true plane of the Earth's equator and
*        the equinox (the coordinate origin) at a time specified by the
*        qualifying Epoch value. (Note that no Equinox is needed to
*        qualify this coordinate system because no model "mean equinox"
*        is involved.)  These coordinates give the apparent right
*        ascension and declination of a source for a specified date of
*        observation, and therefore form an approximate basis for
*        pointing a telescope. Note, however, that they are applicable to
*        a fictitious observer at the Earth's centre, and therefore
*        ignore such effects as atmospheric refraction and the (normally
*        much smaller) aberration of light due to the rotational velocity
*        of the Earth's surface.  Geocentric apparent coordinates are
*        derived from the standard FK5 (J2000.0) barycentric coordinates
*        by taking account of the gravitational deflection of light by
*        the Sun (usually small), the aberration of light caused by the
*        motion of the Earth's centre with respect to the barycentre
*        (larger), and the precession and nutation of the Earth's spin
*        axis (normally larger still).
*
*        - "ECLIPTIC": Ecliptic coordinates (IAU 1980), referred to the
*        ecliptic and mean equinox specified by the qualifying Equinox
*        value.
*
*        - "HELIOECLIPTIC": Ecliptic coordinates (IAU 1980), referred to the
*        ecliptic and mean equinox of J2000.0, in which an offset is added to
*        the longitude value which results in the centre of the sun being at 
*        zero longitude at the date given by the Epoch attribute. Attempts to 
*        set a value for the Equinox attribute will be ignored, since this 
*        system is always referred to J2000.0.
*
*        - "GALACTIC": Galactic coordinates (IAU 1958).
*
*        - "SUPERGALACTIC": De Vaucouleurs Supergalactic coordinates.
*
*        - "UNKNOWN": Any other general spherical coordinate system. No
*        Mapping can be created between a pair of SkyFrames if either of the
*        SkyFrames has System set to "Unknown".
*
*        Currently, the default System value is "ICRS". However, this
*        default may change in future as new astrometric standards
*        evolve. The intention is to track the most modern appropriate
*        standard. For this reason, you should use the default only if
*        this is what you intend (and can tolerate any associated slight
*        change in future). If you intend to use the ICRS system
*        indefinitely, then you should specify it explicitly.
*     SpecFrame
*        The SpecFrame class supports the following System values and
*        associated spectral coordinate systems (the default is "WAVE" -
*        wavelength). They are all defined in FITS-WCS paper III:
*
*        - "FREQ": Frequency (GHz)
*        - "ENER" or "ENERGY": Energy (J)
*        - "WAVN" or "WAVENUM": Wave-number (1/m)
*        - "WAVE" or "WAVELEN": Vacuum wave-length (Angstrom)
*        - "AWAV" or "AIRWAVE": Wave-length in air (Angstrom)
*        - "VRAD" or "VRADIO": Radio velocity (km/s)
*        - "VOPT" or "VOPTICAL": Optical velocity (km/s)
*        - "ZOPT" or "REDSHIFT": Reshift (dimensionless)
*        - "BETA": Beta factor (dimensionless)
*        - "VELO" or "VREL": Apparent radial ("relativistic") velocity (km/s)
*
*        The default value for the Unit attribute for each system is shown
*        in parentheses. Note that the default value for the ActiveUnit flag
c        is non-zero
f        is .TRUE.
*        for a SpecFrame, meaning that changes to the Unit attribute for
*        a SpecFrame will result in the SpecFrame being re-mapped within
*        its enclosing FrameSet in order to reflect the change in units
c        (see astSetActiveUnit function for further information).
f        (see AST_SETACTIVEUNIT routine for further information).
*     FluxFrame
*        The FluxFrame class supports the following System values and
*        associated systems for measuring observed value:
*
*        - "FLUXDEN": Flux density in frequency units (W/m^2/Hz)
*        - "FLUXDENW": Flux density in wavelength units (W/m^2/Angstrom)
*
*        The above lists specified the default units for each System. If an 
*        explicit value is set for the Unit attribute but no value is set 
*        for System, then the default System value is determined by the Unit 
*        string (if the units are not appropriate for describing any of the 
*        supported Systems then an error will be reported when an attempt is 
*        made to access the System value). If no value has been specified for
*        either Unit or System, then System=FLUXDEN and Unit=W/m^2/Hz are
*        used.

*     This function creates a new Frame and optionally initialises its
*     attributes.

*  Parameters:
*     naxes
*        The number of Frame axes.
*     options
*        Pointer to a null terminated string containing an optional
*        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
*        initialising the new Frame. The syntax used is the same as
*        for the astSet method and may include "printf" format
*        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.
*     ...
*        If the "options" string contains "%" format specifiers, then
*        an optional list of arguments may follow it in order to
*        supply values to be substituted for these specifiers. The
*        rules for supplying these are identical to those for the
*        astSet method (and for the C "printf" function).

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Frame.

*  Notes:
*     - A NULL pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.
*-

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the basic Frame constructor which is
*     available via the protected interface to the Frame class.  A
*     public interface is provided by the astFrameId_ function.

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame initialiser.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided for use by class implementations to initialise
*     a new Frame object. It allocates memory (if necessary) to accommodate
*     the Frame plus any additional data associated with the derived class.
*     It then initialises a Frame structure at the start of this memory. If
*     the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a virtual
*     function table for a Frame at the start of the memory passed via the
*     "vtab" parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory in which the Frame is to be created. This
*        must be of sufficient size to accommodate the Frame data
*        (sizeof(Frame)) plus any data used by the derived class. If a value
*        of NULL is given, this function will allocate the memory itself using
*        the "size" parameter to determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the Frame (plus derived class data).
*        This will be used to allocate memory if a value of NULL is given for
*        the "mem" parameter. This value is also stored in the Frame
*        structure, so a valid value must be supplied even if not required for
*        allocating memory.
*     init
*        A logical flag indicating if the Frame's virtual function table is
*        to be initialised. If this value is non-zero, the virtual function
*        table will be initialised by this function.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be associated
*        with the new Frame.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which contains
*        the name of the class to which the new object belongs (it is this
*        pointer value that will subsequently be returned by the astGetClass
*        method).
*     naxes
*        The number of Frame axes.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Frame.

*  Notes:
*     -  A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked with the

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame loader.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided to load a new Frame using data read
*     from a Channel. It first loads the data used by the parent class
*     (which allocates memory if necessary) and then initialises a
*     Frame structure in this memory, using data read from the input
*     Channel.
*
*     If the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a
*     virtual function table for a Frame at the start of the memory
*     passed via the "vtab" parameter.


*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory into which the Frame is to be loaded.
*        This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the Frame data
*        (sizeof(Frame)) plus any data used by derived classes. If a
*        value of NULL is given, this function will allocate the
*        memory itself using the "size" parameter to determine its
*        size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the Frame (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of
*        NULL is given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also
*        stored in the Frame structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "size" value is ignored
*        and sizeof(AstFrame) is used instead.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be
*        associated with the new Frame. If this is NULL, a pointer to
*        the (static) virtual function table for the Frame class is
*        used instead.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which
*        contains the name of the class to which the new object
*        belongs (it is this pointer value that will subsequently be
*        returned by the astGetClass method).
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "name" value is ignored
*        and a pointer to the string "Frame" is used instead.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Frame.

*  Notes:
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any

*  Description:
c     This function returns a pointer to a string containing the
f     This function returns a character string containing the
*     formatted (character) version of a coordinate value for a Frame
*     axis. The formatting applied is determined by the Frame's
*     attributes and, in particular, by any Format attribute string
*     that has been set for the axis. A suitable default format (based
*     on the Digits attribute value) will be applied if necessary.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (given)
*        Pointer to the Frame.
c     axis
f     AXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the Frame axis for which formatting is to be
*        performed (axis numbering starts at 1 for the first axis).
c     value
f     VALUE = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The coordinate value to be formatted.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astFormat()
c        A pointer to a null-terminated string containing the formatted
c        value.
f     AST_FORMAT = CHARACTER * ( AST__SZCHR )
f        The formatted value.

*  Notes:
c     - The returned pointer is guaranteed to remain valid and the
c     string to which it points will not be over-written for a total
c     of 50 successive invocations of this function. After this, the
c     memory containing the string may be re-used, so a copy of the
c     string should be made if it is needed for longer than this.
c     - A formatted value may be converted back into a numerical (double)
c     value using astUnformat.
f     - A formatted value may be converted back into a numerical
f     (double precision) value using AST_UNFORMAT.
c     - A NULL pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
c     with the AST error status set, or if it should fail for any
c     reason.
f     - A blank string will be returned if this function is invoked
f     with STATUS set to an error value, or if it should fail for any
f     reason.

*  Implementation Notes:
*     This function implements the public interface for the astFormat

*
*     - The axis index is decremented by 1 before use. This allows the
*     public interface to use 1-based axis numbers (whereas internally
*     axis numbers are zero-based).
*
*     - The returned string value is buffered in dynamically allocated
*     memory so that it will remain valid for a guaranteed number of
*     function invocations.

*++

f     AST_FRAME

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Frame.

*  Type:
*     Public function.

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "frame.h"
c     AstFrame *astFrame( int naxes, const char *options, ... )
f     RESULT = AST_FRAME( NAXES, OPTIONS, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Frame constructor.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new Frame and optionally initialises its
*     attributes.
*
*     A Frame is used to represent a coordinate system. It does this
*     in rather the same way that a frame around a graph describes the
*     coordinate space in which data are plotted. Consequently, a
*     Frame has a Title (string) attribute, which describes the
*     coordinate space, and contains axes which in turn hold
*     information such as Label and Units strings which are used for
*     labelling (e.g.) graphical output. In general, however, the
*     number of axes is not restricted to two.
*
*     Functions are available for converting Frame coordinate values
*     into a form suitable for display, and also for calculating
*     distances and offsets between positions within the Frame.
*
*     Frames may also contain knowledge of how to transform to and
*     from related coordinate systems.

*  Parameters:
c     naxes
f     NAXES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of Frame axes (i.e. the number of dimensions of
*        the coordinate space which the Frame describes).
c     options
f     OPTIONS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing an optional
c        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
c        initialising the new Frame. The syntax used is identical to
c        that for the astSet function and may include "printf" format
c        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.
c        If no initialisation is required, a zero-length string may be
c        supplied.
f        A character string containing an optional comma-separated
f        list of attribute assignments to be used for initialising the
f        new Frame. The syntax used is identical to that for the
f        AST_SET routine. If no initialisation is required, a blank
f        value may be supplied.
c     ...
c        If the "options" string contains "%" format specifiers, then
c        an optional list of additional arguments may follow it in
c        order to supply values to be substituted for these
c        specifiers. The rules for supplying these are identical to
c        those for the astSet function (and for the C "printf"
c        function).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astFrame()
f     AST_FRAME = INTEGER
*        A pointer to the new Frame.

*  Examples:
c     frame = astFrame( 2, "Title=Energy Spectrum: Plot %d", n );
c        Creates a new 2-dimensional Frame and initialises its Title
c        attribute to the string "Energy Spectrum: Plot <n>", where
c        <n> takes the value of the int variable "n".
c     frame = astFrame( 2, "Label(1)=Energy, Label(2)=Response" );
c        Creates a new 2-dimensional Frame and initialises its axis
c        Label attributes to suitable string values.
f     FRAME = AST_FRAME( 2, 'Title=Energy Spectrum', STATUS );
f        Creates a new 2-dimensional Frame and initialises its Title
f        attribute to the string "Energy Spectrum".
f     FRAME = AST_FRAME( 2, 'Label(1)=Energy, Label(2)=Response', STATUS );
f        Creates a new 2-dimensional Frame and initialises its axis
f        Label attributes to suitable string values.

*  Notes:
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.
*--

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the external (public) interface to
*     the astFrame constructor function. It returns an ID value
*     (instead of a true C pointer) to external users, and must be
*     provided because astFrame_ has a variable argument list which
*     cannot be encapsulated in a macro (where this conversion would
*     otherwise occur).
*     - The variable argument list also prevents this function from
*     invoking astFrame_ directly, so it must be a re-implementation
*     of it in all respects, except for the final conversion of the
*     result to an ID value.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new Frame whose axes are copied from an
*     existing Frame along with other Frame attributes, such as its
*     Title. Any number (zero or more) of the original Frame's axes
*     may be copied, in any order, and additional axes with default

*
c     Optionally, a Mapping that converts between the coordinate
f     A Mapping that converts between the coordinate
*     systems described by the two Frames will also be returned.

*  Parameters:

f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the original Frame.
c     naxes
f     NAXES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of axes required in the new Frame.
c     axes

c        An array, with "naxes" elements, which lists the axes to be
f        An array which lists the axes to be
*        copied. These should be given in the order required in the
*        new Frame, using the axis numbering in the original Frame
*        (which starts at 1 for the first axis). Axes may be selected
*        in any order, but each may only be used once.  If additional
*        (default) axes are also to be included, the corresponding
*        elements of this array should be set to zero.

f     MAP = INTEGER (Returned)

*        case) that describes the axis permutation that has taken
*        place between the original and new Frames. The Mapping's
*        forward transformation will convert coordinates from the
*        original Frame into the new one, and vice versa.
c
c        If this Mapping is not required, a NULL value may be supplied
c        for this parameter.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astPickAxes()
f     AST_PICKAXES = INTEGER
*        A pointer to the new Frame.

*  Notes:
*     - The class of Frame returned may differ from that of the
*     original Frame, depending on which axes are selected. For
*     example, if a single axis is picked from a SkyFrame (which must
*     always have two axes) then the resulting Frame cannot be a valid
*     SkyFrame, so will revert to the parent class (Frame) instead.
c     - The new Frame will contain a "deep" copy (c.f. astCopy) of all
f     - The new Frame will contain a "deep" copy (c.f. AST_COPY) of all
*     the data selected from the original Frame. Modifying any aspect
*     of the new Frame will therefore not affect the original one.
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.

*  Description:
c     This function reads a formatted coordinate value (given as a

c     The principle use of this function is in decoding user-supplied
c     input which contains formatted coordinate values. Free-format
c     input is supported as far as possible. If input is ambiguous, it

*  Parameters:

f        A character string containing the formatted coordinate value.
*        This string may contain additional information following the

*        Any white space before or after the value is discarded.
c     value
f     VALUE = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
c        Pointer to a double in which the coordinate value read will be
c        returned.
f        The coordinate value read.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astUnformat()
f     AST_UNFORMAT = INTEGER
*        The number of characters read from the string in order to
*        obtain the coordinate value. This will include any white
*        space which occurs before or after the value.

*  Applicability:
*     Frame
*        This function applies to all Frames. See the "Frame Input
*        Format" section below for details of the input formats
*        accepted by a basic Frame.
*     SkyFrame
*        The SkyFrame class re-defines the input format to be suitable
*        for representing angles and times, with the resulting
*        coordinate value returned in radians.  See the "SkyFrame
*        Input Format" section below for details of the formats
*        accepted.
*     FrameSet
*        The input formats accepted by a FrameSet are determined by
*        its current Frame (as specified by the Current attribute).

*  Frame Input Format
*     The input format accepted for a basic Frame axis is as follows:
*     - An optional sign, followed by:
*     - A sequence of one or more digits possibly containing a decimal point,
*     followed by:
*     - An optional exponent field.
*     - The exponent field, if present, consists of "E" or "e"
*     followed by a possibly signed integer.
*
*     Examples of acceptable Frame input formats include:
*     - 99
*     - 1.25
*     - -1.6
*     - 1E8
*     - -.99e-17
*     - <bad>

*  SkyFrame Input Format
*     The input format accepted for a SkyFrame axis is as follows:
*     - An optional sign, followed by between one and three fields
*     representing either degrees, arc-minutes, arc-seconds or hours,
*     minutes, seconds (e.g. "-12 42 03").
*     - Each field should consist of a sequence of one or more digits,
*     which may include leading zeros. At most one field may contain a
*     decimal point, in which case it is taken to be the final field
*     (e.g. decimal degrees might be given as "124.707", while degrees
*     and decimal arc-minutes might be given as "-13 33.8").
*     - The first field given may take any value, allowing angles and
*     times outside the conventional ranges to be
*     represented. However, subsequent fields must have values of less
*     than 60 (e.g. "720 45 31" is valid, whereas "11 45 61" is not).
*     - Fields may be separated by white space or by ":" (colon), but
*     the choice of separator must be used consistently throughout the
*     value. Additional white space may be present around fields and
*     separators (e.g. "- 2: 04 : 7.1").
*     - The following field identification characters may be used as
*     separators to replace either of those above (or may be appended
*     to the final field), in order to identify the field to which
*     they are appended: "d"---degrees; "h"---hours; "m"---minutes of
*     arc or time; "s"---seconds of arc or time; "'" (single
*     quote)---minutes of arc; """ (double quote)---seconds of arc.
*     Either lower or upper case may be used.  Fields must be given in
*     order of decreasing significance (e.g. "-11D 3' 14.4"" or
*     "22h14m11.2s").
*     - The presence of any of the field identification characters
*     "d", "'" (single quote) or """ (double quote) indicates that the
*     value is to be interpreted as an angle. Conversely, the presence
*     of "h" indicates that it is to be interpreted as a time (with 24
*     hours corresponding to 360 degrees). Incompatible angle/time
*     identification characters may not be mixed (e.g. "10h14'3"" is
*     not valid).  The remaining field identification characters and
*     separators do not specify a preference for an angle or a time
*     and may be used with either.
c     - If no preference for an angle or a time is expressed anywhere
c     within the value, it is interpreted as an angle if the Format
c     attribute string associated with the SkyFrame axis generates an
c     angle and as a time otherwise. This ensures that values produced
c     by astFormat are correctly interpreted by astUnformat.
f     - If no preference for an angle or a time is expressed anywhere
f     within the value, it is interpreted as an angle if the Format
f     attribute string associated with the SkyFrame axis generates an
f     angle and as a time otherwise. This ensures that values produced
f     by AST_FORMAT are correctly interpreted by AST_UNFORMAT.
*     - Fields may be omitted, in which case they default to zero. The
*     remaining fields may be identified by using appropriate field
*     identification characters (see above) and/or by adding extra
*     colon separators (e.g. "-05m13s" is equivalent to "-:05:13"). If
*     a field is not identified explicitly, it is assumed that
*     adjacent fields have been given, after taking account of any
*     extra separator characters (e.g. "14:25.4s" specifies minutes
*     and seconds, while "14::25.4s" specifies degrees and seconds).
c     - If fields are omitted in such a way that the remaining ones
c     cannot be identified uniquely (e.g. "01:02"), then the first
c     field (either given explicitly or implied by an extra leading
c     colon separator) is taken to be the most significant field that
c     astFormat would produce when formatting a value (using the
c     Format attribute associated with the SkyFrame axis).  By
c     default, this means that the first field will normally be
c     interpreted as degrees or hours. However, if this does not
c     result in consistent field identification, then the last field
c     (either given explicitly or implied by an extra trailing colon
c     separator) is taken to to be the least significant field that
c     astFormat would produce.
f     - If fields are omitted in such a way that the remaining ones
f     cannot be identified uniquely (e.g. "01:02"), then the first
f     field (either given explicitly or implied by an extra leading
f     colon separator) is taken to be the most significant field that
f     AST_FORMAT would produce when formatting a value (using the
f     Format attribute associated with the SkyFrame axis).  By
f     default, this means that the first field will normally be
f     interpreted as degrees or hours. However, if this does not
f     result in consistent field identification, then the last field
f     (either given explicitly or implied by an extra trailing colon
f     separator) is taken to to be the least significant field that
f     AST_FORMAT would produce.
*
c     This final convention is intended to ensure that values formatted
c     by astFormat which contain less than three fields will be
c     correctly interpreted if read back using astUnformat, even if
c     they do not contain field identification characters.
f     This final convention is intended to ensure that values formatted
f     by AST_FORMAT which contain less than three fields will be
f     correctly interpreted if read back using AST_UNFORMAT, even if
f     they do not contain field identification characters.
*
*     Examples of acceptable SkyFrame input formats (with
*     interpretation in parentheses) include:
*     - -14d 13m 22.2s (-14d 13' 22.2")
*     - + 12:34:56.7 (12d 34' 56.7" or 12h 34m 56.7s)
*     - 001 : 02 : 03.4 (1d 02' 03.4" or 1h 02m 03.4s)
*     - 22h 30 (22h 30m 00s)
*     - 136::10" (136d 00' 10" or 136h 00m 10s)
*     - -14M 27S (-0d 14' 27" or -0h 14m 27s)
*     - -:14: (-0d 14' 00" or -0h 14m 00s)
*     - -::4.1 (-0d 00' 04.1" or -0h 00m 04.1s)
*     - .9" (0d 00' 00.9")
*     - d12m (0d 12' 00")
*     - H 12:22.3s (0h 12m 22.3s)
*     - <bad> (AST__BAD)
*
*     Where alternative interpretations are shown, the choice of angle or
*     time depends on the associated Format(axis) attribute.

*  Notes:
*     - A function value of zero (and no coordinate value) will be
*     returned, without error, if the string supplied does not contain
*     a suitably formatted value.
c     - Beware that it is possible for a formatting error part-way
c     through an input string to terminate input before it has been
c     completely read, but to yield a coordinate value that appears
c     valid. For example, if a user types "1.5r6" instead of "1.5e6",
c     the "r" will terminate input, giving an incorrect coordinate
c     value of 1.5. It is therefore most important to check the return
c     value of this function to ensure that the correct number of
c     characters have been read.
f     - Beware that it is possible for a formatting error part-way
f     through an input string to terminate input before it has been
f     completely read, but to yield a coordinate value that appears
f     valid. For example, if a user types "1.5R6" instead of "1.5E6",
f     the "R" will terminate input, giving an incorrect coordinate
f     value of 1.5. It is therefore most important to check the return
f     value of this function to ensure that the correct number of
f     characters have been read.
*     - An error will result if a value is read which appears to have
*     the correct format, but which cannot be converted into a valid
*     coordinate value (for instance, because the value of one or more
*     of its fields is invalid).
*     - The string "<bad>" is recognised as a special case and will
*     yield the coordinate value AST__BAD without error. The test for
*     this string is case-insensitive and also permits embedded white
*     space.
c     - A function result of zero will be returned and no coordinate
c     value will be returned via the "value" pointer if this function
c     is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it should fail
c     for any reason.
f     - A function result of zero will be returned and no coordinate
f     value will be returned via the VALUE argument if this function
f     is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it should fail
f     for any reason.
