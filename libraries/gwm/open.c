F77_SUBROUTINE(gwm_open) ( CHARACTER(disply), LOGICAL(usedef),

/*
*+
*  Name:
*     GWM_OPEN
*
*  Purpose:
*     Establish the X client-server connection.
*
*  Language:
*     C
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL GWM_OPEN( DISPLY, USEDEF, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     Establish the X client-server connection. The display name
*     specifies the node on which the server is running. Most
*     applications will use the default device in which case the
*     logical argument USEDEF should be set to true and the display
*     name is ignored. An error handler is established which reports
*     errors via EMS. This routine has to be called before any of
*     the other GWM FORTRAN interface routines. The connection is
*     terminated by the routine GWM_CLOSE.
*
*  Arguments:
*     DISPLY = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Display name specifying the network node name and display
*        number of the workstation. The format of the name will be
*        "hostname:number<.screen>" if the transport mechanism is
*        TCP/IP or "hostname::number<.screen>" if the transport
*        mechanism is DECNET. The "hostname" is the name of the
*        host machine to which the display is physically connected.
*        The "number" is the number of the server on the host machine.
*        A single CPU can have one or more servers which are usually
*        numbered starting with zero. On a multiple-screen workstation
*        the optional "screen" number indicates the screen to use.
*        Examples are "cpu:0", "cpu::0", "cpu:0.1" or "cpu::0.1".
*        If USEDEF is true the display name is ignored.
*     USEDEF = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true use the default display, otherwise use the display
*        specified by the DISPLY argument.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
