GWM - X Graphics Window Manager

v1.5-1

Gnu autoconf version.

v1.5-0

This is a maintenance release of gwm. The only significant change is to
correct a problem with gwm windows which have allocated a private colour
map which could cause graphics applications to generate X errors.

This release of GWM adds support for windows created with visual types other 
than the default visual type of the display. The simple display manager 
distributed with the gwm library cannot create windows with alternative
visual types but they can be created with the tcl/tk based manager that
is distributed as part of startcl.
