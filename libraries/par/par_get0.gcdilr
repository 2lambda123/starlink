      SUBROUTINE PAR_GET0<T> ( PARAM, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PAR_GET0x

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a scalar value from a parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PAR_GET0x( PARAM, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine obtains a scalar value from a parameter.  If it is
*     necessary, the value is converted to the required type.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter name.
*     VALUE = ? (Returned)
*        The parameter value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each of the data types character,
*     double precision, integer, logical, and real: replace "x" in the
*     routine name by C, D, I, L, or R respectively as appropriate.  The
*     VALUE argument must have the corresponding data type.
*     -  Note that a scalar (zero-dimensional) parameter is different
*     from a vector (one-dimensional) parameter containing a single 
*     value.

*  Algorithm:
*     Call the underlying parameter-system primitives.
