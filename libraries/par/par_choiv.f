      SUBROUTINE PAR_CHOIV( PARAM, MAXVAL, OPTS, VALUES, ACTVAL,
     :                      STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     PAR_CHOIV

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains from a parameter a list of character values selected from
*     a menu of options.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PAR_CHOIV( PARAM, MAXVAL, OPTS, VALUES, ACTVAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine obtains a vector of character values from a
*     parameter.  Each value must be one of a supplied list of
*     acceptable values, and can be an abbreviation provided it is
*     unambiguous.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter.
*     MAXVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of values required.  A PAR__ERROR status is
*        returned when the number of values requested is less than one.
*     OPTS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The list of acceptable options for the values obtained from the
*        parameter.  Items should be separated by commas.  The list is
*        case-insensitive.
*     VALUES( MAXVAL ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The selected options from the list in the order supplied to the
*        parameter.  They are in uppercase and in full, even if an
*        abbreviation has been given for the actual parameter.
*     ACTVAL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The actual number of values obtained.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The search for a match of each obtained character value with an
*     item in the menu adheres to the following rules.
*        o  All comparisons are performed in uppercase.  Leading blanks
*        are ignored.
*        o  A match is found when the value equals the full name of an
*        option.  This enables an option to be the prefix of another
*        item without it being regarded as ambiguous.  For example,
*        "10,100,200" would be an acceptable list of options.
*        o  If there is no exact match, an abbreviation is acceptable.
*        A comparison is made of the value with each option for the
*        number of characters in the value.  The option that best fits
*        the value is declared a match, subject to two provisos.
*        Firstly, there must be no more than one character different
*        between the value and the start of the option.  (This allows
*        for a mistyped character.)  Secondly, there must be only one
*        best-fitting option.  Whenever these criteria are not
*        satisfied, the user is told of the error, and is presented
*        with the list of options, before being prompted for a new
*        value.
*        If a nearest match is selected, the user is informed unless the
*        MSG filtering level (see SUN/104) is 'quiet'.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  If the number of values is not positive then report the error
*     and exit.
*     -  Obtain the vector of values of the parameter.  Loop until a set
*     of acceptable values are obtained or an error condition exists.
*     Acceptable means it is in the menu and an unambiguous selection
*     was given.  If an unacceptable value is supplied an error is
*     reported immediately, and the list of options is reported.
