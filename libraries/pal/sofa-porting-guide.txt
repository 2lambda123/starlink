Some SLA routines migrate directly to SOFA so are not included in PAL

slaDranrm => iauAnp
slaDrange => iauAnpm


Some SLA routines are close to the same but have different arguments
so a PAL routine is provided although it is probably best to port software
to the SOFA variant:

slaDat =>palDat => iauDat
