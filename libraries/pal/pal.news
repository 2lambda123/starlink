PAL Library

The Starlink Positional Astronomy Library (PAL) is a C implementation of the
SLALIB API. It is distributed under the GPL and uses the SOFA library wherever
possible.

V0.1.1

The palDrange function has been modified so that it now returns +PI if
the supplied angle is +PI (previously, it returned -PI in these cases).


V0.1.0

Initial release with sufficient SLALIB API for AST and the Astro::Coords perl module.
