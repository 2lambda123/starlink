#  Name:
#     nbs_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against ADAM NBS.

#  Language:
#     {routine_language}

#  Type Of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building ADAM applications
#     which use NBS in order to generate the correct arguments for the
#     compiler (or ld) command. The arguments generated are written to
#     the standard output.

#  The Script May Be Invoked As Part Of A Command Such As:
#        alink program.f -L/star/lib `nbs_link_adam`
#
#     although the ADAM "alink" command will normally link against NBS
#     anyway.

#  Initialise the special options string.
      special=''

#  Test to see if we are on a system which requires additional
#  "special" ld options for correct linking.

#  DEC Alpha systems running OSF1:
#  ------------------------------
#  Ensure that allocated memory addresses will fit into 32 bits to
#  prevent problems with storing them in Fortran integers.
      if test "`uname -m`" = "alpha" -a "`uname -s`" = "OSF1"; then
         special='-Wl,-D -Wl,40800000 -Wl,-T -Wl,30000000'
      fi

#  Echo any special options, followed by the NBS library reference,
#  followed by the list of options for packages on which NBS depends.
#  Pass the result through an awk script to remove duplicate library
#  references.
      echo "${special}" -lnbs `ems_link_adam` `cnf_link_adam` \
           | awk '{for(f=NF;f;f--)if(!w[$f]++)l=$f" "l;print l}'

#  End of script.
