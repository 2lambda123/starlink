 *  Module name:
      NBS_TYP.H

 *  Function:
      Type definitions for noticeboard system.

 *  Description:
      The same types are used both internally and in noticeboard definition
      files. There is a complication with pointers since they are invalidated
      when data is moved to a different virtual address. Thus all pointers are
      relocated relative to a small positive integer when noticeboard
      definitions are saved to disc or copied to a global section. All
      processes accessing a given noticeboard take a private copy of all the
      pointers and relocate them so that they are valid pointers for that
      process. This allows direct access to noticeboard data using C
      structures.

      Apart from the above, the structure of a noticeboard definition is
      identical in private memory, in a global section and on disc. The basic
      data structure is the "item descriptor". This consists entirely of
      pointers and is the only structure that contains pointers (thus only item
      descriptors need relocating). It has the following structure.
      
	    Pointer to parent item descriptor 
	    Pointer to eldest child item descriptor
	    Pointer to next sibling item descriptor
	    Pointer to fixed information
	    Pointer to general noticeboard information
	    Pointer to shape information
	    Pointer to associated data
            Number of lower-level items accessed via this item
      
      The first pointers are to other item descriptors. It can be seen that an
      item gains access to its children by first going to its eldest child and
      then searching through its eldest child's siblings. This is simple but can
      be inefficient when there are many children (and results in very heavily
      nested recursive calls when relocating pointers).

      The other pointers are data structures, none of which contain any
      pointers. Because of this there is no need to take private copies of
      these structures and the always reside in the global section (any that
      can change must be in the global section anyway). The fixed information
      has the following structure.

	    Item name (up to 16 bytes, null-terminated if shorter)
	    Item type (up to 16 bytes, null-terminated if shorter)
	    Whether or not the item is primitive
	    Max dimensionality of item
	    Current dimensionality of item
	    Max size of item in bytes
	    Current size of item in bytes
	    Modified count (incremented before and after each modification)

      There is only one copy of the general noticeboard information per
      noticeboard. It has the following structure.

	    Software version creating file / noticeboard
            Size of noticeboard definition file (0 if no file)
      	    Size of definition part of noticeboard
	    Total size of noticeboard including data
	    PID of owner (first mapper) of this noticeboard
            Number of times noticeboard data has been modified

            Timeout count on find and get
            Timeout interval on find and get
            Whether everybody can write noticeboard
            Whether to increment modify count on put
            Whether to check modify count on get
      
            Channel number on which noticeboard definition file is open
            Address of start of noticeboard
            Name of file from which noticeboard was restored

      (The last three items are only used when updating noticeboard data to
      disc and are only meaningful to the noticeboard owner.)

      The shape information is simply an array of integers.

      The associated data is simply an array of bytes.

      The only assumption that is made about the relative placement of these
      structures within a noticeboard definition is that the item descriptor
      for the top-level item starts at offset zero. The data always starts
      at the byte following the last byte of the definition.
      
      (In fact it would be a good idea if the item descriptors were allocated
      in a separate contiguous part of memory. If this were done then mapping
      processes would need to take a copy only of the item descriptors,
      rather than of the entire definition. This is not possible at present
      because the item descriptors are all mixed in with the fixed information,
      the noticeboard information and the shape information.)

 *  Version date: 15-Feb-90
 *-
 *  History:
      03-Feb-86 - WFL - Original version
      17-Jul-87 - WFL - Ensure that MODIFIED is word-aligned with respect to
    		the rest of the structure. Also ensure that all structures
		are an integral number of words in length.
      21-Jul-87 - WFL - Add DEFN_SIZE, SECTION_SIZE and VERSION to BOARD_INFO.
		- WFL - Excise all mention of OTHER_SELF.
		- WFL - Token effort at saving space - make MAXDIMS and ACTDIMS
		into SHORT integers.
		- WFL - Move definition of VERSION to here.
      22-Jul-87 - WFL - Remove BASE from BOARD_INFO.
      06-Nov-87 - WFL - Portable VMS / UNIX version. Use strdescr macro to
    		decide whether to use VMS string descriptors or C strings.
      11-Feb-88 - WFL - Don't alter strdescr macro definition and use the
		c_string macro instead.
      16-Feb-88 - WFL - Add CHILDREN to FIXED_INFO, add MODIFIED to BOARD_INFO,
		and increment VERSION.
      25-Mar-88 - WFL - Add FILE_SIZE, SAVE_NAME and CHAN to BOARD_INFO and
	 	increment VERSION. Move file header definition from NBSLOW.
		- WFL - Add RESERVE fields to all data structures to minimise
		necessity for incrementing VERSION on all changes (and increment
		VERSION).
      20-May-88 - WFL - Add INT_ID type (type used for input integers - int
		for c_string, int* otherwise).
      01-Feb-90 - WFL - Add ACCESSED to ITEM_INFO, and TIMEOUT_COUNT,
		TIMEOUT_INTERVAL, WORLD_WRITE, INCREMENT_MODIFY and
		CHECK_MODIFY to BOARD_INFO; no need to alter VERSION
      06-Feb-90 - WFL - Use variant for ITEM_INFO PARENT/VALID and for
		DATA/ACCESSED; add ITEM_INFO TRIGGER and MODIFIED; add
		ORIGINAL_UNMAPPED
      07-Feb-90 - WFL - Add variant ITEM_INFO GLOBAL_BASE/SHAPE, with
		GLOBAL_BASE used only for top-level items
      15-Feb-90 - WFL - Remove TIMEOUT_COUNT and TIMEOUT_DELAY from BOARD_INFO
      19-Nov-93 - DJA - string_id removed in favour of F77 usage.
      24-Nov-94 - DJA - Allocated item sizes rounded up to long boundaries
      11-Sep-95 - DJA - Fixed bug in _ALIGN_ITEM macro
