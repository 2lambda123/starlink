*  History:

*        Original.
*     28-JUN-2004 (AA/TIMJ/NXG):
*        Symbols were undefined under Mac OSX and GCC 3.3, defining the pointer
*        to NULL fixed this (int's set to zero just in case). Looks to be from the
*        ISO-9899:1999 standard (section 6.9.2) (commonly refered to as C99) which 
*        declares that:
*
*        "A declaration of an identifier for an object that has file scope 
*        without an initializer, and without a storage-class specified for with 
*        the storage-class specifier static, constitutes a tentative definition. 
*        If a translation unit contains one or more tentative definitions for an
*        identifier, and the translation unit contains no external definitions for
*        that identifier, then the behaviour is exactly as if the translation unit
*        contains a file scope declaration of that identifier, with the composite
*        type as of the end of the translation unit, with an initializer equal to 0."
