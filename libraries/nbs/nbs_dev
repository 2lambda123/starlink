#  Name:
#     nbs_dev

#  Purpose:
#     Create or delete soft links to NBS include files

#  Language:
#     Unix C shell

#  Description:
#     Create or delete soft links in the current working directory that point
#     to include files needed when writing ADAM/Starlink programs. The names of
#     the soft links are in upper case.

#  Arguments:
#     Argument 1
#        This can be "remove" or can be omitted. If it is omitted, the soft
#        links are created, if it is "remove" they are removed.

#  Algorithm:
#     -  For each name in the list of file names:
#     -     If the first parameter to this script is null then
#     -        create a soft link with the name in upper case
#     -     Else if the first parameter is "remove" then
#     -        remove the soft link, which is in upper case
#     -     Else
#     -        print an error message and break out of the loop
