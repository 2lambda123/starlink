      SUBROUTINE PDA_C2NAG( NP, R, X, Y )
*+
*  Name:
*     PDA_C2NAG

*  Purpose:
*     Converts an FFTPACK complex Fourier transform array into
*     the equivalent NAG arrays.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PDA_C2NAG( NP, R, X, Y )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine re-orders and normalises the supplied array of
*     Fourier co-efficients (as produced by FFTPACK subroutine PDA_CFFTF)
*     so that the returned arrays looks like the equivalent arrays returned
*     by NAG routine C06FCE.
*
*     The real and imaginary co-efficients produced by PDA_CFFTF are numerically 
*     larger than the corresponding C06FCE co-efficients by a factor of 
*     SQRT( NP ), and are stored differently. NAG uses two separate
*     1-dimensional arrays to store the real and imaginary co-efficients, 
*     whereas FFTPACK stored them in a single two dimensional array (each 
*     row holds a pair of corresponding real and imaginary co-efficients).

*  Arguments:
*     NP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of points in the transform.
*     R( 2, NP ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input co-efficients, in FFTPACK format.
*     X( NP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The real co-efficients, in NAG format.
*     Y( NP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The imaginary co-efficients, in NAG format.

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER NP
      REAL    R( 2, NP )

*  Arguments Returned:
      REAL    X( NP )
      REAL    Y( NP )
      
*  Local Variables:

*.

*  Store the normalisation factor
      FAC = 1.0/SQRT( REAL( NP ) )

*  Loop round each pair of co-efficients.
      DO J = 1, NP

*  Normalise them and store them in the output arrays.
         X( J ) = FAC*R( 1, J )
         Y( J ) = FAC*R( 2, J )
