      SUBROUTINE PDA_QSIA<T>( EL, X, IP )
*+
*  Name:
*     PDA_QSIAx

*  Purpose:
*     Sort an array of pointers to access an array in ascending order.

*  Language:
*     Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PDA_QSIAx( EL, X, IP )

*  Description:
*     The routine uses the Quicksort algorithm to permute an array of
*     pointers so that they access an associated array of values in
*     ascending order.  The "median of three" modification is included
*     to reduce the likelihood of encountering the worst-case behaviour
*     of Quicksort.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements of X to sort.
*     X( EL ) = ? (Given)
*        The array to be sorted.
*     IP( EL ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The indices of the elements of X in sorted order (i.e. IP( 1 )
*        gives the index into X of the lowest value).

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for all numeric data types except unsigned
*     byte and word: replace "x" in the routine name by D, R, I, K, W,
*     or B as appropriate.  The data type of the X argument must match
*     the particular routine used.

*     -  Sedgwick, R., 1988, "Algorithms" (Addison-Wesley).

*  Timing:
*     If N elements are to be sorted, the average time goes as N.ln(N).
*     The worst-case time goes as N**2.

*  History:
*     11-Jan-1991 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     29-MAY-1992 (RFWS):
*        Modified to permute a separate pointer array. Also added the
*        "median of three" enhancement and the use of a sentinel value
*        to avoid having to check array bounds within the innermost
*        loop.
*     1-JUN-1992 (RFWS):
*        Added exchange sort to find the median of three partition
*        element.
*     6-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Rationalised the inner loop to improve performance.
*     8-NOV-1995 (PDRAPER):
*        Renamed to PDA_QSIA (Quick Sort Indexed Ascending) for 
*        the PDA library. Now returns the index of the first 1..N
*        elements of X.
*     2009 August 21 (MJC):
*        Made generic.
*     2012 May 9 (MJC):
*        Document 64-bit integer support.
