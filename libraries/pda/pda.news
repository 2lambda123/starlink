 The Public Domain Algorithms' Library (PDA), which is intended to 
 replace the NAG library in Starlink application code, has been 
 upgraded to include 30 new routines in the areas of:

 o  Matrices.
 o  Minimisation.
 o  Normal distribution.
 o  Pseudo-random numbers.
 o  Simple statistics.
 o  Sorting.
 o  Two-dimensional interpolation and fitting.

 A new link script `pda_link_adam` is included which should be used to
 link ADAM tasks with PDA. The `pda_link` script is still available but
 should now be used only to link stand-alone (i.e. not ADAM) programs.
 This brings PDA into line with other Starlink libraries.

 Full details of the release are given in the updated Starlink 
 User Note SUN/194.2.
