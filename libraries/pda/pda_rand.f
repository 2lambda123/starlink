      REAL FUNCTION PDA_RAND( X )
*+
*  Name:
*     PDA_RAND
 
*  Purpose:
*     Returns pseudo-random numbers in the range 0 to 1.
      
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = PDA_RAND( X )

*  Description:
*     This is a simple random number generator providing deviates in the
*     range 0 to 1, with period of 2**26, and to 6 or 7 digits
*     accuracy.  It is based upon Ahrens, Dieter & Grube's TOMS599
*     routines.  Note that there is no STATUS argument for efficiency.

*  Arguments:
*     X = REAL (Given)
*        This is a dummy variable required by the Fortran standard.

*  Returned Value:
*     PDA_RAND = REAL
*        The pseudo-random deviate.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The initial seed MUST be set using routine PDA_RNSED (equivalent
*     to NAG's G05CBF).  If it has not, there is no guarantee that
*     sensible values will be returned from this function.

*  Algorithm:
*     A multiplicative congruential generator of the form
*
*        R := MOD( R * FACTOR, 1 )
*
*     The factor is the integer of the form 8 * K + 5 (K positive
*     integer) nearest to to  2**26 * ( sqrt(5) - 1 )/2 (the so called
*     `golden section').  The initial seed is defined by PDA_RNSED.
