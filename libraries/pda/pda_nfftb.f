      SUBROUTINE PDA_NFFTB( NDIM, DIM, X, Y, WORK, ISTAT )
*+
*  Name:
*     PDA_NFFTB

*  Purpose:
*     Take the backward FFT of an N-dimensional complex array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PDA_NFFTB( NDIM, DIM, X, Y, WORK, ISTAT )

*  Description:
*     The supplied Fourier co-efficients in X and Y are replaced by the 
*     corresponding spatial data obtained by doing an inverse Fourier
*     transform. See the forward FFT routine PDA_NFFTF for more details.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions. This should be no more than 20.
*     DIM( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of each dimension.
*     X( * ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Supplied holding the real parts of the Fourier co-efficients.
*        Returned holding the real parts of the spatial data. The array 
*        should have the number of elements implied by NDIM and DIM.
*     Y( * ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Supplied holding the imaginary parts of the Fourier co-efficients.
*        Returned holding the imaginary parts of the spatial data. The array 
*        should have the number of elements implied by NDIM and DIM.
*     WORK( * ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        A work array. This should have at least ( 6*DimMax + 15 )
*        elements where DimMax is the maximum of the values supplied in
*        DIM.
*     ISTAT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        If the value of NDIM is greater than 20 or less than 1, then
*        ISTAT is returned equal to 1, and the values in X and Y are
*        left unchanged. Otherwise, ISTAT is returned equal to 0.
