#     pda_link

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against the ADAM version
#     of the PDA library.

#  Language:
#     Bourne Shell

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a compiler command line,
#     such as:
#
#        alink program.f -L/star/lib `pda_link_adam`

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building ADAM
