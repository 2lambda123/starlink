\section{Introduction}\label{in}

Almost any program that does any graphics requires the user to identify which
graphics device is to be used. When the graphics package used by the program is
GKS (\xref{SUN/83}{sun83}{})---and for the majority of Starlink 
software it is, at least indirectly---graphics devices are
identified by two integers, a `workstation type' and a `connection
identifier'. (`Workstation' is GKS terminology for a graphics device of any
description and this is the sense in which it is used throughout this
note.) No one can be expected to remember the workstation types of all the
devices supported by Starlink (nearly 50 at present) so a library has been
provided that translates `friendly' and easy to remember names into their GKS
equivalents.

Most high level graphics packages, such as SGS \xref{SUN/85}{sun85}{})
and PGPLOT \xref{SUN/15}{sun15}{}), call GNS to
perform the necessary name translation when a workstation is opened, so
unless you are writing programs that open GKS workstations directly
(by calling {\tt GOPWK}), or need to make specialised device inquiries,
you will not need to call any GNS routines yourself.

The graphics workstation name service library provides three sorts of service
to the users and writers of graphics subroutine libraries and applications 
programs:

\begin{itemize}

\item The translation of workstation names to their GKS equivalents.

\item Generating a list of the names and types of the graphics devices
available on a system.

\item Answering a variety of enquiries about the properties of a particular
graphics device; for example, its category (pen plotter, image display
etc.) or its device name.

\end{itemize}

GNS also provides support for the Image Display Interface 
(IDI---\xref{SUN/65}{sun65}{}) and the
Applications Graphics Interface (AGI---\xref{SUN/48}{sun48}{}), 
but in both cases the use of GNS
is internal to the librariy and so its presence is not normally
apparent to the programmer.

\section{Workstation Names}\label{wn}
\subsection{\xlabel{GKSWorkstationNames}GKS Names}

A GKS workstation name is a character string that represents a graphics device
that may be opened and manipulated using GKS. 
The simplest way to get a list of valid workstation names is to run the
\hyperref{demonstration program}{demonstration program (section~}{}{demo-prog}).
When you supply a workstation name to a program that uses GNS (either directly
or indirectly via a high level graphics package) you can abbreviate the name
provided that the abbreviation is not ambiguous. You can also supply a
environment variable that translates to a workstation name; this can be 
used to create ``nicknames'' for devices that you use frequently.

Each workstation name identifies a device type and may also identify a
particular device (or file). For example, the workstation name {\tt cifer\_t5}
might translate to {\tt 801} (the GKS workstation type for a Cifer T5
terminal), while {\tt ps\_l} might translate to {\tt 2700} and {\tt gks74.ps}
(the GKS workstation type and the usual file name of a landscape
orientation PostScript printer file). 

If a name translates to just a workstation type then a  ``default'' device
is used. All device types have a default device name associated with them,
and this is most important for terminals where the default is the terminal
from which the program is being run. In this case the default device name
depends on which terminal is being used.

The device name implied by a workstation name can be overridden by
appending a semicolon followed by a new device or file name to the
workstation name. For example, the name {\tt ps\_l;plot.ps} would use {\tt
plot.ps} instead of {\tt gks74.ps}. 

If an explicit device name is supplied there are no checks made to ensure
that the device is the right type; attempting to use the wrong type will
either cause the attempt to open the GKS workstation to fail or garbage to
be sent to the device.

An application program can also override the device name {\em implied\/} by a
workstation name; if it does, the program's documentation should make this
clear. An application cannot override a device name which is supplied
{\em explicitly\/} as part of a workstation name.

It is also possible to specify an explicit GKS device type and connection
identifier as a pair of integers separated by a comma, space or underscore. If
the connection identifier is omitted, it defaults to zero.

Finally, a workstation name can be an environment
variable that translates to a valid workstation name (which can be another
environment variable). Any explicit device
name is removed before the translation is attempted and the first device name
encountered is the one that is used; any subsequent device names are ignored.
Environment variable translation continues recursively until either no 
translation is found or the resulting name begins with ``{\tt{GKS\_}}''.

\subsection{\xlabel{IDIWorkstationNames}IDI Names}

An IDI workstation (or device) name is simply a character string (for example,
{\tt xwindows}) which identifies an image display and its type. The default 
device name can be overridden by appending a semicolon followed by the new
device name after the workstation name. 
Environment variables can be set up and
translation proceeds recursively until a name is found that does not
translate to another name.

\subsection{GWM windows}

There are some special features of GNS that apply to GWM window devices;
these are X window display devices under the control of the Graphics
Window Manager (\xref{SUN/130}{sun130}{}). 
All GWM windows have a name (usually displayed in the title
bar) which need not be the same as the workstation name supplied at a prompt
or as an argument to a routine such as 
\htmlref{GNS\_TNG}{GNS_TNG}. This window name is the one
that is supplied as an argument to the 
\xref{xmake}{sun130}{xmakeCommand} or 
\xref{xdestroy}{sun130}{xdestroyCommand} commands. When a
GWM window is accessed through GNS (for both GKS and IDI) the supplied
workstation name is translated into a GWM window with a default name. For
instance the workstation name "xwindows" usually translates into a window
named "xwindows". Note that the GKS workstation name "xoverlay" also
translates into a window named "xwindows" because the overlay device is part
of the same GWM window.

Both GKS and IDI will create a new GWM window with the default name
if one does not already exist. The default window name can be overridden
by using the device name field of the workstation name. The device name
field is separated from the workstation name by a semi-colon; thus the
string `xw;bert' is parsed into the workstation name `xw' and the device
name `bert'. The device name supersedes the default and so a window
named `bert' is used rather than one named `xwindows'

By default a GWM window created by a GKS or IDI graphics application
will not have an overlay plane unless the overlay option is specified
in the \xref{X defaults file}{sun130}{xdefaults}
\begin{latexonly}
(see SUN.130)
\end{latexonly}. 
The user can request that a window is created
with an overlay plane by appending a `+' to the name when prompted for
it. Thus the workstation name `xwindows+' or `xw+' will result in a
GWM window with an overlay. Note that when using GKS specifying `xw+'
will create a window with an overlay, but the drawing will be done in
the base plane (specifying `xoverlay' automatically results in a window
with an overlay).

\subsection{Demonstration Program}\label{demo-prog}

A complete list of all the GKSworkstation names defined on your current node can
be obtained by running the program 
{\tt /star/bin/examples/gnsrun\_gks}\footnote{If
you are running this software on a non-Starlink system you may have to 
replace {\tt /star} with some other path name.}. 
After listing all the GKS names along with a short description of each
workstation, the program prompts for a workstation name. If one of the names
in the list (or any other valid workstation name) is entered, a simple
demonstration picture is plotted on the device selected. 

A similar program called {\tt gnsrun\_idi} will also be available if the
IDI library has been installed on the system.

If running either program produces any unexpected error messages
you should report them to your system manager; however, you should not
necessarily expect all workstations on the lists to be useable. A device could,
for example, be in use by someone else.

\section{Database Management}\label{dm}
\subsection{Workstation Names}\label{dwn}

It is the responsibility of the system manager to set up and maintain the
database of workstation name translations.
This section describes the structure of the database and the modifications
that the system manager typically has to make when installing the system.

\subsubsection{GKS Names}\label{GKS-names}

The GKS workstation names are stored in a text file which is found by looking
in turn for:
\begin{itemize}
\item The translation of the environment variable {\tt GNS\_GNSNAMES}.
\item A file called {\tt gns\_gksnames} in a directory found by 
translating the environment variable {\tt GNS\_DIR}.
\item A file called {\tt ../etc/gns\_gksnames} relative to each directory
on the PATH.
\end{itemize}
Each line in the file describes one workstation name
and contains the name, the GKS workstation type that it translates to, the
device name of the workstation, a short description of the workstation and,
optionally, the network node from which the device is accessible and a
sequence number (see \hyperref{this section}{section~}{}{seqno}). The
fields are separated by the slash ({\tt/}) character and a complete record
might look like:
\begin{verbatim}
      IKON_A/3200/XAA0:/Ikon Image display A/NODEA/ 1/
\end{verbatim}
However, the device name field is usually blank which means that the
default device associated with the workstation type is used, the node field
will usually be blank as it is only used on VMS systems 
and the sequence number will normally be absent;
so most records in the file will be more like:
\begin{verbatim}
      tek4010/201/ /Tektronix 4010 terminal/
\end{verbatim}
An explicit device name is only required when you need different names for two
or more devices of the same type. 

For X window devices the device name is used as the GWM window name, and the
sequence number should be left blank. 
\begin{verbatim}
      xwindows/3800/xwindows/X Windows/
\end{verbatim}

The system is distributed with a file containing a name for every workstation
type supported by RAL-GKS and so will work without any modification. However,
programs that list the available workstations will
present users with a long list of workstation names, many of which
are probably not available, so the first task is to delete from the 
file the definitions for devices that are not available on your system. 

As well as eliminating extraneous names from listings of available workstations
this will also make abbreviations more useful. For example, some of the 
names are somewhat unwieldy because they have to be able to distinguish between
different devices made by the same manufacturer such as {\tt cifer\_t5} for the
Cifer T5 terminal and {\tt cifer\_2634} for the Cifer 2634. If, on a system with
only one sort of Cifer terminal the unwanted name is deleted, then {\tt
cifer} becomes an acceptable abbreviation.

Having edited {\tt gns\_gksnames} you should test the system by 
running the
demonstration program described in section \ref{demo-prog}. 

\subsubsection{IDI Names}

The IDI workstation names are stored in a text file which is opened in the
same way as the GKS names files but with GKS replaced by IDI.
Each line in the file describes one workstation name
and contains the name, the IDI workstation type that it translates to (a two
or three character code), the
device name of the workstation, a short description of the workstation and,
optionally, the network node from which the device is accessible and a
sequence number (see \hyperref{this section}{section~}{}{seqno}). For example:
\begin{verbatim}
      xwindows/XW/xwindows/X Windows/ / /
      x2windows/XW2/xwindows2/X Windows/ / /
\end{verbatim}
The use of the node name field is the same as for GKS names
(see \hyperref{this section}{section~}{}{GKS-names}). 
For X window devices the first two characters
of the workstation type must be 'XW', the device name is a string (up to
10 characters) which is used as the GWM window name, and the sequence
number should be left blank.

\subsubsection{\label{seqno}Sequence numbers}

The sequence number can be thought of as a kind of serial number which
uniquely identifies a device. The main purpose of the sequence number
is to identify multiple names that refer to the same
physical device (or workstation window). 
Each device has to have its own sequence
number as in the following GKS example:
\begin{verbatim}
      xwindows/   3800/xwindows/X window 1/ / 1/
      xoverlay/ 3805/xwindows/X window 1/ / 1/ 
      xwindows2/   3801/xwindows2/X window 2/ / 2/
      xoverlay2/ 3806/xwindows2/X window 2/ / 2/
\end{verbatim}
The sequence number refers to the physical device, so that devices that
have multiple names should have the same sequence number. This also
applies to devices that have multiple GKS workstation types, such as an
overlay plane, or image display with VT terminal interface.

If a sequence number has been set in the {\tt gns\_gksnames} file and the same
device has an entry in the {\tt gns\_idinames} file then it should be given
the same sequence number (and vice versa). That is if a device supports
both GKS and IDI then the sequence number should be the same in both files.
Continuing the previous example the {\tt gns\_idinames} file would have
the following entries:
\begin{verbatim}
      xwindows/   XW/xwindows/X window 1/ / 1/
      xwindows2/  XW2/xwindows2/X window 2/ / 2/
\end{verbatim}

A sequence number is an integer in the range 1 to 99. If the sequence number
is not present in the database then a default value of 0 is used.

\subsection{Workstation Description Table}\label{wdt}

\subsubsection{GKS Descriptions}

The workstation description file only needs to be modified if a new device type
is supported by GKS so this section will only be of interest to someone adding
a new workstation handler.

The workstation description table is stored in a binary file 
{\tt gns\_gksdevices} (located in a similar way to the names files).
This binary file is built from a text version of the
description table by running the program {\tt gksbuild}. ({\tt gksbuild}
is not normally installed and must be created by re-building the
gns libary.)

The description table distributed with the system contains an entry for every
workstation type supported by GKS-UK and is built from the text file {\tt
gksdevices.txt} which can be used as a template for any changes or
additions.

The text file looks something like:

\begin{verbatim}
      WORKSTATION = 10
         CLASS = METAFILE_INPUT
         OUTPUT =  FILE
      WORKSTATION = 50
         CLASS = METAFILE_OUTPUT
         OUTPUT = FILE
      WORKSTATION = 101
         CLASS = TERMINAL
         SCALE = 3.3833E-4
         OUTPUT = DIRECT
         CLEAR = SELECTIVE
\end{verbatim}

Each workstation description starts with {\tt WORKSTATION =} {\em type} and
contains a list of statements of the form {\em keyword} {\tt =} {\em value}.

The value field takes one of the following forms:
\begin{description}
\item[Integer] A decimal integer.
\item[Real] A real number constructed according to the usual FORTRAN rules but
without any imbedded spaces.
\item[Keyword] A character keyword.
\item[Character string] A character string delimited by the first non-space 
character following the equals sign and the next occurrence of that same 
character.
When character strings are being interpreted the {\tt\char94} character is used
as an ``escape'' character for inserting control characters (e.g. control Z
(ASCII 26) is represented by {\tt\char94 Z}). A literal {\tt\char94} character
is represented by {\tt\char94\char94}.
\end{description}

The only mandatory keyword is {\tt CLASS} which indicates to which category of
device the workstation belongs and must have one of the following
keywords as its value:

\begin{quote}{\tt
GRAPHICS\_OVERLAY\\
IMAGE\_DISPLAY\\
IMAGE\_OVERLAY \footnotetext{an image overlay is a graphics overlay 
that is also capable of plotting cell arrays}\\
MATRIX\_PRINTER\\
METAFILE\_INPUT\\
METAFILE\_OUTPUT\\
PEN\_PLOTTER\\
TERMINAL\\
WINDOW\\
WINDOW\_OVERLAY}
\end{quote}

For all workstation types other than those of class {\tt TERMINAL}, {\tt
METAFILE\_\-INPUT} and {\tt METAFILE\_\-OUTPUT} the keyword {\tt
DEFAULT\_NAME} is also mandatory. The value must be the name of the
device used when the workstation is opened with a connection identifier of
0. For devices of class {\tt TERMINAL} the logged-on terminal is used in
these circumstances. 

Other keywords describe such things as the
approximate size of ``device units'' and a character string that can be
used to clear the text screen of a terminal.

A complete list of all the keywords that can appear in the description file
can be found in \hyperref{this appendix}{appendix~}{}{key}.

\subsubsection{IDI Descriptions}

There is an equivalent description file for IDI stored in a binary file
{\tt gns\_ididevices} (located in a similar way to the names files).
This binary file is built from a text version of the description table by
running {\tt idibuild}. At present the description table only
contains one entry which is the {\tt AGITYPE}; this is mandatory for an IDI
workstation. The text file looks something like:

\begin{verbatim}
      WORKSTATION = /XW/
         AGITYPE = 3800
      WORKSTATION = /XW2/
         AGITYPE = 3801

\section{Error Messages}\label{er}

All GNS routines use the so called {\em inherited status strategy}
(see \xref{SUN/104}{sun104}{}), which means
that if the {\tt STATUS} argument is not set to the value {\tt SAI\_\_OK}
(equals zero) on entry the routine will exit without performing any action. If
an error occurs during the execution of a routine, {\tt STATUS} will be set to
one of the values defined in the FORTRAN include file {\tt GNS\_ERR}.

\section{Compiling and Linking Programs with GNS}\label{cl}

To include either of the GNS include files, create links in the directory
containing the program source code with the command:
\begin{quote}{\tt
gns\_dev}
\end{quote}
and use and include statement such as:
\begin{verbatim}
      INCLUDE 'GNS_ERR'
      INCLUDE 'GNS_PAR'
\end{verbatim}

The link procedures for most high level graphics packages (e.g. IDI, SGS etc.)
already contain a reference to GNS. Programs that do not link with such
packages can be linked to GNS by using the shell script gns\_link
or gns\_link\_adam. For example to compile and link an ADAM task called
`task.f' the following is used
\begin{verbatim}
      % alink task.f `gns_link_adam`
\end{verbatim}
(note the use of the backward quotes)

To compile and link a standalone application called `prog.f' the following
is used
\begin{verbatim}
      % f77 prog.f -o prog `gns_link`
\end{verbatim}

\section{Programmer Interface}\label{prog}

When the first GNS routine is called, the GNS database files are opened. It is
therefore not necessary to call 
\htmlref{GNS\_START}{GNS_START} unless you want to verify that
the database can be opened before it is accessed. 
\htmlref{GNS\_STOP}{GNS_STOP} will close
the database but can be omitted in stand alone programs where image exit will
close the database.

Most character output arguments are accompanied by an integer length argument;
when the requested information is not available, the length argument is
returned as zero. This length must therefore always be checked before being
used to access a sub-string of the character argument. The symbolic constants
representing the maximum lengths of the various character arguments are defined 
in a FORTRAN include file that can be referenced by the name {\tt
GNS\_PAR}.

All routines that are specific to GKS have names ending in the letter ``G'' and
routines specific to IDI have names ending in the letter ``I''.
