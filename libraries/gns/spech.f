      SUBROUTINE GNS_1SPECH ( SPECH, REPCH, INSTR, THERE )

*+
*  Name:
*     GNS_1SPECH

*  Purpose:
*     Locate a special character in a string

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GNS_1SPECH( SPECH, REPCH, INSTR, THERE )

*  Description:
*     Locate the first occurence of a special character in the input
*     string and replace it with the replacement character. Return a
*     logical argument indicating if the special character was present
*     in the string or not.

*  Arguments:
*     SPECH = CHARACTER (Given)
*        Special character.
*     REPCH = CHARACTER (Given)
*        Replacement character.
*     INSTR = CHARACTER*(*) (Given and Returned)
*        Input string.
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if special character was in input string,
*        otherwise false.
