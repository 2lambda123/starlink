      LOGICAL FUNCTION gns_FILTG(ITYPE)
*+
*  Name:
*     GNS_FILTG

*  Purpose:
*     Filter list of available workstations

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     Filters the list of available workstations rejecting those which are
*     not supported by GKS (unless GKS is closed in which case all
*     workstations are passed).

*  Arguments:
*     ITYPE = INTEGER (Given)
*         Workstation type

*  Returned Value:
*     gns_FILTG = LOGICAL (Returned)
*         Include in list
