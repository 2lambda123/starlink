      SUBROUTINE GNS_TNDG ( NAME, DEVICE, IWKTYP, ICONID, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     GNS_TNDG

*  Purpose:
*     Translate name and device to GKS specification

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GNS_TNDG( NAME, DEVICE, IWKTYP, ICONID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The workstation name and physical device specification are
*     translated to a GKS workstation type and connection identifier
*     and, if necessary, a logical name created to map the connection
*     identifier onto the specified physical device or file.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Workstation name
*     DEVICE = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Physical device name
*     IWKTYP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        GKS workstation type
*     ICONID = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Connection identifier
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status

*  Side Effects:
*     A hard link to the file fort.n may be created.
*
*     The GNS database may be opened.
*
*     A GWM window with an overlay may be created.

*  Deficiencies:
*     If the device is identical ( workstation type and device name )
*     to a previous one then the same connection identifier is recovered
*     from the common block arrays. This, however, assumes that the
*     connection id. hasn't been hijacked in some way in between calls.

*     18-APR-1990 (DLT):
*        Original version.
*     12-DEC-1991 (NE):
*        Set environment variable GKS_xxxx for xwindows
*     24-FEB-1992  Correct setting of GKS_xxxx for xwindows:
*                  check workstation type not name.
*     16-MAR-1992 (NE):
*        Recover connection id from common block arrays
*     31-JUL-1992 (NE):
*        Check name for GKS_ before logical translation
*     21-AUG-1992 (NE):
*        Create X-window with overlay if '+' in name
*      1-SEP-1992 (NE):
*        Updated prologue.
*     14-JUL-1995 (DLT):
*        Don't create recursive GKS_xxxx_xxxx environment variables.
