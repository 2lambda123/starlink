      SUBROUTINE gns_1DECSP (SPEC,NAME,LNAME,PDEV,LPDEV)
*+
*  Name:
*     gns_1DECSP

*  Purpose:
*     Decompose a device specification into a device name and

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     a device type.
*     A device specification consists of a device name optionally
*     followed by a physical device name separated by a semi-colon.
*     Any leading or trailing spaces are removed from the strings.
*     If a component does not exist then a length of zero is returned as
*     the length and the string set to all blanks.

*  Arguments:
*     SPEC = CHAR (Given)
*         Device specification
*     NAME = CHAR (Returned)
*         Name
*     LNAME = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Length of name
*     PDEV = CHAR (Returned)
*         Physical device name
*     LPDEV = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Length of physical device
