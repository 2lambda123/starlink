      SUBROUTINE GNS_IWSG ( IWKID, WSSCA, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     GNS_IWSG

*  Purpose:
*     Inquire workstation scale

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GNS_IWSG( IWKID, WSSCA, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The size in metres of 'device units' for the specified GKS
*     workstation is returned.
*
*     Note that device units as defined by GKS are not necessarily the
*     same as the device resolution. On devices with a well defined actual
*     size such as plotters and printers device units are metres and a
*     value of 1.0 will be returned.

*  Arguments:
*     IWKID = INTEGER (Given)
*        GKS workstation identifier
*     WSSCA = REAL (Returned)
*        Size in metres of device units
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
