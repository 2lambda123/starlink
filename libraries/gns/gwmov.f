      SUBROUTINE GNS_1GWMOV ( WNAME, NAMLEN, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     GNS_1GWMOV

*  Purpose:
*     Open a GWM window with an overlay plane

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GNS_1GWMOV( WNAME, NAMLEN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Open a GWM window with an overlay plane. If a GWM window of the
*     given name does not exist then a new window is created with this
*     name with an overlay plane. The other window characteristics are
*     taken as the defualt.

*  Arguments:
*     WNAME = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Window name.
*     NAMLEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Length of window name string.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
