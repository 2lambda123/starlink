  <description>Graphics Workstation Name Service</description>
  <abstract><p> Almost any program that does any graphics requires the
  user to identify which graphics device is to be used. When the
  graphics package used by the program is GKS (SUN/83)---and for the
  majority of Starlink software it is, at least indirectly---graphics
  devices are identified by two integers, a `workstation type' and a
  `connection identifier'. (`Workstation' is GKS terminology for a
  graphics device of any description and this is the sense in which it
  is used throughout this note.) No one can be expected to remember
  the workstation types of all the devices supported by Starlink
  (nearly 50 at present) so a library has been provided that
  translates `friendly' and easy to remember names into their GKS
  equivalents.
