*  Purpose:
*     Trims leading and trailing blanks from a string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*     is all blanks the length is set to zero.

*  Arguments:
*     IN = CHAR (Given)
*         Input string
*     OUT = CHAR (Returned)
*         Output string
*     L = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Length of output string
