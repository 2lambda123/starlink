      SUBROUTINE GNS_IANG ( NAME, AGINAM, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     GNS_IANG

*  Purpose:
*     Inquire AGI name of GKS workstation

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GNS_IANG( NAME, AGINAM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The AGI name corresponding to the specified GKS workstation is
*     returned. If the name is longer then the supplied character
*     variable the name is truncated.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        GKS workstation name
*     AGINAM = CHARACTER*(GNS__SZAGI) (Returned)
*        AGI name
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status

*  Notes:
*     The AGI name is constructed from 'AGI_<wktype>_<seqno>' using the
*     GKS workstation type and a sequence number. The GKS workstation
*     type from the GKSNAMES file is used unless there is an AGITYPE
*     keyword for that device. A sequence number of zero is used unless
*     there is an explicit sequence number in the GKSNAMES file.
*
*     This routine is used by AGI and will not normally be called by an
*     applications program.
