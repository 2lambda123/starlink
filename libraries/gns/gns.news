This release of gns correct a bug which caused an infinite loop if an 
X-windows workstation was opened with a name of the form GKS_nn_mm.

The workstation names and description files are now located by searching
../etc relative to the directories on PATH.

The documentation has been updated to remove references to VMS and a
hypertext version created.

The test/demo program had been renamed gnsrun_gks and no longer tests IDI.
