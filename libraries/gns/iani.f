      SUBROUTINE GNS_IANI ( NAME, AGINAM, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     GNS_IANI

*  Purpose:
*     Inquire AGI name of IDI workstation

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GNS_IANI( NAME, AGINAM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The AGI name corresponding to the specified IDI workstation is
*     returned.
*
*     If the name is longer than the supplied character variable the
*     name is truncated.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        IDI workstation name
*     AGINAM = CHARACTER*(GNS__SZAGI) (Returned)
*        AGI name
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status

*  Notes:
*     The AGI name is constructed from 'AGI_<wktype>_<seqno>' using the
*     GKS workstation type and a sequence number. The GKS workstation
*     type is obtained from the AGITYPE attribute. A sequence number of
*     zero is used unless there is an explicit sequence number in the
*     IDINAMES file.
*
*     This routine is used by AGI and will not normally be called by an
*     applications program.
