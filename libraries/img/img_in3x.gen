      SUBROUTINE IMG_IN3<T>( PARAM, NX, NY, NZ, IP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IMG_IN3x

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains access to a 3-dimensional input image using a specific
*     type.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG_IN3x( PARAM, NX, NY, NZ, IP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine provides access to a 3-dimensional input image.  It
*     returns the size of the image and a pointer to its data, mapped
*     using the specified numeric type.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter name (case insensitive).
*     NX = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Size of the first dimension of the image (in pixels).
*     NY = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Size of the second dimension of the image (in pixels).
*     NZ = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Size of the third dimension of the image (in pixels).
*     IP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Pointer to the image data.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - There is a version of this routine for each numeric type,
*     obtained by replacing the "x" in the routine name by D, R, I, W,
*     UW, B or UB as appropriate.
*
*     - Access to multiple image data can also be provided by this
*     routine. Multiple parameter names are specified by supplying a
*     comma separated list of names (i.e. 'DATA1,DATA2,DATA3'). A
*     pointer to the data of each image is then returned (in this case
*     the IP argument should be passed as an array of size at least the
*     number of parameter names). The advantage of obtaining a sequence
*     of images in this manner is that the images are guaranteed to have
*     the same shape (NX, NY and NZ) and the same type.
