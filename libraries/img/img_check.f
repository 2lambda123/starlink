      SUBROUTINE IMG_CHECK( STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG_CHECK

*  Purpose:
*     Checks the current internal state of IMG.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG_CHECK( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine checks the IMG Parameter Control Block and reports
*     its contents. It is usual to call this routine in situations when
*     the current state of IMG is uncertain (i.e. during development).

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine executes even if STATUS is set on entry.
