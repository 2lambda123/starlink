      SUBROUTINE IMG1_EXEX( SLOT, ESLOT, ITEM, FOUND, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG1_EXEX

*  Purpose:
*    Checks for the existence of an extension item.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_EXEX( SLOT, ESLOT, ITEM, FOUND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine locates the HDS object ITEM in the extension (ESLOT)
*     of an NDF (SLOT). ITEM is the name of the object, which may be
*     hiearchical and refer to objects in structures and arrays,
*     provided the final object is a primitive.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number in the Parameter and Extension control blocks
*        of the NDF.
*     ESLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number of the extension.
*     ITEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the object which is to be located. This may be a
*        hierarchical list of objects. The final component must be a
*        primitive.
*     FOUND = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if the object is located.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

      CALL DAT_CLONE( ECB_XLOC( SLOT, ESLOT ), LOC1, STATUS )

*  The basic idea is to loop locating each period in the item name until
