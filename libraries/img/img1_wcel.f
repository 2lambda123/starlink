      SUBROUTINE IMG1_WCEL( SIZE, N, VALUE, ARRAY, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG1_WCEL

*  Purpose:
*     Writes to the nth element of a 1-d character array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_WCEL( SIZE, N, VALUE, ARRAY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine writes to the Nth element of the given character
*     array. It is most useful when dealing with mapped arrays,
*     otherwise direct assignment should be used.

*  Arguments:
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the array of characters.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the element to be written to.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The string to be copied into the character array at position N.
*     ARRAY( SIZE ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The array of character strings.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
