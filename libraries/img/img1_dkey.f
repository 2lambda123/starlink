      SUBROUTINE IMG1_DKEY( NCARD, BLOCK, KEYWRD, NOCCUR, DELETE,
     :                      STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG1_DKEY

*  Purpose:
*     Delete a FITS keyword, value and comment.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_DKEY( NCARD, BLOCK, KEYWRD, NOCCUR, DELETE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine locates a record which contains the NOCCUR'th
*     occurrence of the FITS keyword (in a "FITS block") and sets the
*     record to ' '. The keyword may be hierarchical.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements (cards) in BLOCK.
*     BLOCK( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The FITS block (note this is passed at this point so that it is
*        before the other *(*) characters which allows this array to be
*        mapped -- see SUN/92).
*     KEYWRD = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The FITS keyword. This may be hierarchical. The components of
*        the name should be separated by periods (e.g. ING.DETHEAD
*        results in a keyword 'ING DETHEAD').
*     NOCCUR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The occurence of the keyword to delete. Less than equal to one
*        means the first one.
*     DELETE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether or not the keyword was located and its record
*        "deleted".
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
