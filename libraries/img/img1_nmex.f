      SUBROUTINE IMG1_NMEX( SLOT, ESLOT, N, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG1_NMEX

*  Purpose:
*     Returns the number of extension items.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_NEX( SLOT, ESLOT, N, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the number of primitive objects in an
*     extension. It uses the values stored in the ECB common blocks to
*     determine this, so the extension must be traced (using IMG1_TRACE)
*     prior to calling this routine.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        NDF slot number.
*     ESLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Extension slot number.
*     N = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of items.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The N'th extension item is really the N'th primitive object,
*     this might not be what's required if only scalar primitives are
*     needed.
