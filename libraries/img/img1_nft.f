      SUBROUTINE IMG1_NFT( SLOT, N, ITEM, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG1_NFT

*  Purpose:
*     Returns the Nth record in a FITS block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_NFT( SLOT, N, ITEM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine access the FITS block associated with the NDF (SLOT)
*     and returns the value of the N'th record. Checking for string
*     truncation is performed.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number of the NDF.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the required record.
*     ITEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The value of the record (blank if not found).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*        Make sure that ITEM is blank if name is out of range (not an

*        Modified to use CNF_PVAL to deference C memory pointers.
