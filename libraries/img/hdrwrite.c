 * Name:
 *    HDRWRITE

 *  Purpose:
 *     Writes a new header item.

 *  Description:
 *     This routine is part of the IMG example suite. It accesses an
 *     existing image and creates a copy as an output image. It then
 *     writes a new header item to the output image.

 *  History:
 *     03-JUN-1998 (PWD):
 *         Original Version

 *  Notes:
 *     This could be simplified by just modifying the input image rather
 *     than creating a copy. To do this just comment out the imgIn and
 *     imgOut lines. You might also want to change the hdrOut line to
 *     access the image via parameter "in".
