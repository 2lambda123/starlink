      SUBROUTINE IMG_INDF( PARAM, INDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IMG_INDF

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains an NDF identifier for an image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG_INDF( PARAM, INDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine obtains an NDF identifier for an image. The
*     resulting identifier may be passed to routines from the NDF
*     library (see SUN/33) to perform lower-level operations on the
*     data which cannot be done using IMG routines.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter name (case insensitive).
*     INDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        NDF identifier for the image.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The NDF identifier returned by this routine should be annulled
*     (e.g. using NDF_ANNUL) when it is no longer required.  The IMG
*     system will not perform this operation itself.
*     -  If this routine is called with STATUS set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the INDF argument, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be
*     returned if the routine should fail for any reason.  The
*     NDF__NOID constant is defined in the NDF_PAR include file.
