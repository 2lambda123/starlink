      SUBROUTINE IMG1_CKEY( NCARD, BLOCK, N, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG1_CKEY

*  Purpose:
*     Counts the number of records in a FITS block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_CKEY( NCARD, BLOCK, N, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine counts the number of valid records in a FITS block.
*     The record organization of the FITS block is taken into account.
*     This is necessary when records may be blank and/or the position of
*     the 'END' keyword isn't known. Blank records are taken to indicate
*     that they have been deleted and should not be counted.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of real entries in FITS block (declared size).
*     BLOCK( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The FITS block.
*     N = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of valid records.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
