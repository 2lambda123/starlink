      SUBROUTINE IMG1_WRFT<T>( SLOT, ITEM, COMMEN, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG1_WRFTx

*  Purpose:
*    Writes the value of a FITS item.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_WRFTx( SLOT, ITEM, COMMEN, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine writes the value associated with a FITS keyword into
*     a FITS block. A FITS block must have been already associated with
*     the indicated NDF. If the keyword already exists in the FITS block
*     then it will be superceded (unless it is one of the specials
*     'COMMENT', 'HISTORY' or ' '), otherwise the new value will be
*     appended.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number of the NDF.
*     ITEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The FITS keyword. This may be heirarchical.
*     COMMEN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A comment to write with the value.
*     VALUE = <COMM> (Given)
*        The value to be associated with the keyword.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - this routine has a version for the types C, L, D, R and I.

*  Note the %VAL(80)'s following the last genuine arguments of certain
*  calls. This is the usual method used by compilers for passing the
*  lengths of strings on UNIX and needs to be used here since the
*  characters are mapped.
*
*  Before proceeding we need to find out if the keyword already exists,
*  if not then the memory allocated to the FITS block needs to be
*  extended to allow an extra record. Trap errors to do with format
*  conversion etc. from GKEY. THERE is still true if the keyword is
*  found in this state (we will overwrite regardless).
*
*  Avoid these checks if the keyword is one of the specials (COMMENT,
*  HISTORY or ' '). In this case a new card is always appended to any
*  existing ones (or more precisely just before the 'END' keyword).
