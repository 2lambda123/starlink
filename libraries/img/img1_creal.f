      SUBROUTINE IMG1_CREAL( SIZE, QUAN, POINT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IMG1_CALLO

*  Purpose:
*     Reallocate character virtual memory (UNIX version).

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_CREAL( SIZE, QUAN, POINT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine changes the size of a virtual memory character array
*     created by the routine IMG1_CALLO. The new size (dimension) of the
*     character array is QUAN. The original length of the elemental
*     strings should be given as SIZE, although this may also be
*     changed.
*
*     The contents of the strings are unchanged up to the memory address
*     which points to either the end of the adjusted array or the end of
*     the current array, whichever is the smaller. Note that if the
*     string size is changed then this will probably scramble any
*     information.

*  Arguments:
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the character strings which were/are to be
*        allocated (declared size of strings). This may be different to
*        the original string size.
*     QUAN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of character strings of SIZE which are to be
*        allocated (array dimension). This is the whole size of the
*        character array.
*     POINT = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The pointer to the original virtual memory on entry. Points to
*        the new memory on exit.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - UNIX specific. Does very little except call PSX routine.
*
*     - On UNIX systems the size of the character strings is passed
*     after the last real argument using the %VAL() mechanism, e.g.
*
*        call img1_creal( size, quan, ip, status )
*        call mysub( %val( ip ), quan, %val( size ) )
*        .
*        .
*        end
*
*        subroutine mysub( carray, size )
*
*        character * ( * ) carray( size )
*        .
*        .
*        end
