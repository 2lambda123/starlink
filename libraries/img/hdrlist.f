      SUBROUTINE HDRLIST( ISTAT )
*+
* Name:
*    HDRLIST

*  Purpose:
*     List all the header items in a named source.

*  Description:
*     This routine is part of the IMG example suite. It accesses an
*     existing image with a known header information source (such as
*     'FITS'). It then lists the names of all the items in the named
*     source and their values.

*         Original Version

*  Notes:
*     As this handles the special FITS header items 'COMMENT', 'HISTORY' 
*     and ' ', it is a little more complex than the documentation in
*     SUN/160 suggests.
*
*     The PAR routines are described in SUN/114.
