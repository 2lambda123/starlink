      SUBROUTINE IMG1_GKEYC( NCARD, BUFFER, SCARD, NAME, NOCCUR, THERE,
     :                       VALUE, CARD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IMG1_GKEYC

*  Purpose:
*     Get the value of a named header of type CHARACTER from a buffer of
*     FITS header card images.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_GKEYC( NCARD, BUFFER, SCARD, NAME, NOCCUR, THERE, VALUE,
*                      CARD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine searches a buffer containing the header card images
*     from a FITS file for a keyword NAME; and returns its value (as a
*     character string), and the number of the card image within the
*     buffer array that contains the named keyword.  The search ends
*     when the next end of a header block, marked by the END keyword,
*     is encountered or the buffer is exhausted.  If the keyword is
*     present THERE is true, otherwise it is false.  If the keyword is
*     expected to be present more than once then the argument NOCCUR
*     controls which occurrece will be retrieved. If a keyword is not
*     found then no error results and the argument VALUE remains
*     unmodified.
*
*     The name may be compound to permit reading of hierarchical
*     keywords.  This routine will also work for HISTORY, COMMENT and
*     the ' ' (blank) keyword.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of card images in the buffer.
*     BUFFER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * 80 (Given)
*        The buffer containing the header card images.
*     SCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from where the search will begin.  This
*        is needed because the headers may contain a dummy header
*        prior to an extension.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the keyword whose value is required.  This may be
*        a compound name to handle hierarchical keywords, and it has
*        the form keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  The maximum number of
*        keywords per FITS card is 20.  Comparisons are performed in
*        uppercase and blanks are removed.  Each keyword must be no
*        longer than 8 characters.
*     NOCCUR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value of this argument specifies which occurence of a
*        keyword should be used, if, multiple ones are expected. (Any
*        value less then equal to 1 indicates the first occurrence)
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true the keyword %NAME is present (regardless of exit
*        status).
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The value of the keyword.  The string is truncated to the
*        length of VALUE if the FITS value contains more characters than
*        tat.
*     CARD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the card containing the named keyword.  If the
*        card could not be found this is set to the position of the
*        last card or the 'END' card..
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  History:
*     1988 Sep 22 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1989 Jul 17 (MJC):
*        Removed the trailing quote if present.
*     1989 Jul 28 (MJC):
*        Added extra argument CARD.
*     1990 November 19 (MJC):
*        Renamed from FITSGC, and converted the prologue to the SST
*        style.
*     1991 February 28 (MJC):
*        Converted BUFFER from an assumed-size to an adjustable array
*        via the NCARD argument in case the END keyword is missing.
*     1991 July 14 (MJC):
*        Modified to handle hierarchical keywords.
*     1991 August 31 (MJC):
*        Fixed bug in comparing card keyword with the selected keyword.
*     1992 June 24 (MJC):
*        Made to handle a value without a trailing blank.  Takes the
*        remainder of the card image as the value.
*     21-JUL-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Incorporated into IMG_ (was called FTS1_GKEYC in KAPPA).
*     21-JUL-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Rewrite to remove need for quoted strings so HISTORY and
*        COMMENT strings are allowed (these do not necessarily have the
*        form "keyword = ' value  '/ comment", "keyword 'value'" is more
*        likely).
*     21-JUL-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Re-created flexible formatting after SCCS crisis.
*     12-SEP-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Added ability to read occurence for multiple FITS keywords.
