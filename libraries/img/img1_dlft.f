      SUBROUTINE IMG1_DLFT( SLOT, ITEM, NOCCUR, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG1_DLFTx

*  Purpose:
*    Deletes a FITS record.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_DLFTx( SLOT, ITEM, NOCCUR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine deletes a record in a FITS block which contains the
*     NOCCUR'th occurence of the given FITS keyword. A FITS block must
*     have been already associated with the indicated NDF. If the
*     keyword does not exist then no error is reported.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number of the NDF.
*     ITEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The FITS keyword. This may be heirarchical.
*     NOCCUR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The occurence of the FITS keyword which is to be deleted.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*     12-SEP-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Now doesn't worry about missing items and deals with multiple

*     20-APR-1999 (PDRAPER):
*        Modified to use CNF_PVAL to deference C memory pointers.
