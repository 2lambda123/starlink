      SUBROUTINE IMG1_NEX( SLOT, ESLOT, N, ITEM, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG1_NEX

*  Purpose:
*     Returns the name of the "Nth" extension item.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_NEX( SLOT, ESLOT, N, ITEM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the Nth primitive object from an extension.
*     The extension is represented by a stack of all the locators to the
*     primitives within the extension. This routine merely indexes this
*     stack and uses the locator to derive the name.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        NDF slot number.
*     ESLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Extension slot number.
*     N = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The index of the required item.
*     ITEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The full name of the extension primitive.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The N'th extension item is really the N'th primitive object,
*     this might not be what's required if only scalar primitives are
*     needed.

*  History:
*     28-JUL-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     10-AUG-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Added ability to count the number of primitives if N is -1.
*     2-SEP-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Complete re-write to use a more efficient method for indexing
*        the primitives in an extension. Previous versions walked the
*        extension tree for every inquiry.
*     20-APR-1999 (PDRAPER):
*        Modified to use CNF_PVAL to deference C memory pointers.
