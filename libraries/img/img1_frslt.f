      SUBROUTINE IMG1_FRSLT( SLOT, KEEP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IMG1_FRSLT

*  Purpose:
*     Free the resources associated with a parameter slot.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_FRSLT( SLOT, KEEP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine frees all the NDF_ and IMG_ system resources
*     associated with a specified parameter slot and then frees the
*     slot itself. This makes the associated data inaccessible. Any NDF
*     associated with the slot may be kept or deleted, as required. Any
*     existing parameter association remains and can be re-used if
*     necessary.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        PCB slot number to be freed.
*     KEEP = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether any associated NDF is to be kept (as opposed to being
*        deleted). This does not apply to temporary NDFs, which are
*        always deleted.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine attempts to execute even if STATUS is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.

*  History:
*     25-JAN-1991 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     18-FEB-1992 (RFWS):
*        Renamed and added handling of temporary NDFs and bad pixel
*        flags.
*     2-MAR-1993 (RFWS):
*        Added the KEEP argument.
*     13-JUL-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Now checks that NDFs may be deleted before making the attempt.
*        An error is issued if the NDF may not be deleted.
