 * Name:
 *    HDRLIST
 
 *  Purpose:
 *     List all the header items in a named source.
 
 *  Description:
 *     This routine is part of the IMG example suite. It accesses an
 *     existing image with a known header information source (such as
 *     "FITS"). It then lists the names of all the items in the named
 *     source and their values.

 *  History:
 *     03-JUN-1998 (PWD):
 *         Original Version

 *  Notes:
 *     As this handles the special FITS header items "COMMENT", "HISTORY" 
 *     and " ", it is a little more complex than the documentation in
 *     SUN/160 suggests.
