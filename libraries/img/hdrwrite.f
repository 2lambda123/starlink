*         Original Version

*  Notes:
*     This could be simplified by just modifying the input image rather
*     than creating a copy. To do this just comment out the IMG_IN and
*     IMG_OUT lines. You might also want to change the HDR_OUT line to
*     access the image via parameter 'IN'.
*
*     The PAR routines are described in SUN/114.
