      SUBROUTINE IMG1_REPFT( SLOT1, SLOT2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IMG1_REPFT

*  Purpose:
*     Replicates a FITS extension by making a complete copy to a new slot.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_REPFT( SLOT1, SLOT2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine makes a complete copy of an existing FITS block,
*     adding the new copy to the another slot (thereby copying a FITS
*     header source from one NDF to another, although the actual copy is
*     done when the NDF is released). The target extension slot must
*     allow write access to the image. This is not checked here.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT1 = INTEGER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Slot number of the image containing FITS block.
*     SLOT2 = INTEGER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Slot number of the image to get copy of FITS block.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*        ECB_XNAME( IMG__MXPAR, IMG__MXEXT ) =
*           CHARACTER * ( NDF__SZXNM ) (Read)

*        ECB_XLOC( IMG__MXPAR, IMG__MXEXT ) =

*        ECB_FTSN( IMG__MXPAR ) = INTEGER (Read and Write)
*        Number of entries in the FITS block.

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER SLOT1
      INTEGER SLOT2
      
*  Status:
      INTEGER STATUS            ! Global status

*  Local Variables:
      INTEGER NOUT              ! Number of copied FITS records
 
*.

*  Check inherited global status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  This is a very simple process. Just update the ECB to contain a copy
*  of the new FITS block (freeing the existing memory first). This will
*  be copied into the image when the IMG1_FREXT is called.
