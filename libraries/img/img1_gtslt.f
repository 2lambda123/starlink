      SUBROUTINE IMG1_GTSLT( VPAR, NEW, SLOT, WASNEW, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IMG1_GTSLT

*  Purpose:
*     Get a slot number for a validated parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_GTSLT( VPAR, NEW, SLOT, WASNEW, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches the PCB to identify a slot which refers to
*     the specified parameter, whose name has previously been
*     validated. If no such slot is found, then a new one will be
*     initialised if NEW is .TRUE., otherwise STATUS will be set and an
*     an appropriate error will be reported.

*  Arguments:
*     VPAR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Validated parameter name (left justified, in upper case).
*     NEW = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If a slot already allocated to the parameter cannot be found,
*        then the routine will allocate a new one if NEW is .TRUE..
*        Otherwise, an error will be reported.
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of the PCB slot associated with the parameter. A value
*        of zero will be returned if the parameter entry cannot be
*        found in the parameter control block and no new slot was
*        allocated.
*     WASNEW = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Returns .TRUE. if a new slot was allocated for the parameter,
*        otherwise it returns .FALSE..
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
