      SUBROUTINE IMG1_FREXT( SLOT, ESLOT, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    IMG1_FREXT

*  Purpose:
*     Frees the resources associated with an NDF extension.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG1_FREXT( SLOT, ESLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine frees up any resources associated with an extension.
*     The NDF is identified by its slot number and the extension by its
*     index. The resources associated with an extension are a record of
*     its name and a locator to it. An extension may also have a
*     pointer to a FITS block or a pointer to a stack locators which
*     trace HDS primitives in the extension. FITS blocks will be
*     memory resident so need to be copied back into the data file.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number of the NDF.
*     ESLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the extension.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - This routine attempts to execute even if status is bad on entry.

*  History:
*     19-JUL-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     8-SEP-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Added code to clean up extension traces.
*     20-SEP-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Removed PSX calls.
*     15-NOV-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        No readonly access now allowed. FITS blocks are always memory
*        copies.
*     28-NOV-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Back-tracked to allow some readonly access for input NDFs. This
*        is determined by file protections.
*     16-DEC-1996 (PDRAPER):
*        Moved modification of extension size into modified block. 
*        Uninitialized variables were breaking this code on Linux.
*     20-APR-1999 (PDRAPER):
*        Modified to use CNF_PVAL to deference C memory pointers.
