      SUBROUTINE IMG_NEW( PARAM, NX, NY, IP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IMG_NEW

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a new image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMG_NEW( PARAM, NX, NY, IP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates a new 2-dimensional image and returns a
*     pointer to its data, mapped as floating point (REAL) values.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter name (case insensitive).
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension size of the image (in pixels).
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second dimension size of the image (in pixels).
*     IP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Pointer to the image data.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - This routine may create more than one new image at a time by
*     using multiple parameter names. Multiple names are specified by
*     supplying a comma separated list (i.e. 'NEW1,NEW2'). A pointer to
*     the data of each image is then returned (in this case the IP
*     argument must be passed as an array of size at least the number
*     of parameter names). An advantage of this method is that multiple
*     images can be made using a single invocation of this routine.
