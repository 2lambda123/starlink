      INTEGER FUNCTION SHL_GTHLPI( STRING, PROMPT, LINCH )
*+
*  Name:
*     SHL_GTHLPI

*  Purpose:
*     Gets one line input during an help session.

*  Language:
*     Vax Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     Called as sixth argument of LBR$OUTPUT_HELP or seventh of
*     HLP_OUTHLP.

*  Description:
*     Analogue of VAX/VMS RTL routine LIB$GET_INPUT.  During a
*     HELP session, gets one line of input. VAX DEPENDENT!
*     However, the Vax extensions used are available on SUN and
*     DECstation compilers.  Note, inherited status is not used.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The line of text to be output to the screen.
*     PROMPT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*         Prompt string.
*     LINCH = INTEGER (Read)
*         Length of the input string in characters.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     SHL_GTHLPI = INTEGER
*        The status.  If the line was inpput correctly a value of 1 is
*        returned.
