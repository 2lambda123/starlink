  <description>SHL -- Support for HLP Library access</description>
  <abstract><p>The Starlink HLP system allows an application program
      to retrieve named items from a hierarchically-arranged library
      of text.  The facility resembles VAX/VMS HELP.  It consists of a
      library plus utility programs for creating, listing and reading
      help libraries.</p>
     <p>Since each application needs its own help system, it made little
     sense to rewrite a help browser for each application independently.
     Over the years Starlink applications have switched to using the
     standard KAPPA help application code. Implemented by copying
     the kappa files to each application in turn. Now that all the
     applications are in a single location, the kappa help infrastructure
     has been factored out into the SHL library.</p>
     <p>In addition to the KAPPA fortran infrastructure, a C implementation
     of a help browser has also been integrated (from figaro) into
     SHL.</p>
