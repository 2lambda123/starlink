 * Name:
 *    shl_standalone

 * Purpose:
 *    Browse through a Starlink help library.

 * Language:
 *    Starlink ANSI C

 * Type of Module:
 *    Library function

 * Invocation:
 *    status = shl_standalone( helplb, isenv, argc, argv );
 
 * Arguments:
 *    helplb = char * (Given)
 *       Name of default help library to open. There must be a corresponding
 *       environment variable named HELPLB_HELP containing the help
 *       file to be opened. Will be ignored if argv contains a -l parameter.
 *       Can be a NULL pointer only if -l is guaranteed. _HELP is added
 *       to the parameter automatically if not present. ".shl" is added
 *       if not present.
 *    isenv = int (Given)
 *       If 1, indicates that helplb refers to a environment variable.
 *       If 0, indicates that it refers to a file. Ignored if -l
 *       option is present in argv or if helplb is NULL
 *    argc = int (Given)
 *       The number of elements in argv.
 *    argv = char ** (Given)
 *       Array of strings, ostensibly read from the command line.

 * Return value:
 *    status = int
 *       Contains EXIT_SUCCESS on success and EXIT_FAILURE on failure.
 *       These can be passed directly to main(). They are defined
 *       in stdlib.h

 * Usage:
 *    helpc [-l library.shl] [topic [subtopic [subsubtopic ...]]]

 * Description:
 *    The following description assumes this library function is
 *    called as described below by a thin calling routine from main.
 *    The application itself has been factored into a subroutine to simplify
 *    code re-use. Whenever "application" is used it refers to this 
 *    library function. The usage described above is assumed since this
 *    module process the command line arguments.
 *
 *    The subroutine is designed to be called with argv and returned
 *    directly to the main routine.
 *
 *    This application is an interactive browser to display the contents of a
 *    Starlink help library on an alphanumeric terminal. The user can navigate
 *    through the library with the following responses to the prompt:
 *
 *    -  A blank response gets you one level up in the topic hierarchy.
 *    -  A question mark (?) re-displays the current topic.
 *    -  An end-of-file character exits. This is usually Ctrl-d.
 *    -  Any normal text specifies (sub-) topics to look for.
 *    -  Each blank-separated word stands for one topic in the
 *       hierarchy. E.g. three blank-separated words go down three
 *       levels in the hierarchy.
 *    -  Each underscore-separated word stands for an underscore-separated
 *       word in a single topic.
 *    -  Words (whether separated by blanks or underscores) that are not
 *       unique topics or include wild card characters are expanded and
 *       help is given on all matching topics. Wild card characters are
 *       % for a single character and * for any number of characters
 *       including none. In the word expansion A_G_N would match
 *       active_galactic_nuclei, which is one topic. The same is true
 *       for A*_G*_N* or active or active*.
 *
 *    When the help text to be printed is longer than the terminal page,
 *    then the user is asked to press the Return key before proceeding
 *    with output. At this point, too, can an end-of-file character be
 *    given to exit immediately.

 * Parameters:
 *    -l:
 *       Next parameter is the name of the Starlink help library to be opened.
 *       If given, this parameter must be the first, the library name the
 *       second.
 *    library.shl:
 *       The name of the Starlink help library. These names usually end in
 *       ".shl". If given, "-l" must be the first and this the second
 *       parameter. ".shl" is added if none is present.
 *    topic, subtopic etc.:
 *       The initial entry point in the hierarchy of topics and subtopics in
 *       the help library.

 * Notes:
 *    Although this library routine behaves as a full C main application
 *    routine, the main has to be provided by the programmer. It should
 *    look something like this:
 *
 *    #include "shl.h"
 *    void main( int argc, char **argv )
 *    { 
 *       (void) shl_standalone( "KAPPA", 1, argc, argv );
 *    }
 *
 *    Where the first argument is the name of the application help
 *    system that is to be accessed. The assumption is that there is
 *    an environment variable named, in this case, KAPPA_HELP that
 *    contains the location of a help file.
 *
 *    The main routine can be compiled as normal but need to be linked
 *    against the shl library and the Fortran runtime libraries. Outside
 *    of autoconf, the easiest way to do this is to compile the
 *    main routine without linking, and then link using the fortran compiler:
 *
 *    cc  -I/star/include -c helpm.c
 *    f77 -o helpc helpm.o `shl_link`
 *
 *    gcc or cc cannot be used as linker, since they do not link with the
 *    Fortran libraries that FIO and HLP require. f77 seems to link C code only
 *    if the main routine is compiled by cc, not if it is compiled by gcc.
 *    Note that if you use autoconf make sure you use @FCLIBS@ and the
 *    STAR_FC_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS macro.

 * History:
 *    28 Mar 1994 (hme):
 *       Original version.
 *    10 Feb 1998 (ajc):
 *       Mod to use termios
 *    24 Jul 2004 (timj):
 *       Incorporate into SHL library. Now standalone.
 *       Uses one_scrsz. Allows for envvar to have optional _HELP
 *       in supplied value, and optional .shl
 *    28 Jul 2004 (timj):
 *       Add isenv. Now call fortran SHL code rather than duplicate loads
 *       of that code in C. Now have return status.
 *    01 Nov 2006 (TIMJ):
 *       Use C interface to Fortran routines.
