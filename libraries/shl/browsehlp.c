 *  Name:
 *    browsehlp
 *
 *  Purpose:
 *    Generic help browser
 *
 *  Language:
 *    Starlink ANSI C
 *

 * Usage:
 *    helpc [-l library.shl] [topic [subtopic [subsubtopic ...]]]

 * Description:
 *    The following description assumes this library function is
 *    called as described below by a thin calling routine from main.
 *    The application itself has been factored into a subroutine to simplify
 *    code re-use. Whenever "application" is used it refers to this
 *    library function. The usage described above is assumed since this
 *    module process the command line arguments.
 *
 *    The subroutine is designed to be called with argv and returned
 *    directly to the main routine.
 *
 *    This application is an interactive browser to display the contents of a
 *    Starlink help library on an alphanumeric terminal. The user can navigate
 *    through the library with the following responses to the prompt:
 *
 *    -  A blank response gets you one level up in the topic hierarchy.
 *    -  A question mark (?) re-displays the current topic.
 *    -  An end-of-file character exits. This is usually Ctrl-d.
 *    -  Any normal text specifies (sub-) topics to look for.
 *    -  Each blank-separated word stands for one topic in the
 *       hierarchy. E.g. three blank-separated words go down three
 *       levels in the hierarchy.
 *    -  Each underscore-separated word stands for an underscore-separated
 *       word in a single topic.
 *    -  Words (whether separated by blanks or underscores) that are not
 *       unique topics or include wild card characters are expanded and
 *       help is given on all matching topics. Wild card characters are
 *       % for a single character and * for any number of characters
 *       including none. In the word expansion A_G_N would match
 *       active_galactic_nuclei, which is one topic. The same is true
 *       for A*_G*_N* or active or active*.
 *
 *    When the help text to be printed is longer than the terminal page,
 *    then the user is asked to press the Return key before proceeding
 *    with output. At this point, too, can an end-of-file character be
 *    given to exit immediately.

 * Parameters:
 *    -l:
 *       Next parameter is the name of the Starlink help library to be opened.
 *       If given, this parameter must be the first, the library name the
 *       second.
 *    library.shl:
 *       The name of the Starlink help library. These names usually end in
 *       ".shl". If given, "-l" must be the first and this the second
 *       parameter. ".shl" is added if none is present.
 *    topic, subtopic etc.:
 *       The initial entry point in the hierarchy of topics and subtopics in
 *       the help library.
