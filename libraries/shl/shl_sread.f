*+ SHL_SREAD - Read, condition, paraphrase and classify a string.

      SUBROUTINE SHL_SREAD (LU, V1, V2, V3, JSTAT)
*+
*  Name:
*     SHL_SREAD

*  Purpose:
*     Read, condition, paraphrase and classify a string

*  Description:
*     A string is input from the nominated I/O unit LU (in A format)
*     and, unless end-of-file was detected, three versions of it are
*     created.
*
*     Version 1 (V1) is as input except that spaces replace any
*     non-printing characters (e.g. TABs).
*
*     Version 2 (V2) is the same as version 1 except that any leading
*     spaces or trailing comments are removed.
*
*     Version 3 (V3) is the same as version 2 except that outside
*     "string arguments", lowercase is converted to uppercase.

*  Arguments:
*     LU = _INTEGER (Given)
*        I/O unit for input
*     V1 = _CHAR (Returned)
*        String with TABS etc eliminated
*     V2 = _CHAR (Returned)
*        String left justified and without comments
*     JSTAT = _INTEGER (Returned)
*        Status:  -1 = end-of-file
*                  0 = not a comment
*                 +1 = comment

*  Notes:
*    o  "String arguments" are groups of characters enclosed by
*       pairs of either single or double quotes.  The contents
*       are protected against conversion to uppercase.  The delimiters
*       are ultimately removed by means of the GETSTR routine.
*    o  A '!' character is only interpreted as start of comment
*       if it is not within a string argument.
*    o  If end-of-file is detected, spaces are returned for V1,
*       V2 and V3.
*    o  The algorithm uses several characters which are outside
*       the ANSI FORTRAN 77 set (exclamation point, double quote,
*       tilde, lowercase).  Different machine types may need a
*       rewrite.
*    o  This subprogram was suggested by the RDNEXT routine of
*       Russell Owen (UW/ARC).
