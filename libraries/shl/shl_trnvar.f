      SUBROUTINE SHL_TRNVAR( LIBNAM, ISENV, LIBRAY, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SHL_ADAM

*  Purpose:
*     Gives help about specified application

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SHL_TRNVAR( LIBNAM, ISENV, LIBRAY, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     LIBNAM = CHARACTER (Given)
*        Name of environment variable to use to obtain the location
*        of the required help library. _HELP is appended to the library
*        name, if not present, before translating environment variable.
*        Must translate to an actual help library file (the .shl
*        extension is optional).
*     ISENV = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Indicates whether LIBNAM refers to an environment variable
*        that must be translated to obtain the actual name of the
*        help file (.TRUE.) or an actual help file with path. (.FALSE.)
*     LIBRAY = CHARACTER (Returned)
*        Name of the translated file name, including the .shl. Must
*        be large enough to receive the string. Bad status is set
*        if the string is truncated.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Translates the supplied argument to a help library file.
*     If ISENV is true, the argument can either be the name of an
*     environment variable that translates to a help file, or the
*     root of an environment variable requiring a _HELP suffix.

*     IF ISENV is false, it is assumed to be the name of the help
*     file with or without the .shl extension.

*     Either way, a .shl is added to the help file name if none is present.

*  Now we need to form the library name by making sure there is a .shl
