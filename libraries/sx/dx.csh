#  Name:
#     dx.csh

#  Purpose:
#     Start up the IBM Data Explorer (DX) incorporating the extensions in
#     the Starlink "SX" package.

#  Type of Module:
#     C shell script.

#  Invocation:
#     tcsh -c "source dx.csh" <options>

#  Description:
#     This procedure puts SX_DIR on the PATH if it is not already there.
#     It then runs dx in editor mode, with command line options to include 
#     the modules and macros in SX_DIR. Any dx command line options
#     supplied as arguments to this script are appended to the end of the
#     command. 
#
#     If the first option is "demo" then a DX/SX demo network is run. The
#     name of the demo should be given as the second option. If this is
#     not done, the user is prompted for the demo name.
#
#     By default, this script attempts to allocate three quarters of the 
#     currently un-used swap space to DX.
