Version 1.8
-----------
MSG1_GREF is completely revised to simplify its interface with the parameter
system, using a new routine SUBPAR_GREF. This allows the underlying parameter
system to be replaced more easily. Suboutine MSG1_GLOC is now not requited and
has been removed. This Version of MERS requires PCS Version 4.1 or later.

Version 1.7-1.
--------------
Corrects a problem using the reserved token ^STATUS if another token precedes
it in the message, and includes a minor update to SUN/104.

MERS Version 1.7 is released.
-----------------------------
This version has been substantially revised internally to use version 2.0 of
EMS, which is implemented in C.

MERS now uses only the public interface to EMS (formerly a number of internal
EMS routines were called).

Because the lowest level is now in C, output of error message at the base
error reporting level is now done by C printf commands. On some systems this
can lead to incorrect sequencing of messages if other output is done by
Fortran WRITE.

A bug which caused the linker to report subroutine MSG_IFSET missing if
MSG_IFGET was called, has been corrected.
