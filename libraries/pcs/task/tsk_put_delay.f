      SUBROUTINE TASK_PUT_DELAY ( DELAY, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TASK_PUT_DELAY

*  Purpose:
*     Set delay before next entry for current action

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TASK_PUT_DELAY ( DELAY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Sets the delay in milliseconds before the next entry for the current
*     action. This simply involves copying to COMMON.

*  Arguments:
*     DELAY=INTEGER (given)
*           The delay before the next action entry in milliseconds. Depending
*           on the status returned from ACT, this may act as as a time-out
*           period. -1 means infinity.
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Copy information to COMMON.
