      SUBROUTINE TASK_ASTSIGNAL ( NAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TASK_ASTSIGNAL

*  Purpose:
*     Signal an AST event to main-line code

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TASK_ASTSIGNAL ( NAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine should be called inside a user AST routine invoked
*     initially by a d-task action, on completion of the AST routine.
*     It signals to the d-task system that completion has occurred and
*     the required action can now enter the next stage.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER (import)
*           name of action to be staged

*  Algorithm:
*     Disable further AST events. 
*     Signal the MESSYS that an AST interrupt has occurred.
