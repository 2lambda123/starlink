      SUBROUTINE TASK_ASTMSG ( NAME, LENGTH, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TASK_ASTMSG

*  Purpose:
*     Used in user AST routine to signal to dtask

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TASK_ASTMSG ( NAME, LENGTH, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine should be called inside a user AST routine invoked
*     initially by a d-task action, on completion of the AST routine.
*     It signals to the d-task system that completion has occurred and
*     the required action can now enter the next stage.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME=CHARACTER (given)
*           name of action to be staged
*     LENGTH=INTEGER (given)
*           number of significant bytes in VALUE
*     VALUE=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*           a set of bytes to be passed to the main-line code
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Signal the MESSYS that an AST interrupt has occurred.
