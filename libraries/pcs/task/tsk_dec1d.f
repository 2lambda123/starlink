      SUBROUTINE TASK_DEC1D ( STRING, MAXVALS, NVALS, DVALS,
     :                          STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TASK_DEC1D

*  Purpose:
*     Decode a character string as a vector

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TASK_DEC1D ( STRING, MAXVALS, NVALS, DVALS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Convert the given character string, which is assumed to have
*     the ADAM syntax for an array, that is the whole is surrounded by
*     [] and the elements of the array are separated, into a 1-D array.
*     There is a routine for each type C, D, I, L, R.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*           the given character string
*     MAXVALS=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*           the maximum number of values that can be returned
*     NVALS=INTEGER (returned)
*           number of values in the 1-D array
*     DVALS(NVALS)=DOUBLE PRECISION (returned)
*           the returned 1-D array
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Call TASK_DECND
