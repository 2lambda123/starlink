      SUBROUTINE TASK_ENCNL ( NDIMS, DIMS, LVALS, STRING, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TASK_ENCNL

*  Purpose:
*     Encode an array as a character string

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TASK_ENCNL ( NDIMS, DIMS, LVALS, STRING, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Convert the given multidimensional array into characters and
*     concatenate the values into a string with separators. The
*     dimensions of the array are delimited by [] following the ADAM
*     syntax.
*     There is a routine for each type C, D, I, L, R.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIMS=INTEGER (given)
*           number of dimensions of the given array
*     DIMS(NDIMS)=INTEGER (given)
*           the dimensions of the given array
*     LVALS(1:*)=LOGICAL (given)
*           the given array, treated as a vector
*     STRING=CHARACTER*(*) (returned)
*           the returned string
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Convert each of the given values into an element in a 1-D array of
*     strings. Then call the ADAM string building routine to concatenate
*     the strings into a single string with the correct syntax.
