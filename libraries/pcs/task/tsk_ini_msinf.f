      SUBROUTINE TASK_INIT_MESSINFO ( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TASK_INIT_MESSINFO

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise list of active subsidiary actions

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TASK_INIT_MESSINFO ( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Initialises the list of active subsidiary actions. This simply involves
*     clearing the action pointers to zero, since the first zero action
*     pointer indicates the entry past the last used one.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Clear all action pointers to zero.
