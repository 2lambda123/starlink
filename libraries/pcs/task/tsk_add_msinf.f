      SUBROUTINE TASK_ADD_MESSINFO ( PATH, MESSID, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TASK_ADD_MESSINFO

*  Purpose:
*     Add to list of active subsidiary actions for an action

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TASK_ADD_MESSINFO ( PATH, MESSID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Adds an entry to the list of active subsidiary actions for the current
*     action. The entry simply associates the action with the path and
*     message id corresponding to the action that it has just initiated
*     in a subsidiary task.

*  Arguments:
*     PATH=INTEGER (given)
*           The path identifying the subsidiary task
*     MESSID=INTEGER (given)
*           The message id identifying the action in the subsidiary task
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Check that there is a current action (action pointer should be in COMMON).
*     Search through the list until find a free entry (action pointer <= 0).
*     Copy current action pointer, path and message id to the entry.
