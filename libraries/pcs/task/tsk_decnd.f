      SUBROUTINE TASK_DECND ( STRING, NMAXDIMS, MAXDIMS, NDIMS, DIMS,

*+
*  Name:
*     TASK_DECND

*  Purpose:
*     Decode a character string as an array

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TASK_DECND ( STRING, NMAXDIMS, MAXDIMS, NDIMS, DIMS,
*                         DVALS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Convert the given character string, which is assumed to have
*     the ADAM syntax for an array, that is the whole is surrounded by
*     [] and the elements of the array are separated, into a 1-D array.
*     Future versions could support returning multi-dimensional arrays.
*     There is a routine for each type C, D, I, L, R.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*           the given character string
*     NMAXDIMS=INTEGER (given)
*           the maximum number of dimensions that can be returned
*     MAXDIMS(NMAXDIMS)=INTEGER (given)
*           the maximum array indices in the various dimensions that
*           can be returned
*     NDIMS=INTEGER (returned)
*           number of dimensions in the decoded array
*     DIMS(NDIMS)=INTEGER (returned)
*           sizes of dimensions of the decoded array
*     DVALS(1:*)=DOUBLE PRECISION (returned)
*           the decoded array, treated as a vector
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Call the ADAM string splitting routine to split the string into a
*     1-D array of strings. Then convert each of these strings into an
*     element of the returned array using the appropriate TASK_DEC0 routine.
