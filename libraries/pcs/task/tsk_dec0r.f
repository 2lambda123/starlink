      SUBROUTINE TASK_DEC0R ( STRING, RVAL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TASK_DEC0R

*  Purpose:
*     Decode a character string as a value

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TASK_DEC0R ( STRING, RVAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Convert the given character string into a value of type
*     REAL and return it in RVAL.
*     A routine exists for each type C, D, L, I, R.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*           the string to be decoded
*     RVAL=REAL (returned)
*           the returned value
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Use CHR_CTOR.
