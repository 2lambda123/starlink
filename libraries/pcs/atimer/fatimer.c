*  Name:
*     FATIMER

*  Purpose:
*     A Fortran callable interface to the ATIMER C routines

*  Language:
*     C

*  Description:
*     Provides a Fortran callable interface to ATIMER_SETTIMR
*     and ATIMER_CANTIM which set and cancel millisecond timers.
*     A C routine has to be written as the handler routine, specified
*     in the SSETTIMR call, which is called directly by the ATIMER system. 
*     The C handler may be written as follws to call a handler written
*     in Fortran:
*
*        #include "f77.h"
*
*        extern void F77_EXTERNAL_NAME(fhandlr)( INTEGER(id) );
*
*        F77_SUBROUTINE(chandlr)( int id )
*
*        F77_CALL(fhandlr)( INTEGER_ARG(&id) );

*  Purpose:
*     A Fortran callable interface to the ATIMER_CANTIM C routine

*  Language:
*     C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FATIMER_CANTIM( ID, STATUS )
