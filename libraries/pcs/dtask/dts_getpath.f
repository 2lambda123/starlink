      SUBROUTINE DTASK_GETPATH ( NAME, PATH, MESSID, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DTASK_GETPATH

*  Purpose:
*     Get path to task which initiated named action

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DTASK_GETPATH ( NAME, PATH, MESSID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Obtains the ADAM message path to the task which started the
*     action named along with the associated message number.  The action
*     must be currently active.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*           action name
*     PATH=INTEGER (returned)
*           path pointer back to controlling task
*     MESSID=INTEGER (given)
*           message number of the OBEY message
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Calls dtask_srchlst to obtain pointer to the action in the action
*     list;  then looks up the appropriate path pointer and messid.
