      SUBROUTINE DTASK_ASTHDLR ( ASTPARM )
*+
*  Name:
*     DTASK_ASTHDLR

*  Purpose:
*     AST handler for timed reschedules

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     Invoked by timer completion
*     interrupts.

*  Description:
*     Signals that a timer has completed indicating that an action is
*     due for rescheduling.

*  Arguments:
*     ASTPARM=INTEGER (given)
*           packed action number plus action counter passed by value

*  Algorithm:
*     Interpret the AST parameter. This has been passed by VALUE, which
*     is necessary to ensure it is unique to this timer event. The
*     parameter contains two two-byte integers.
