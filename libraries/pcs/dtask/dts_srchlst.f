      SUBROUTINE DTASK_SRCHLST ( NAME, ACTPTR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DTASK_SRCHLST

*  Purpose:
*     Search action list for named action

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DTASK_SRCHLST ( NAME, ACTPTR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Searches action list for named ACTIVE action.  If found,
*     returns pointer and sets status DTASK__ACTACTIVE. If not found or 
*     action not active, returns ACTPTR=0 status DTASK__NOTFOUND.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*           action name
*     ACTPTR=INTEGER (returned)
*           pointer to this entry in the action list
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Do a sequential search through the names in the common block.
*     NACTS is the number of actions currently in the list.
