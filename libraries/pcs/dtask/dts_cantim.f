      SUBROUTINE DTASK_CANTIM ( ACTPTR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DTASK_CANTIM

*  Purpose:
*     Unix version: cancel the timer for an action

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DTASK_CANTIM ( ACTPTR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Cancel the timer for the specified action if there is one.

*  Arguments:
*     ACTPTR=INTEGER (given)
*           index to DTASK common blocks for the action
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Look-up the timer id for this action. If it is non-zero it has
*     been used to declare a timer, so cancel the timer (even though it
*     may have gone off), set the timer id to zero and increment the
*     action counter so that the next timer id generated will be
*     different.

*      A timer has been declared for this action. It may already have gone off.
*      This is ignored on VMS but the Unix cancel timer routine can return
