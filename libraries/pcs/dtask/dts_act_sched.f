      SUBROUTINE DTASK_ACT_SCHED ( REQUEST, ACTPTR, SEQ, SCHEDTIME,
     :  HANDLED, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     DTASK_ACT_SCHED

*  Purpose:
*     Set-up the rescheduling of an action

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DTASK_ACT_SCHED ( REQUEST, ACTPTR, SEQ, SCHEDTIME, HANDLED,
*     :  STATUS )

*  Description:
*       Check for the various reschedule codes that can be returned by
*       an application.

*  Arguments:
*     REQUEST=INTEGER (given)
*           Status returned from the application possibly specifying a
*           reschedule.
*     ACTPTR=INTEGER (given)
*           Pointer to the action in the action list.
*     SEQ=INTEGER (given)
*           The current sequence number for the action.
*     SCHEDTIME=INTEGER (given)
*           Time in milliseconds for reschedule action
*     HANDLED=LOGICAL (returned)
*           Set true if a reschedule was requested
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*       REQUEST indicates the type of reschedule required, one
*       of  ACT__STAGE      Reschedule with no time delay.
*           ACT__WAIT       Reschedule with time delay of SCHEDTIME.
*           ACT__ASTINT     Reschedule on AST (with timeout of SCHEDTIME).
*           ACT__MESSAGE    Reschedule on completion of an action in a
*                           subsidiary task (with timeout of SCHEDTIME).
*
*       If REQUEST is one of these, cancel any "old" timer associated
*       with the action, increment the action counter and set HANDLED
*       true. In the case of ASTINT and MESSAGE, a new timer is started
*       if SCHEDTIME does not have the value INFINITE.
*
*       If REQUEST is not one of the above codes, the routine sets HANDLED
*       to false and returns.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*       The timeout on ACT__ASTINT may cause backward compatability problems
*       if the ACT routine sets a reschedule time and returns ACT__ASTINT
*       without expecting a timeout.
