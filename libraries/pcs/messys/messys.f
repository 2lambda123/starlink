*     If a message is received which has to be returned to the software
*     calling this routine, then translate it from internal to external
*     message structure format and return it along with status
*     information.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:

*     Obtains a pointer to path information ( stored in common in the
*     message system routines ).  This pointer points to complete
*     round-path information.  The task to which the path is being set
*     up is also requested to initialise a connection with this calling
*     task.

*  Arguments:
*     TASK_NAME=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*            name of task to which path is required
*            including machine name if networking
*     PATH=INTEGER ( returned)
*            pointer to the path
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Call the FAMS library.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MESSYS_RECEIVE ( TIMEOUT, PATH, STUFF, MESSID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Receive a data-structure as a message from another process or from
*     an AST event. The path and messid associated with the message are
*     returned to enable the higher-level software to generate replies.
*     The receive is performed with a timeout facility.
*     RECEIVE also handles initialisation of tasks with each other. This
*     is done "invisibly" at lower levels.

*  Arguments:

*     MESSID=INTEGER (returned)
*            message number of incoming message
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Call the FAMS library.
*     If a message is received which has to be returned to the software
*     calling this routine, then translate it from internal to external
*     message structure format and return it along with status information.
