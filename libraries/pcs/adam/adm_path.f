      SUBROUTINE ADAM_PATH ( TASK_NAME, PATH, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ADAM_PATH

*  Purpose:
*     obtain path pointer to another task.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ADAM_PATH ( TASK_NAME, PATH, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Returns a pointer for intertask communication to the task
*     described by TASK_NAME.

*  Arguments:
*     TASK_NAME=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        name of task to which path is required
*     PATH=INTEGER (returned)
*        pointer to the path

*  Algorithm:
*     Call MESSYS_PATH. If this succeeds it will return a status with
*     value ADAM__OK if a new path to the task has been set up, or
*     MESSYS_PATHOPEN if the path already existed.
