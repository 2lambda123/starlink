      SUBROUTINE ADAM_PRCNAM ( NAME, LENGTH, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ADAM_PRCNAM

*  Purpose:
*     gives the name by which the task is to register with MESSYS.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ADAM_PRCNAM ( NAME, LENGTH, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Obtains name by which the task is to register with MESSYS
*     This is the Unix version - returns either the name set by ICL OR the
*     name of the exe running.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME=CHARACTER*(*) (returned)
*        name, with any path information removed
*     LENGTH=INTEGER (returned)
*        length of the name
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     If the environment variable ICL_TASK_NAME exists then take the
*     its translation as the MESSYS task name to use.
*     Otherwise get ARG 0, find the end of any path information and take the
*     the remainder as the name.
