      SUBROUTINE ADAM_RECEIVE ( PATH, CONTEXT, NAME, VALUE,
     :                          MESSID, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ADAM_RECEIVE

*  Purpose:
*     wait for incoming message.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ADAM_RECEIVE ( PATH, CONTEXT, NAME, VALUE, MESSID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Waits for a message to arrive at this task, and returns with the message
*     and associated parameters.
*     If any messages are already waiting on the message list they will be
*     picked up and returned in chronological order by calls to this
*     routine.

*  Arguments:
*     PATH=INTEGER (returned)
*        pointer to the path back to the originating task
*     CONTEXT=INTEGER (returned)
*        parameterised 'get, set, obey, cancel'
*     NAME=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        name of required function or parameter
*     VALUE=CHARACTER*(*) (returned)
*        received message
*     MESSID=INTEGER (given)
*        message number of received message

*  Algorithm:
*     Receive the message data structure using MESSYS_RECEIVE with
*     infinite timeout, and split it into its components.

*  History:
*     3-MAY-1984  first insertion (REVAD::JAC)
*     22-MAY-1984  return "msg_status" as status (REVA::ADAM])
*     10-OCT-1984  change "normal" to "adam__OK" (REVA::ADAM)
*     09-JUN-1986  return message even when status bad (REVAD::BDK)
*     12-NOV-1992:  use SAI__OK not ADAM__OK (RLVAD::AJC)
*        8-MAR-1993: use MESSYS_PAR and MESSYS__INFINITE
*                    not MESDEFNS and INFINITE (RLVAD::AJC)
