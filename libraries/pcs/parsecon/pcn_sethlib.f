*+
*  Name:
*     PARSECON_SETHLIB

*  Purpose:
*     Sets-up parameter help library specifier.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PARSECON_SETHLIB( ENTRY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Loads the provided string into the HLBSTR common store.
*     Also sets LIBSET and HLBLEN.

*  Arguments:
*     ENTRY=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        helplib string
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Superfluous quotes are removed from the given string, its used
*     length is found. The results are entered in the common block.
