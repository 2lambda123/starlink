      SUBROUTINE PARSECON_GPBTOK ( LU, TOKEN, TOKLEN, LINENUM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PARSECON_GPBTOK

*  Purpose:
*     Get next token from interface file.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PARSECON_GPBTOK( [p]... )

*  Description:
*     {routine_description}

*  Get Next Token From Connection File On Given Logical Unit.:
*     Invocation:
*      CALL PARSECON_GPBTOK ( LU; TOKEN, TOKLEN, LINENUM, STATUS )
*     Parameters:
*      LU=INTEGER (given)
*            FORTRAN unit number of interface file.
*      TOKEN=CHARACTER*(*) (returned)
*            next token from interface file.
*      TOKLEN=INTEGER (returned)
*            number of characters in the token.
*      LINENUM=INTEGER (returned)
*            number of line currently being read
*      STATUS=INTEGER
*     Method:
*       Get next token from connection file on given logical unit. This
*       routine calls PARSECON_GETTOK and the only extra task it performs is
*       to discard 'new-record' conditions and count them, allowing
*       track to be kept of the number of the line in the input file
*       which has been reached, which is useful for reporting syntax
*       errors.
*     Deficiencies:
