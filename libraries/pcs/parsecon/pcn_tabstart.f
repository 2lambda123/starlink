      SUBROUTINE PARSECON_TABSTART ( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PARSECON_TABSTART

*  Purpose:
*     Fill the parse state-tables with error states.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PARSECON_TABSTART ( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The two parse-state tables are set so that all their values
*     correspond to invalid parse-states. This is the first stage in
*     initialising the tables.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     The parse-state is stored in two BYTE arrays -
*       ACTTAB - action code
*       STATETAB - new parse state to be entered.
*     All the elements of these are initialised to
*       ACTTAB - ERROR
*       STATETAB - FACEGOT
*     Positions in the tables corresponding to valid parse states will
*     be subsequently overwritten.
