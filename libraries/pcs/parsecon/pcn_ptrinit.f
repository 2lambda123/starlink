      SUBROUTINE PARSECON_PTRINIT ( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PARSECON_PTRINIT

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise pointers etc. before parsing IFL.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PARSECON_PTRINIT ( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Initialises pointers to the various storage lists
*     and various names before the parsing of an interface file begins.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Set the various pointers to zero.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Strictly, all the pointer arrays should be zeroed - eg PARDEF,
*     PARDYN, PARASSOC, NEEDOB, NEEDCAN.....
