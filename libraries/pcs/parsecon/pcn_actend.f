      SUBROUTINE PARSECON_ACTEND ( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PARSECON_ACTEND

*  Purpose:
*     on ENDACTION check for ACTKEY clashes.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PARSECON_ACTEND ( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Check the list of action keywords for a clash
*     and remove the action name from the error report common block.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     The list of action keywords is searched sequentially
*     and set ACNAME to blank.
