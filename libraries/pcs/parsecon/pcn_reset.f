      SUBROUTINE PARSECON_RESET( STATE, STATUS )












*+
*  Name:
*     {routine_name}

*  Purpose:
*     {routine_purpose}

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PARSECON_RESET( STATE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     To reset the parsing STATE to one suitable for recovery
*     after an error.

*  Arguments:
*     STATE = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Given the state in which the error occurred,
*        returns the recovery state.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Actually STATUS is not used but it is included as an argument
*     because it could be helpful in deciding what state to return
*     to and a more complicated routine could want to set it.
