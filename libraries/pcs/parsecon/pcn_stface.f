      SUBROUTINE PARSECON_STFACE ( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PARSECON_STFACE

*  Purpose:
*     Action on INTERFACE field.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PARSECON_STFACE ( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Performs the ENDINTERFACE action if the previous ENDINTERFACE is
*     missing

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Looks at ACNAME. If it is set, the ENDINTERFACE must have been missing
*     so a message is reported and the ENDINTERFACE action routine is called.
*     This checks for correct POSITION numbering.
