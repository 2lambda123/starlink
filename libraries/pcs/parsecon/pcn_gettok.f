      SUBROUTINE PARSECON_GETTOK ( LU, TOKEN, TOKLEN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PARSECON_GETTOK

*  Purpose:
*     Return next token from interface file.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PARSECON_GETTOK ( LU, TOKEN, TOKLEN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Return next token from connection file on given logical unit.

*  Arguments:
*     LU=INTEGER (given)
*        logical unit of connection file
*     TOKEN=CHARACTER*(*) (returned)
*        token
*     TOKLEN=INTEGER (returned)
*        no of chars in token, zero on error, -1 on EOL, -2 on EOF
*     INTEGER STATUS

*  Algorithm:
*     Tokens are returned one at a time from an internal array. When all
*     the tokens in the array have been returned, then a new record is
*     read from the interface file and it is split into tokens and
*     loaded into the storage array, and a condition (TOKLEN=-1) is
*     returned informing the calling routine that a record has been
*     read. On end-of-file TOKLEN=-2 is returned and status set to
*     PARSE__READERR as it shouldn't happen.

*     A token is a sequence of characters which are either all alphanumeric
*     (with {.+-()_[]"'<>/~} being honorary alphanumerics) or are all
*     non-alphanumeric (ie are anything other than alphanumeric and "white").
*     Tokens are thus terminated by either a character of the opposite class
*     or by a "white" character. For the purposes of this routine, a white
*     character is a space, tab, newline, comma or non-printable. Apart from
*     their role as delimiters, white characters are never significant. The
*     exception to this rule is that, as a special case, a token may consist
*     of a set of characters enclosed in single quotes. The first quote must
*     be the first character of the token and the token is terminated by the
*     next isolated (ie.not '') quote or end of buffer (whichever comes
*     first).
*     Hexadecimal constants are recognised and converted to decimal strings.
*     All alphabetic characters other than those in quotes are converted to
*     upper case. All characters on a line that follow a # token are ignored,
*     AS IS THE #.
