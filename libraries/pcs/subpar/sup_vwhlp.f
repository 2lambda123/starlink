      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_VWHLP ( TOPIC, LIBRARY, FLAG, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_VWHLP

*  Purpose:
*     output help.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_VWHLP (TOPIC, LIBRARY, FLAG, STATUS)

*  Description:
*     This is the Unix version of the routine which, for VMS, outputs
*     help information to the terminal using the VMS help system.
*     The routine should never be called. If it is, it indicates either
*     the file extension was not .shl, .hlb or blank, or that a .shl
*     file did not exist.

*  Arguments:
*     LIBRARY=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        the VMS help library to be accessed
*     TOPIC  =CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        the topic within the library on which help is sought
*     FLAG   =INTEGER       (given)
*        non-zero if help library search is required
*     STATUS =INTEGER       (returned)
*        the return status

*  Algorithm:
*     Report an error
