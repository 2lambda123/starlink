      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_WRMSG( STRING, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_WRMSG

*  Purpose:
*     Deliver a message to the user.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_WRMSG( STRING, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The given message string is delivered to the user.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING=CHARACTER * ( * ) (given)
*        The text to be delivered.
*     STATUS=INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     If running as a DCL task, then
*        Write the message to the terminal
*     else
*        The inter-task PATH to the task which issued the RUN command is
*        obtained from the SUBPAR common blocks, and the text-string is
*        sent to that task.
*     endif

*  Notes:
*     This subroutine is provided purely for delivering messages
*     from the Message Reporting System (MSG) to the user. It should not
*     be used for any other purpose. If the attempt to deliver the message
*     fails, an error report is made using EMS_REP.
