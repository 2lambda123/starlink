      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_TERMFACE ( UFACE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_TERMFACE

*  Purpose:
*     set flag saying whether task connected to terminal.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_TERMFACE ( UFACE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Set a flag in the parameter system common blocks saying whether
*     the task is a 'normal' task, or whether, instead, it is being run
*     from a terminal. In the latter case, all output and prompting goes
*     directly to the terminal instead of being sent to another task.

*  Arguments:
*     UFACE=LOGICAL (given)
*        .TRUE. => attached to terminal
*        .FALSE. => controlled by another task
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Set the COMMON variable RUNFACE.
