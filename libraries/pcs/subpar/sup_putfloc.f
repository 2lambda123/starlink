      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_PUTFLOC ( NAMECODE, LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_PUTFLOC

*  Purpose:
*     Stores the top-level HDS locator of a parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_PUTFLOC ( NAMECODE, LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The given locator is stored in the internal storage for the
*     top-level locator associated with the indicated parameter.

*  Arguments:
*     NAMECODE=INTEGER (given)
*        pointer to the parameter
*     LOC=CHARACTER*(DAT__SZLOC) (given)
*        the value of the locator to be associated with the parameter.
*        This is the 'top-level' locator associated with the HDS
*        container file.
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     NAMECODE indexes into the array for holding the locator value.
