    	SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_WRHELP( TOPIC, LIBRARY, FLAG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_WRHELP

*  Purpose:
*     Outputs help information to the terminal using either the portable
*     or VMS help systems, depending on which type of library is
*     available.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_WRHELP( TOPIC, LIBRARY, FLAG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine does any required expansion of logical names in the LIBRARY
*     specification. If the resultant name has no filetype extension or the
*     extension .hlb or .shl, the routine checks for the existence of a file
*     with that name and extension .shl. If it is found, SUBPAR_PWHLP is called
*     to use the portable help system; otherwise SUBPAR_VWHLP is called.
*     On VMS this will use the VMS help system using the library name supplied;
*     on Unix SUBPAR_VWHLP will report an error.
*
*     This option is available to allow a gradual changeover of application
*     package help libraries to the portable system.
*
*     LIBRARY name expansion is handled by SUBPAR_HLPEX which, in the interests
*     of allowing the same interface file to work for VMS or Unix, permits
*     LIBRARY to take the form $ENV/name or ENV:name,  where ENV is a
*     logical-name/environment-variable and name is a simple filename. Either
*     the environment variable or name part may be used alone.
*
*     Environment variables in the VMS form (ENV:) will be forced to upper
*     case for translation, and any associated 'name' to lower case; the
*     Unix form ($ENV) will be translated as given.
*     On VMS this makes no difference but on Unix means that the filename of
*     the library spec must be lower case with extension .shl. The specification in the
*     interface file may be either case and the extension may be omitted.
*
*     The routine will do nothing if STATUS is given as not SAI__OK. If STATUS
*     is OK on entry, the routine will always flush any error reports generated
*     and return  STATUS = SAI__OK.

*  Deficiencies:
*     1.Assumptions about syntax of filenames are made - VMS and Unix forms
*       are catered for.
*     2.Lower case logical names may not be used on VMS
*
*  Arguments:
*     TOPIC = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The topic string
*     LIBRARY = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The help library name
*        It may take the form: NAME,
*                              LOG:NAME,
*                          or  $LOG/NAME
*        where NAME is a filename optionally including directory spec and
*                   filetype.
*          and LOG  is a logical name
*        Note that the VMS system assumes SYSLIB if no directory is specified
*     FLAG = INTEGER (Given)
*        Non-zero if help library search is required
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.
