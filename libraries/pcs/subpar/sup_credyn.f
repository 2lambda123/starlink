      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_CREDYN ( NAMECODE, HDSTYPE, NDIMS, DIMS, BOTLOC,
     :  STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_CREDYN

*  Purpose:
*     Create internal dynamic default storage.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_CREDYN ( NAMECODE, HDSTYPE, NDIMS, DIMS, BOTLOC,

*  Description:
*     Return a locator to internal dynamic default storage associated
*     with a parameter. If space doesn't already exist, create it.

*  Arguments:
*     NAMECODE=INTEGER ( given)
*        pointer to the parameter
*     HDSTYPE=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        type of storage to be created
*     NDIMS=INTEGER (given)
*        number of dimensions required
*     DIMS(*)=INTEGER (given)
*        size of dimensions required
*     BOTLOC=CHARACTER*(DAT__SZLOC) (returned)
*        locator to the created storage
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     The top-level locator to the program's private storage for dynamic
*     defaults is obtained at program activation and stored in common.
*     The required space is created beneath this locator, with the same
*     name as the parameter.
*     If the space already exists, then it is deleted and re-created.
