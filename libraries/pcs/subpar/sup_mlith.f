*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_MONOLITH

*  Purpose:
*     To check if the task is a monolith.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_MONOLITH( MONO, status )

*  Description:
*     The routine copies the variable MONOLITH from the SUBPAR
*     COMMON block SUBPARPTR.

*  Arguments:
*     MONO = LOGICAL (Returned)
