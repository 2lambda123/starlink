      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_UPDAT ( NAMECODE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_UPDAT

*  Purpose:
*     Force HDS update.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_UPDAT ( NAMECODE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Force the HDS file associated with the indicated parameter to be
*     updated, so that its memory cache coincides with the data on disk.

*  Arguments:
*     NAMECODE=INTEGER
*        pointer to parameter associated with an HDS structure
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Use the locator to the container file for the parameter in a call
*     to HDS_FREE.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Not part of the SSE interfaces. This routine is provided
*     specifically for ADAM multitasking operations.
