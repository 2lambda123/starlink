      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_PUTPATH ( PATH, MESSID, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_PUTPATH

*  Purpose:
*     Store the message path for parameter requests.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_PUTPATH ( PATH, MESSID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The given message-system path and message id numbers are stored
*     in the SUBPAR common blocks. They are used by A-tasks which have
*     to request a parameter value from the task which issued the RUN
*     command.

*  Arguments:
*     PATH=INTEGER (given)
*        message system path to the controlling task
*     MESSID=INTEGER (given)
*        message identification number as known to the controlling
*        task.
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     Copy the given path and messid into the COMMON variables RUNPATH
*     and RUNID.
*     Set the parameter request error message to ' '.
