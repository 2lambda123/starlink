      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_PUT(LOC, TYPE, NDIM, DIMS, VALUES, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     NAME

*  Purpose:
*     SUBPAR_PUT.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_PUT(LOC, TYPE, NDIM, DIMS, VALUES, STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Put data into the HDS primitive item described by locator
*     copying the values from the character string array
*     VALUES.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC  =  CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        locator to component to be written
*     TYPE =  CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        HDS type name of the primitive item
*     NDIM =  INTEGER (given)
*        Number of dimensions of data to be written
*     DIMS(NDIM) = INTEGER (given)
*        Array containing dimensions of data
*     VALUES(*) = CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        Array containing the values to be written
*     STATUS = INTEGER
*        Status return

*  Algorithm:
*     Call DAT_PUTC.
*     This routine could be replaced by direct calls to
*     DAT_PUTC.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     The dimensions must match that of the HDS item.
