      INTEGER FUNCTION SUBPAR_IPUT( TEXT, PROMPT, RESLEN )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_IPUT

*  Purpose:
*     To prompt the user for input
*     For use with HELP output routine
*     This is the Unix version

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = SUBPAR_IPUT( TEXT, PROMPT, RESLEN )

*  Description:
*     The routine obtains input from the user after prompting.
*     The routine uses ICL_READA to prompt and obtain the response.
*     The paging line counter is reset and the function value set
*     appropriately.

*  Deficiencies:
*     This routine will always return the OK value.

*  Arguments:
*     TEXT = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Variable to receive the input text
*     PROMPT = CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        The prompt to be used
*     RESLEN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The used length of the reply

*  Returned Value:
*     SUBPAR_IPUT = INTEGER
*        1 if the routine is successful
*        An error status value if not (ls bit 0)

*  Local Variables:
      INTEGER PRLEN              ! Prompt string used length

*   Prompt and receive reply
      PRLEN = LEN( PROMPT )
      CALL ICL_READA( PROMPT, PRLEN, PROMPT, PRLEN,
     : TEXT, LEN(TEXT), ' ', 0 )

*   Find the used length of the string
      RESLEN = CHR_LEN( TEXT )

*   Reset line count
      SUBPARLCNT = SUBPARPGSZ

*   Set reply value - always good
      SUBPAR_IPUT = 1
