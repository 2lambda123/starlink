      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_INTLOC ( NAMECODE, LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_INTLOC

*  Purpose:
*     Get locator to 'private' store associated with a parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_INTLOC ( NAMECODE, LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Given the index of a program parameter, try to get a locator to
*     its associated 'private' HDS storage. If this is
*     successful, the information is stored associated with the
*     parameter and the HDS locator is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     NAMECODE=INTEGER (given)
*        Internal number identifying program parameter
*     LOC=CHARACTER*DAT__SZLOC (returned)
*        Locator to data structure
*     STATUS=INTEGER
*        Status return

*  Algorithm:
*     The top-level locator to 'private' storage is obtained from
*     COMMON. A locator is requested for the named component.
*     If this is successful, the parameter is marked as active and as
*     stored 'privately', and the locators are copied into the
*     parameter's internal character store. A clone of the bottom-level
*     locator is returned.

*   Store the locators with the parameter, and link them to the

*    Associate the parameter name with both copies of the

*    to annul the locator without knowing its value.
*    -- NB this must not be done with FILOC - it must only be
*    annulled via a call to HDS_CLOSE.
