      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_DEF1R ( NAMECODE, NVAL, VALUES, STATUS )
      IMPLICIT NONE

*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_DEF1R

*  Purpose:
*     Set dynamic default vector values.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_DEF1R ( NAMECODE, NVAL, VALUES, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Set default values for a vector primitive object associated with
*     a Parameter.
*     If there are six or less values they are stored in COMMON. The COMMON
*     area used corresponds with the type of value supplied. If the type and
*     number enables previously allocated dynamic default storage to be re-
*     used, that is done, otherwise new storage is allocated.
*     If there are more than six values, or there is no more storage space
*     left, the values are stored in an HDS object.
*     If NVAL is given as 0, a scalar is assumed. This allows this routine
*     to be called by the corresponding SUBPAR_DEF0 routine.
*
*     PARDYN(1,-) is set = 0 by SUBPAR activation (PARSECON_NEWPAR or
*     SUBPAR_LDIFC0/1), to the supplied dynamic default type by this routine
*     (or 20+type by SUBPAR_DEFN) and is negated if the dynamic default is
*     cancelled (by SUBPAR_UNSET) - the same allocated space can then be re-
*     used within the same task invocation.
*     At SUBPAR deactivation (SUBPAR_DEACT), PARDYN(1,-) is reset to 0
*     indicating that no space is allocated for dynamic defaults and the
*     list pointer is reset to its value after reading the interface file,
*     thus resetting everything for another invocation of the task
*     Therefore, PARDYN(1,-).GT.0 means space is allocated,
*           and  PARDYN(3,-).GT.0 (=type) means the space is in use
*           and  PARDYN(3,-).LT.0 (=-type) means the space is not in use.

*  Arguments:
*     NAMECODE=INTEGER (given)
*        code-number of the parameter
*     NVAL=INTEGER
*        Expression specifying the number of default values.
*        This must match the object size.
*     VALUES(NVAL)=REAL
*        Array containing the default values .
*     STATUS=INTEGER

*  History:
*     10-DEC-1984 (BDK):
*        Original
*     21-MAR-1986 (BDK):
*        Store small arrays in COMMON
*     16-SEP-1986 (BDK):
*        Correct indexing into VALUES
*     09-JUL-1990 (AJC):
*        Use 'type' as 'in use' flag
*     11-OCT-1990 (AJC):
*        Change PARDYN(3,-) test to .LE.0 so .IFCs work
*     28-JAN-1992 (AJC):
*        Save in type supplied - for efficiency and portability
*      9-MAR-1992 (AJC):
*        Assume NVAL 0 means a scalar value
*     23-MAR 1992 (AJC)
*        Re-structure to correctly re-use space
*     22-JUL-1992 (AJC)
*        Use PARDYN(1,-) as 'space allocated' flag
*        Re-use space if sufficient for new values (not just equal)
*        If cannot re-use space allocate more if available.
*      1-MAR-1993 (AJC):
*        Add INCLUDE DAT_PAR
