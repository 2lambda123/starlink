      SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_TSKNM( TSKNAM, PFNAM, IFNAM, IFC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_TSKNM

*  Purpose:
*     To obtain the full names of the interface file and parameter
*     file associated with the task.
*     This routine is expected to be machine dependent

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_TSKNM( TSKNAM, PFNAM, IFNAM, IFC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine finds the full name of the executable image being
*     run then constructs from it the parameter file name, using the
*     directory defined by the SUBPAR_ADMUS routine.
*     It then searches the ADAM_IFL path to find the first occurrence
*     of a .IFL or .IFC file with the same name.

*  Arguments:
*     TSKNAM = CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        The name of the task (derived from the executable name)
*     PFNAM = CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        The full name of the associated parameter file
*     IFNAM = CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        The full name of the interface file
*     IFC = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        TRUE if the interface module is an IFC.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     11-JUL-1991 (AJC):
*        Original version.
*     10-FEB-1992 (AJC):
*        Use SUBPAR_ADMUS.
*     12-FEB-1992 (AJC):
*        Correct access mode for interface files
*     05-MAR-1992 (AJC):
*        Improve interface file not found report
*     12-MAR-1995 (AJC):
*        Trap error from SUBPAR_ADMUS now it tries to create directory
*     27-JUL-2004 (TIMJ):
*        Recognize if we are running from libtool build directory.
*        Important for testing purposes so that A-task tests can run
*        from a libtool/autoconf build. Should be harmless unless an
*        A-task really does start with lt- !
*     11-AUG-2005 (TIMJ):
*        Not all fortran compilers have the ACCESS intrinsic and not
*        all compilers allow an intrinsic to be marked as EXTERNAL.
*        To remove these portability concerns, now call PSX_ACCESS
*        rather than the ACCESS intrinsic. A version was present in
*        pcs/misc/access.c but it was not being used on all compilers.
*     15-FEB-2006 (TIMJ):
*        Change calling scheme for PSX_ACCESS
