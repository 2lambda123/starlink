*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_TRMSZ

*  Purpose:
*     A Fortran callable function to obtain the size of the output screen.

*  Language:
*     C

*  Invocation:
*     ISTAT = SUBPAR_TRMSZ( WIDTH, HEIGHT )

*  Description:
*     The routine uses the ioctl system to obtain the window size for
*     stdout.
*     Compile with -I/star/include (use gcc on Sun)

*     {routine_description}

*  Arguments:
*     WIDTH = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The width of the screen (characters)
*     HEIGHT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The height of the screen (lines)

*  Returned Value:
*     SUBPAR_TRMSZ = INTEGER
*        Returns 1 on success; 0 on failure.
