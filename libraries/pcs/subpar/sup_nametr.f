    	SUBROUTINE SUBPAR_NAMETR( COMMAND, INNAME, OUTNM, HSTAT )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUBPAR_NAMETR

*  Purpose:
*     Translates names for the portable help system used within adam.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUBPAR_NAMETR(  COMMAND, INNAME, OUTNM, HSTAT )

*  Description:
*     The routine expands the given filename according to the ADAM rules,
*     translating environment variables etc. (see SUBPAR_HLPEX).
*     If no filetype is specified .shl is assumed.
*     If the expansion is a full pathname, that is used
*     If not, an attempt is made to find the file along the path defined by the
*     environment variable ADAM_HELP.
*     If that fails, an attempt is made to find the file in /star/help.
*     If that fails, bad status is returned.
*
*     The routine will do nothing if COMMAND is not 0
*
*  Deficiencies:
*     Assumptions about syntax of filenames are made - VMS and Unix forms
*     are catered for.
*
*  Arguments:
*     COMMAND = INTEGER (Given)
*        Not used
*     INNAME = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The given name
*     OUTNM = CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        The translated name
*     HSTAT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The HLP system status.
