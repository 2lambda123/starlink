      INTEGER FUNCTION STRING_INANYR ( STRING, CHOICE )
*+
*  Name:
*     STRING_INANYR

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     INTEGER FUNCTION

*  Invocation:
*     POSITION = STRING_INANYR ( STRING, CHOICE )

*  Description:
*     Finds the position of the last character in STRING which matches 
*     none of the characters in CHOICE.

*  Algorithm:
*     Each character of STRING is compared with the characters in CHOICE 
*     until a mismatch is found, or STRING is exhausted, starting with the 
*     last character of STRING and working towards its start.

*  Result:
*     POSITION = INTEGER
*           The value returned is the position in STRING at which the 
*           rightmost character mismatch occurs.
*           If no mismatch found, then POSITION is set to zero.
