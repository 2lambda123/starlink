      SUBROUTINE STRING_STRIPQUOT ( ENTRY, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     STRING_STRIPQUOT

*  Purpose:
*     Remove surrounding quotes and escaped quotes

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL STRING_STRIPQUOT ( ENTRY, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Produces the 'value' of a character string formatted following
*     FORTRAN 77 syntax - ie. It is contained within single quotes, but
*     the single quote character can be included as part of the string
*     by doubling it.
*     If the given string contains no quotes, then it is simply copied
*     to the output string.

*  Arguments:
*     ENTRY=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*           The value-string to be interpreted
*     VALUE=CHARACTER*(*) (returned)
*           The processed string
*     STATUS=INTEGER (returned)

*  Algorithm:
*     The quotes surrounding the input string are found. The characters
*     between them are copied to the output string, pairs of quotes
*     being contracted to single quotes.
