      SUBROUTINE DAT_UPDAT ( PARAM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DAT_UPDAT

*  Purpose:
*     Force HDS update.

*  Language:
*     Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DAT_UPDAT ( PARAM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     If there is an HDS object associated with the parameter, force
*     its container file to be freed so that its memory cache coincides
*     with the data on disk and the file is available for other programs
*     to use.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        Name of program parameter.
*     STATUS=INTEGER (given and returned)
*        Global status

*  Algorithm:
*     Use the SUBPAR routines to look-up the parameter and update the
*     HDS file on disk (SUBPAR_UPDAT calls HDS_FREE).
