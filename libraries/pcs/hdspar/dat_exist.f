      SUBROUTINE DAT_EXIST ( PARAM, ACCESS, LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DAT_EXIST

*  Purpose:
*     Return a locator associated with a parameter.

*  Language:
*     Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DAT_EXIST ( PARAM, ACCESS, LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An HDS locator for the data object associated with the specified
*     parameter is returned. The parameter system will attempt to associate 
*     an object if one is not already associated. This operation is identical 
*     with DAT_ASSOC except under error conditions. When there is an error,
*     DAT_EXIST reports the error and returns the status value immediately,
*     whereas DAT_ASSOC repeatedly attempts to get a valid locator.
*     If the named object does not exist, status PAR__ERROR is returned.
*
*     The object will be opened with the appropriate ACCESS mode. If ACCESS
*     is incompatible with the access mode specified for the parameter in 
*     the program's Interface File, status SUBPAR__ICACM will be returned.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        program parameter name
*     ACCESS=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        Access mode, 'READ', 'WRITE' or 'UPDATE'
*        (case insignificant)
*     LOC=CHARACTER*(*) (returned)
*        Locator to the associated data object
*     STATUS=INTEGER (given and returned)
*        Global status

*  Algorithm:
*     Use SUBPAR to get the parameter number, and then perform the
*     operation.
