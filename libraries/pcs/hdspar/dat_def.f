      SUBROUTINE DAT_DEF ( PARAM, LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DAT_DEF

*  Purpose:
*     Suggest values for parameter.

*  Language:
*     Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DAT_DEF ( PARAM, LOC, STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Set a data-system object as the dynamic default for a parameter.
*     The given locator must be valid when DAT_DEF is called but may
*     be annulled before the dynamic default is used.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        Name of program parameter.
*     LOC=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        Locator to a data object.
*     STATUS=INTEGER (given and returned)
*        Global status

*  Algorithm:
*     Use SUBPAR to get the pointer to the parameter, and store the HDS
*     name of the indicated object.
