      SUBROUTINE DAT_DELET ( PARAM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DAT_DELET

*  Purpose:
*     Delete an object associated with a parameter

*  Language:
*     Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DAT_DELET ( PARAM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Get an object name and delete the object.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        Name of program parameter
*     STATUS=INTEGER (given and returned)
*        Global status

*  Algorithm:
*     The character string associated with the given parameter is
*     obtained, and interpreted as a filename (an HDS container
*     file), followed by the full name of the structure component
*     required. The component is deleted if possible. The data structure
*     down to the level immediately above the required new component
*     must exist already.
*     Cancel the parameter.
