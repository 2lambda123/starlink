      SUBROUTINE DAT_ASSOC ( PARAM, ACCESS, LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DAT_ASSOC

*  Purpose:
*     Return a locator associated with a parameter.

*  Language:
*     Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DAT_ASSOC ( PARAM, ACCESS, LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An HDS locator for the data object associated with the specified
*     parameter is returned. The parameter system will attempt to associate 
*     an object if one is not already associated. In the event of a failure,
*     an error message will be displayed and another attempt made (usually
*     by prompting the user). Up to five attempts will be made, after which
*     status PAR__NULL will be returned.
*
*     The object will be opened with the appropriate ACCESS mode. If ACCESS
*     is incompatible with the access mode specified for the parameter in 
*     the program's Interface File, status SUBPAR__ICACM will be returned.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        Name of program parameter
*     ACCESS=CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*        Access mode, 'READ', 'WRITE' or 'UPDATE'
*        (case insignificant)
*     LOC=CHARACTER*(*) (returned)
*        Locator to the associated data object
*     STATUS=INTEGER (given and returned)
*        Global status

*  Algorithm:
*     The named parameter is found and its identifying number obtained.
*     SUBPAR_ASSOC the does the work of obtaining a locator.
