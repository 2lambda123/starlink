      SUBROUTINE LEX_PARSE(INIT,STRING,NSTATE,TABLE,ACTION,TOKEN,
     :      TLEN,POSN,STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     name

*  Purpose:
*     LEX_PARSE

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LEX_PARSE(INIT,STRING,NSTATE,TABLE,ACTION,TOKEN,
*     :      TLEN,POSN,STATUS)

*  Description:
*     LEX parser - main routine

*  Arguments:
*     INIT = LOGICAL (given)
*           If TRUE a parse of a new string is initiated, otherwise
*           a continuation of a current parse
*     STRING = CHARACTER*(*) (given)
*           The string to be parsed
*     NSTATE = INTEGER (given)
*           The number of states in the state table
*     TABLE(4,0:127,NSTATE) = BYTE (given)
*           The state table
*     ACTION = INTEGER (returned)
*           Action code of action to be performed
*     TOKEN = CHARACTER*(*) (returned)
*           Token string
*     TLEN = INTEGER (returned)
*           Length of token string
*     POSN = INTEGER (returned)
*           Current position in parse
*     STATUS = INTEGER

*  Algorithm:
*     On the initital call (INIT = TRUE) the character position is
*     set to 1, and the state is set to 1. Then for each character
*     the entry in the state table is found corresponding to the
*     current character and state. This entry specifies the new state,
*     a code which can be some combination of BACK, COPY, WRITE and
*     STACK, and optionally an ACTION. If an action is specified
*     the routine returns to its caller with the action number and
*     current token. Otherwise it advances to the next character
*     (unless BACK is specified). It also returns to the caller in the
*     event of an invalid character for the state, or on reaching the
*     end of the string.
