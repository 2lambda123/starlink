1 PCS Version 4.1-2

When a parameter file returns DAT__INCHK a report recommending
the removal of the file (including its fullname) is now made.
Changes to subpar/sup_deact.f and subpar/sup_crint.f.

1 PCS Version 4.1-1

LEX_PARSE now initialises the output token string to prevent warnings from the
memory checker. (Fix courtesy of Tim Jenness, JACH.)

1 PCS Version 4.1

A new subroutine SUBPAR_GREF provides the functionality required by the MERS
routine MSG1_GREF. Use of the new routine by MERS (Version 1.8) allows easier
replacement of the underlying Parameter System (in particular the Java (JPCS)
Parameter System to be substituted for PCS SUBPAR). (Older versions of MERS
will still work with this version of PCS.)

A bug in the LEX libarary has been fixed to allow correct parsing of the square
brackets in a command-line specifier such as IN=file.fits[2]. 

1 PCS Version 4.0-1

This version fixes some minor bugs in SUBPAR and makes subpar_err.h a 'public'
file in /star/include. Documents SUN/115 and SUN/134 have been moved into this
package but there are no significant changes to them.

Bugs fixed:
  1. Correctly handle INTERNAL parameter values given on the command line.
  2. Improve error messages if truncation occurs in SUBPAR_GET0C.
  3. Memory leak in SUBPAR_FIFIL.
  
1 PCS Version 4.0 for Unix has been released.

 This version removes the ADAM and MESSYS layers of the ADAM message system.
 DTASK, TASK and SUBPAR subroutines now call the Fortran interface to AMS
 directly. Executables are significantly smaller and message handling is more
 efficient. There should be no functional changes and it should not be
 necessary to re-link tasks unless they use shared PCS libraries.

 In addition;

 1. A new document SUN/241 describes AMS for Programmers.

 2. A new document SSN/77 describes the way an ADAM task interacts with the
    ADAM message system.

 3. SUN/144 and SSN/29 have been updated.

 4. Environment variable ADAM_NOPROMPT may now be set to prevent any prompts
    from a task. Error status will result if a prompt is required to obtain
    a parameter value or resolve an ambiguous keyword.

 5. There have been parameter system internal mods to assist in handling
    groups of NDFs in CCDPACK.
