*  Purpose:
*     Write the contents of a FitsChan to a text file.

*  Language:
*     C.

*  Invocation:
*     void atlDumpFits( const char *param, AstFitsChan *fc, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new text file containing the contents of
*     the supplied FitsChan as a set of FITS header cards. The name of
*     the text file is obtained via the evironment using a specified
*     parameter.

*  Arguments:
*     param
*        The parameter name.
*     fc
*        A pointer to the FitsChan.
