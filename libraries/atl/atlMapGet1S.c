*  Name:
*     atlMapGet1S

*  Purpose:
*     Retrieve a vector of strings from an AST KeyMap entry as a list
*     of fixed length strings.

*  Language:
*     C.

*  Invocation:
*     int atlMapGet1S( AstKeyMap *this, const char *key, int bufsize, 
*                      int len, int *nval, char *buf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function retrieves the null-terminated strings from a vector
*     element in a KeyMap, and concatenates them into a list of fixed
*     length strings, each padded with spaces.

*  Arguments:
*     this
*        A pointer to the KeyMap.
*     key
*        The key for the entry.
*     bufsize
*        The length of the "buf" array.
*     len
*        The required size ofr each fixed length string.
*     nval
*        Address of an int in which to return the number of fixed length
*        strings returned in "buf". This will be less than the number of
*        elements in the KeyMap entry if the supplied buffer is not large
*        enough to hold all the strings in the entry.
*     buf
*        A pointer to a buffer in which to return the concatenated, fixed
*        length strings.
*     status
*        Pointer to the global status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     Non-zero if an entry with the given key was found in the KeyMap,
*     and zero otherwise.
