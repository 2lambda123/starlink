      SUBROUTINE ATL_MGFTS( METHOD, FC1, FC2, FC3, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ATL_MGFTS

*  Purpose:
*     Merge two FITS headers.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ATL_MGFTS( METHOD, FC1, FC2, FC3, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine merges two FITS headers, each supplied in an AST
*     FitsChan, in one of several different ways. The resulting merged
*     list of headers is returned in a new FitsChan. 

*  Arguments:
*     METHOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Indicates how the two FITS headers should be merged:
*        
*        1 - Concatenation. Store the contents of FC1 in the returned 
*            FitsChan, and then append the contents of FC2 to the end of 
*            the returned FitsChan. No checks are made for multiple 
*            occurences of the same keyword.
*
*        2 - Union (with priority given to FC2): For every header in FC1, see 
*            if FC2 contains the same keyword. If it does not, copy the FC1 
*            header to the returned FitsChan. Then append the contents of FC2 
*            to the end of the returned FitsChan.
*
*        3 - Overlap: For every header in FC1, see if FC2 contains the same 
*            keyword. If it does, and if the keyword value is the same in
*            both FitsChans, copy the FC1 header to the returned FitsChan. 
*     FC1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the first FitsChan. 
*     FC2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the second FitsChan. 
*     FC3 = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Pointer to the returned FitsChan. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The contents of FC1 and FC2 are unchanged on exit.
*     -  For METHOD 3 (overlap), floating point values are compared 
*     by formatting into a string (using the accuracy specified by the
*     FitsDigits attributes of the two supplied FitsChans) and then
*     comparing the formatted strings for exact equality.

*  History:
*     7-FEB-2007 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     8-FEB-2007 (DSB):
*        Take account of header cards that have no value (e.g. blank
*        cards, comment cards, etc).
*     15-JUN-2008 (TIMJ):
*        Fix typo for method 2
*     26-JUN-2008 (DSB):
*        Correct AST_SET to AST_SETI.
*     4-DEC-2008 (TIMJ):
*        Rewrite to use AST_TESTFITS now that AST_GETFITSS no longer
*        allows undef values.
