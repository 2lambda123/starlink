*  Name:
*     ATL_ADDWCSAXIS

*  Purpose:
*     Add one or more axes to an NDFs WCS FrameSet.

*  Language:
*     C, designed to be called from Fortran.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ATL_ADDWCSAXIS( WCS, MAP, FRM, LBND, UBND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine adds one or more new axes to all the Frames in an NDF
*     WCS FrameSet. Frames that are known to be NDF-special (e.g. GRID,
*     AXIS, PIXEL and FRACTION) are expanded to include a number of extra
*     appropriate axes equal to the Nin attribute of the supplied Mapping.
*     all other Frames in the FrameSet are replaced by CmpFrames holding the
*     original Frame and the supplied Frame. These new axes are connected to
*     the new GRID axes using the supplied Mapping.

*  Arguments:
*     WCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to a FrameSet that is to be used as the WCS FrameSet in
*        an NDF. This imposes the restriction that the base Frame must
*        have Domain GRID.
*     MAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to a Mapping. The forward transformation should transform
*        the new GRID axes into the new WCS axes.
*     FRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to a Frame defining the new WCS axes.
*     LBND() = INTEGER (Given)
*        An array holding the lower pixel index bounds on the new axes.
*        The length of this array should beq aual to the Nin attribute of
*        the MAP Mapping.
*     UBND() = INTEGER (Given)
*        An array holding the upper pixel index bounds on the new axes.
*        The length of this array should beq aual to the Nin attribute of
*        the MAP Mapping.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - This routine is just a wrapper around the C function atlAddWcsAxis.
*     - The new axes are appended to the end of the existing axes, so the
*     axis indices associated with the new axes will extend from "nold+1"
*     to "nold+nnew", where "nold" is the number of axes in the original
*     Frame, and "nnew" is the number of new axes.
*     - An error will be reported if the Nout attribute of "map" is
*     different to the Naxes attribute of "frm".
