      SUBROUTINE ATL_FSPEC( FRM, SPAX, SPFRM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ATL_FSPEC

*  Purpose:
*     Locate a SpecFrame within a CmpFrame.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ATL_FSPEC( FRM, SPAX, SPFRM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine searches the supplied CmpFrame for an axis that is a
*     SpecFrame. It returns the axis index of the SpecFrame within the
*     CmpFrame, and also returns a pointer to the SpecFrame itself.
*
*     No error is reported if the CmpFrame does not contain a SpecFrame.
*     If the CmpFrame contains more than one SpecFrame, the first (i.e.
*     the lowest index) is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     FRM= INTEGER (Given)
*        The CmpFrame pointer.
*     SPAX = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index of the spectral axis within the CmpFrame. Returned
*        equal to zero if no spectral axis is found.
*     SPFRM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to the SpecFrame. Returned equal to AST__NULL if no 
*        spectral axis is found.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
