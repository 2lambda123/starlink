1 ALT_library

An new release (V1.1) of the ATL library is now available. The ATL
library contains high level AST-related utility functions. See SUN/256
for details. Changed in the new version include:

- A new C function, astGetParam, obtains a value for a named parameter 
from the environment, and places the value in a supplied AST KeyMap. The 
name of the parameter is used as the key for the new KeyMap entry.
