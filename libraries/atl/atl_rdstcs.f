*+
*  Name:
*     ATL_RDSTCS

*  Purpose:
*     Read an AST Object from a GRP group using an StcsChan.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ATL_RDSTCS( IGRP, IAST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Read an AST Object from a GRP group using an StcsChan.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group holding the text.
*     IAST = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The AST Object, or AST__NULL.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
