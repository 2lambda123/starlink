*+
*  Name:
*     ATL_CREAT

*  Purpose:
*     Write an AST Object to a text file or NDF specified using an environment
*     parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ATL_CREAT( PARAM, IAST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Write an AST Object to a text file or NDF specified using an environment
*     parameter.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter name.
*     IAST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The AST Object, or AST__NULL.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     12-JAN-2001 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     15-SEP-2003 (DSB):
*        Changed call to FIO_ANNUL to FIO_CLOSE. Previously the output
*        text file was not completely flushed when being used as a
*        monolith (e.g. from ICL), resulting in incomplete output files.
*     11-MAY-2006 (DSB):
*        Increase maximum line length to 300 characters.
*     30-MAY-2006 (DSB):
*        Moved into ATL library and changed prefix from "ATL1_" to "ATL_".
