      SUBROUTINE ATL_RDCH( IGRP, IAST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ATL_RDCH

*  Purpose:
*     Read an AST Object from a GRP group using a Channel.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ATL_RDCH( IGRP, IAST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Read an AST Object from a GRP group using a Channel.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group holding the text.
*     IAST = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The AST Object, or AST__NULL.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - If the group contains the dump of a Channel (of any class),
*     then the Object returned via IAST will be the Channel itself. The
*     exception to this is that if the "Begin " line at the start of
*     the dump ends with the string "(Read)", then the returned IAST
*     Object will be the Object read from the Channel, rather than the
*     Channel itself. For instance, if the group contains the dump of a
*     FitsChan, and the first line of the dump is "Begin FitsChan(Read)",
*     then the returned IAST object will be the Object read from the
*     FitsChan, rather than the FitsChan itself. This facility is only
*     available for top level objects (e.g. FitsChans contained within
*     FitsChans cannot be read in this way).

*        Channel itself. Only one level of Channel nesting is allowed.
