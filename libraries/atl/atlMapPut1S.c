*  Name:
*     atlMapPut1S

*  Purpose:
*     Create a vector character string entry in an AST KeyMap from a list
*     of fixed length strings.

*  Language:
*     C.

*  Invocation:
*     void atlMapPut1S( AstKeyMap *this, const char *key, const char *value,
*                       int len, int size, const char *comment, int *status );

*  Description:
*     This function splits up a supplied character array into a set of 
*     equal length sub-strings, null terminates them, and stores them 
*     as a character vector in a KeyMap. See also atlMapGet1S.

*  Arguments:
*     this
*        A pointer to an existing KeyMap.
*     key
*        The key  for the new entry.
*     value
*        A character array containing the concatenated fixed length 
*        strings. The length of this array should be at least "size*len".
*     len
*        The length of each fixed length string.
*     size
*        The number of fixed length strings in "value".
*     status
*        Pointer to the global status variable.
