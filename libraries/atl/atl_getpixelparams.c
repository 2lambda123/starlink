*  Name:
*     ATL_GETPIXELPARAMS

*  Purpose:
*     Find typical values for "FITS-like" parameters describing a FrameSet.

*  Language:
*     C, designed to be called from Fortran.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ATL_GETPIXELPARAMS( FSET, DIMS, DEGS, CRPIX, CRVAL, CDELT,
*                              CROTA, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This function finds values that resemble the the FITS keywords
*     CRVAL1/2/3.., CRPIX1/2/3..., CRDELT1/2/3... and CROTA2, on the
*     assumption that the base Frame in the supplied FrameSet describe
*     GRID coords (i.e. FITS pixel coords), and the current Frame describe
*     the required WCS.  It is not restricted to 2D FrameSets.
*
*     If the FrameSet can be written to a FitsChan successfully using
*     FITS-WCS encoding, the the resulting keyword values are returned.
*     Otherwise, the values are estimated by transforming closely spaced
*     pixel positions along each axis. If the current Frame contains a
*     SkyFrame, and the SkyFrame has a defined reference position, then
*     this position specifies the returned CRVAL values. Otherwise, the
*     reference position is assumed to be at the central pixel.

*  Arguments:
*     FSET = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FrameSet.
*     DIMS(*) = INTEGER (Given)
*        An array supplied holding the number of pixels along each
*        edge of the pixel array. The number of elements in this array
*        should match the number of axes in the base Frame of FSET.
*     DEGS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., then the CRVAL, CDELT and CROTA values for sky axes
*        are returned in units of degrees. Otherwise they are returned in
*        radians.
*     CRPIX(*) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        An array returned holding the position of the reference pixel
*        in the base Frame of FSET. The number of elements in this
*        array should match the number of axes in the base Frame of FSET.
*     CRVAL(*) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        An array returned holding the position of the reference pixel
*        in the current Frame of FSET. The number of elements in this
*        array should match the number of axes in the current Frame of
*        FSET.
*     CDELT(*) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        An array returned holding the geodesic distance along each
*        edge of the reference pixel, measured within the current
*        Frame of FSET. The number of elements in this array should
*        match the number of axes in the base Frame of FSET.
*     CROTA = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The angle from north in the current frame of FSET to the
*        second spatial pixel axis, measured positive through east.
*        This will be returned set to AST__BAD if the current frame
*        of FSET does not contain a SkyFrame.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
