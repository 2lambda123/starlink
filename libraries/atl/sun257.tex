   Add one or more axes to an NDFs WCS FrameSet
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine adds one or more new axes to all the Frames in an NDF
      WCS FrameSet. Frames that are known to be NDF-special (e.g. GRID,
      AXIS, PIXEL and FRACTION) are expanded to include a number of extra
      appropriate axes equal to the Nin attribute of the supplied Mapping.
      all other Frames in the FrameSet are replaced by CmpFrames holding the
      original Frame and the supplied Frame. These new axes are connected to
      the new GRID axes using the supplied Mapping.

         axis indices associated with the new axes will extend from \texttt{"}nold$+$1\texttt{"}

         Frame, and \texttt{"}nnew\texttt{"} is the number of new axes.

         \sstitem
         An error will be reported if the Nout attribute of \texttt{"}map\texttt{"} is
         different to the Naxes attribute of \texttt{"}frm\texttt{"}.

\sstroutine{
   ATL\_AXTRM
}{
   Trim axes from the current Frame of a FrameSet
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine ensures that the number of axes in the current
      Frame of the supplied FrameSet is the same as the number in
      the base Frame. If this is not the case on entry, one or more
      new Frames with the required number of axes are created and
      added into the FrameSet, one of which becomes the new current
      Frame. The only case in which more than one new Frame is added
      is if the current Frame has too many axes, and the FrameSet
      contains more than one \texttt{"}ROI\texttt{"} Frame (that is, Frames which are
      Regions and which have a Domain name beginning with \texttt{"}ROI\texttt{"}). If
      the FrameSet contains zero or one ROI Frame, then only a single
      new Frame is added into the FrameSet.

      If the original current Frame has too few axes, the new Frame
      is a copy of the original current Frame with extra simple axes
      added to the end. These extra axes are supplied a value of
      AST\_\_BAD by the Mapping which connects the original current
      Frame to the new current Frame.

      If the original current Frame has too many axes, one or more
      new Frames will be created by picking the specified axes from
      the original current Frame. Each of these Frames is added into
      the FrameSet using a Mapping which has a forward transformation
      which simply drops the values for the unselected axes. The
      inverse transformation (from new to old Frame) attempts to
      assign usable values for the dropped axes if possible. If this
      is not possible, then AST\_\_BAD is assigned to the dropped axes.

      Two methods are used for finding suitable values to assign to
      dropped axes. The first is only possible if the value for a
      dropped axis can be determined uniquely from the value of one
      of the retained axes. This may be the case for instance in a
      situation where (RA,wavelength) axes were selected from the
      (RA,Dec,Wavelength) axes describing a 2D longslit spectrum. The
      missing Dec value can probably be determined from the RA value
      because the relationship between RA and Dec is determined by the
      position and orientation of the slit on the sky.

      If it is not possible to determine the value for a dropped axis
      in this way, then a search is made for Frames that are Regions
      having a Domain name beginning with \texttt{"}ROI\texttt{"}. If any are found,
      then a new Frame is added into the FrameSet for each ROI Region
      found, connected to the original current Frame via a PermMap.
      The values to be assigned to the dropped axes by the inverse
      PermMap transformation are determined by transforming the
      bounding box of the corresponding ROI Region into the original
      current Frame. The assigned axis values are the mean values of
      the transformed bounding box on each dropped axis. The Domain
      name of the corresponding ROI Region is stored in the Ident
      attribute of each new Frame so that later code can identify the
      corresponding ROI Region, and is also appended to the end of the
      Frame\texttt{'}s Domain. The new Frame corresponding to the first ROI
      Region found in the FrameSet is left as the current Frame on exit.

      This routine checks for matching axes in a supplied Region and
      Frame. If possible, a new region is created containing a set of
      axes that correspond in number and type (but not necessarily in
      specific attributes) to those in the supplied Frame. This means
      that AST\_CONVERT should be able to find a Mapping between the
      supplied Frame and the returned Region. Note, the order of the
      axes in the returned Region may not match those in the Frame,
      but AST\_CONVERT will be able to identify any required re-ordering.

      If it is not possible to find a matching Region (for instance, if
      there are no axes in common between the supplied Region and Frame),
      an error is reported.

      This function creates an AST Table by reading the contents of a

      of column values that are of the form \texttt{"}\# name = value\texttt{"} or
      \texttt{"}! name = value\texttt{"} are used to create Table parameters. Here \texttt{"}name\texttt{"}
      is a contiguous block of alphanumeric characters, and \texttt{"}value\texttt{"}
      represents all characters following the equals sign, up to the end
      of the line, excluding leading and trailing white space. If value
      is a scalar integer or double, it is stored as such in the Table.
      Otherwise, it is stored as a string.
