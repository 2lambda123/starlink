      INTEGER FUNCTION VAL_ITOI( BAD, ARG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     VAL_ITOI
 
*  Purpose:
*     Copy a INTEGER value.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran
 
*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = VAL_ITOI( BAD, ARG, STATUS )
 
*  Description:
*     The routine copies a value of type INTEGER.  It forms part of the
*     set of type conversion routines, but in this instance the
*     argument and result types are both the same, so the argument
*     value is simply copied.
 
*  Arguments:
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the argument value (ARG) may be "bad" (this argument
*        actually has no effect on the behaviour of this routine, but
*        is present to match the other type conversion routines).
*     ARG = INTEGER (Given)
*        The INTEGER value to be copied.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        This should be set to SAI__OK on entry, otherwise the routine
*        returns immediately with the result VAL__BADI.  This routine
*        cannot produce numerical errors, so the STATUS argument will
*        not be changed.
 
*  Returned Value:
*     VAL_ITOI = INTEGER
*        Returns the copied INTEGER value.  The value VAL__BADI will
*        be returned if STATUS is not SAI__OK on entry.

*  Check status.  Return the function result VAL__BADI if not OK.
