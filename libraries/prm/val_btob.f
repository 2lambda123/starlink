      BYTE FUNCTION VAL_BTOB( BAD, ARG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     VAL_BTOB

*  Purpose:
*     Copy a BYTE value.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = VAL_BTOB( BAD, ARG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine copies a value of type BYTE.  It forms part of the
*     set of type conversion routines, but in this instance the
*     argument and result types are both the same, so the argument
*     value is simply copied.

*  Arguments:
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the argument value (ARG) may be "bad" (this argument
*        actually has no effect on the behaviour of this routine, but
*        is present to match the other type conversion routines).
*     ARG = BYTE (Given)
*        The BYTE value to be copied.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        This should be set to SAI__OK on entry, otherwise the routine
*        returns immediately with the result VAL__BADB.  This routine
*        cannot produce numerical errors, so the STATUS argument will
*        not be changed.

*  Returned Value:
*     VAL_BTOB = BYTE
*        Returns the copied BYTE value.  The value VAL__BADB will
*        be returned if STATUS is not SAI__OK on entry.

*  Status:
      INTEGER STATUS             ! Error status

*.

*  Check status.  Return the function result VAL__BADB if not OK.
      IF( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) THEN
         VAL_BTOB = VAL__BADB

*  If OK, return the argument value.
      ELSE
         VAL_BTOB = ARG
      ENDIF

*  Exit routine.
