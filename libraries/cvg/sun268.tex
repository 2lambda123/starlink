\section {Introduction}

This library contains routines that originally formed part of the CONVERT
application package (SUN/55), but which are are of more general use and so have
been moved into a separate library.

}{

      This routine writes a standard error report for an error arising
      within a FITSIO-library routine.  The report comprises two parts.
      First there is a contextual error report.  The error number is
      translated to an error string and appended to the supplied
      message.  Thus the contextual message is of the form:
         $<$ROUTIN$>$: $<$MESSGE$>$  Error was:
      or
         $<$MESSGE$>$  Error was:
      when ROUTIN is a blank string.  After this header message, the
      FITSIO error stack is flushed.  If for some strange reason, there
      are no error messages in the stack, this routine appends the
      short translation of the error number, and if there is no
      translation, it reports the FITSIO error number and instruct the
      reader to consult the FITSIO User\texttt{'} s Guide.

      The global status is set to SAI\_\_ERROR.  This routine attempts
      to work even if the global status is bad on entry.

         A contextual error message to form part of the error report.

         FITSIO routine was made.  No punctuation is added between
         this and the \texttt{"} Error was\texttt{"}  text, so a full stop should appear

   Creates a FITS binary table from a AST FitsTable

      from an AST FitsTable. If a binary table extension with the given
      extension name already exists in the FITS file, it is replaced by

         This parameter determines what to do if the FITS file already
         contains an extension with the name given by EXTNAM. Normally,
         an error is reported, but if the extension was created by AST
         (i.e. if EXTNAM is equal to the symbolic constant AST\_\_TABEXTNAME),
         and the table version for the existing table is equal to the
         value of ASTVER, then no error is reported and this function

      parents:

         The PRVPn, PRVIn, and PRVMn keywords may often need more than
         the maximum 68 characters allowed in a keyword character value.
         Therefore this routine uses the non-standard Long-string Keyword
         Convention that permits long strings to continue over multiple
         headers.  If any of the aforementioned keywords\texttt{'}  values exceeds 68
         characters, this routine adds a warning in some COMMENT headers
         and writes a LONGSTRN header, whose value is the version of the
         convention being used.
