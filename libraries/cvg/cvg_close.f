      SUBROUTINE CVG_CLOSE( FUNIT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CVG_CLOSE

*  Purpose:
*     Closes a FITS file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CVG_CLOSE( FUNIT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This function closes the FITS files specified by the supplied
*     logical unit number. It returns without error if the supplied
*     logical unit number is currently not attached to a file.

*  Arguments:
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The logical unit number of the FITS file. Always returned equal
*        to CVG__NOLUN.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - This function attempts to run even if an error has already
*     occurred.
