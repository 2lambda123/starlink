      SUBROUTINE TRN1_NVCLS( NVIN, NVOUT, CLASS, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_NVCLS

*  Purpose:
*     combine numbers of variables with a classification.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_NVCLS( NVIN, NVOUT, CLASS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine modifies the logical classification array for a
*     uni-directional transformation to reflect additional constraints
*     imposed by the numbers of input and output variables used by the
*     transformation.
