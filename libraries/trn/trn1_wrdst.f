      SUBROUTINE TRN1_WRDST( LOCTR, DFOR, DINV, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_WRDST

*  Purpose:
*     write definition status information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_WRDST( LOCTR, DFOR, DINV, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine writes information describing the definition status
*     into the FORWARD and INVERSE components of a transformation
*     structure passed by HDS locator.  Symbolic constants are used to
*     specify the definition status values - these are defined in the
*     include file TRN_CONST. The values supplied are not validated
*     before use.
