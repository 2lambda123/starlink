      SUBROUTINE TRN_STOKD( TOKEN, VALUE, TEXT, NSUBS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TRN_STOKD

*  Purpose:
*     Substitute token with double precision value.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN_STOKD( TOKEN, VALUE, TEXT, NSUBS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches the TEXT string provided and replaces every
*     occurrence of the TOKEN sub-string with the double precision
*     value supplied, formatted as a decimal character string. To be
*     replaced, token sub-strings must be delimited by non-alphanumeric
*     characters. If they are delimited by angle brackets thus:
*     <TOKEN>, then the brackets are regarded as part of the token and
*     are also replaced. Token names must begin with an alphabetic
*     character and continue with alphanumeric characters only
*     (including underscore). They may be of any length.
*
*     The routine returns the substituted text and a count of the
*     number of token values substituted (NSUBS). If the VALUE supplied
*     is negative, its formatted value will be enclosed in parentheses.
*     This routine is not sensitive to case.

*  Arguments:
*     TOKEN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The token string.
*     VALUE = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The value to be substituted.
*     TEXT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given & Returned)
*        The text to be processed.
*     NSUBS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of token substitutions made.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*        Inherited error status.

*  Algorithm:
*     - Call CHR_DTOC to format the VALUE as a character string.
*     - Add a 'D' exponent (if necessary replacing an 'E') to indicate
*     that this is a formatted double precision value.
*     - Call TRN_STOK to make the token substitution(s), enclosing the
*     value to be substituted in parentheses if it is negative.

*  History:
*     18-AUG-1988 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     22-JUL-1992 (RFWS):
*        Fixed bug; CHR_DTOC called with a status argument which
*        doesn't exist.
*     31-MAR-1995 (RFWS):
*        Fixed problem due to change in CHR to writing 'D' exponents
*        instead of the traditional 'E'.
