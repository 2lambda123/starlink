      SUBROUTINE TRN1_UPVSN( LOCTR, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_UPVSN

*  Purpose:
*     update the software version number for a transformation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_UPVSN( LOCTR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine updates the software version number in a
*     transformation structure which has been altered.  If the
*     TRN_VERSION object has a value less than the version number of the
*     current software, then it is updated to the current value.  The
*     transformation structure is passed by HDS locator, but this is not
*     validated before use.
