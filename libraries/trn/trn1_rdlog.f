      SUBROUTINE TRN1_RDLOG( LOC, NAME, DFLT, VAL, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_RDLOG

*  Purpose:
*     read a logical value from a structure component.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_RDLOG( LOC, NAME, DFLT, VAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine reads a logical value from a scalar component of a
*     structure (type conversion will be performed if appropriate).
*     A default value is specified which applies if the component is
*     absent.
