      SUBROUTINE TRN1_RDVER( LOCTR, VERSN, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_RDVER

*  Purpose:
*     read software version number from a transformation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_RDVER( LOCTR, VERSN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine reads the software version number from the TRN_VERSION
*     object in a transformation structure passed by HDS locator.  If
*     the version number is absent, or the transformation has a version
*     above that of the current software, a STATUS value is set and an
*     error is reported.  The transformation structure itself is not
*     validated.
