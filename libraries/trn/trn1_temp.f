      SUBROUTINE TRN1_TEMP( TYPE, NDIM, DIM, LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_TEMP

*  Purpose:
*     Create temporary object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_TEMP( TYPE, NDIM, DIM, LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine is a substitute for the DAT_TEMP routine: it
*     performs the same function, but in a different manner.  It also
*     implements error reporting.

*  Algorithm:
*     The first time the routine is called, it calls DAT_TEMP to create
*     a temporary structure.  It then creates a temporary object inside
*     this structure and returns a locator to it.  On subsequent calls,
*     further temporary objects are created within the same structure,
*     with unique names generated from a counter which increments on
*     every call.  This means that all objects created by this routine
*     lie within the same HDS structure inside a temporary container
*     file.  These objects may be deleted when they have been finished
*     with (e.g. with the TRN1_ANTMP routine) without confusing HDS
*     (this happens if DAT_TEMP is used directly to create objects
*     which are subsequently deleted).

*  History:
*     24-MAR-1988:  Original version (DUVAD::RFWS)
*     13-MAY-1988:  Discovered the problems with HDS temporary objects
*        - re-wrote this routine to cope (DUVAD::RFWS)
