      SUBROUTINE TRN1_ANTMP( LOC, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_ANTMP

*  Purpose:
*     annul locator to temporary object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_ANTMP( LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine annuls an active locator associated with a temporary
*     HDS object, erasing the object in the process.  This overcomes a
*     deficiency in HDS, which leaves temporary objects in existence
*     when their locators have been annulled.  Note that this routine
*     makes no check that the object is acually temporary - it simply
*     erases it anyway.  The routine attempts to execute even if STATUS
*     is set on entry, although no error report will be made if it fails
*     under these circumstances.

*   Set the local status value and mark the error stack.

*   Find the object name from the locator supplied.

      CALL DAT_NAME( LOC, NAME, LSTAT )


*   Find the parent object from the locator supplied.
      CALL DAT_PAREN( LOC, LOCP, LSTAT )


*   Annul the original locator (this will be attempted even if the above
*   steps failed).
      CALL DAT_ANNUL( LOC, LSTAT )


*   Erase the associated object.
      CALL DAT_ERASE( LOCP, NAME, LSTAT )


*   Annul the locator to the parent object.
      CALL DAT_ANNUL( LOCP, LSTAT )


*   If an error was detected by this routine, but STATUS was set on
*   entry, then annul the error report made by this routine.
      IF( LSTAT .NE. SAI__OK ) THEN
        IF( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) THEN
          CALL ERR_ANNUL( LSTAT )


*   If STATUS was not set, allow the error report to stand and return
*   the local status value.

        ENDIF


*   End of "an error was detected by this routine" condition.

*   Release the error stack.
