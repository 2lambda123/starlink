      SUBROUTINE TRN1_WRLOG( LOC, NAME, DFLT, VAL, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_WRLOG

*  Purpose:
*     write a logical value to a structure component.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_WRLOG( LOC, NAME, DFLT, VAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine creates (if necessary) and sets a logical value for a
*     scalar component of a structure.  Any existing component with
*     the same name is over-written or erased.  A default value is
*     specified, so that if the required value equals this default,
*     then no object will actually be created.  In this case, the
*     absence of the object implies the required value.
