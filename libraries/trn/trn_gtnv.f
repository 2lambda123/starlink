      SUBROUTINE TRN_GTNV( LOCTR, NVIN, NVOUT, STATUS )







*+
*  Name:
*     TRN_GTNV

*  Purpose:
*     get numbers of variables.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN_GTNV( LOCTR, NVIN, NVOUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine obtains the numbers of input and output variables from
*     a transformation structure passed by HDS locator.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCTR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (given)
*        HDS locator to transformation structure.
*     NVIN = INTEGER (returned)
*        Number of input variables.
*     NVOUT = INTEGER (returned)
*        Number of output variables.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (given & returned)
*        Inherited error status.

*  Algorithm:
*     - Validate the transformation structure.
*     - Call TRN1_GTNV to obtain the numbers of variables information.
