      SUBROUTINE TRN1_RELSL( SLOT1, SLOT2, CTTI, CTTL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_RELSL

*  Purpose:
*     Release a series of slots in the CTT.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_RELSL( SLOT1, SLOT2, CTTI, CTTL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine releases a series of slots in the compiled
*     transformation table (CTT).  The resources used by any of the
*     slots which contain a compiled transformation are released,
*     associated temporary HDS objects are deleted and the "number of
*     modules" entry for the slot in the CTT is reset to zero. This
*     makes the slot available for re-use.  The slot numbers supplied
*     are not validated before use.  This routine attempts to execute
*     even if STATUS is set on entry, although no error report will be
*     made if it fails under these circumstances.  If more than one
*     error occurs (and STATUS is not set on entry) then a report will
*     only be made for the first error.

      IMPLICIT NONE              ! No implicit typing

*  Global Constants:
      INCLUDE 'SAE_PAR'          ! Standard SAE constants
      INCLUDE 'CNF_PAR'          ! For CNF_PVAL function
      INCLUDE 'DAT_PAR'          ! DAT_ public constants
      INCLUDE 'TRN_CONST'        ! TRN_ private constants

*  Global Variables:
      INCLUDE 'TRN_CMN'          ! TRN_ common blocks

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER SLOT1              ! First CTT slot to release
      INTEGER SLOT2              ! Last CTT slot to release

*  Arguments Given and Returned:
      INTEGER CTTI( TRN_CT_NITEM, TRN_SZCTT ) ! CTT integer array
      CHARACTER * ( * ) CTTL( TRN_SZCTT ) ! CTT locator list

*  Status:
      INTEGER STATUS             ! Error status

*  Local Variables:
      INTEGER SLOT               ! Loop counter for CTT slots
      INTEGER LSTAT              ! Local status variable

*.

*  Initialise the local status variable.
      LSTAT = STATUS

*  Process each slot in turn.
      DO SLOT = SLOT1, SLOT2

*  If the slot contains a compiled transformation, pass the compiled
*  module list (CML) locator array to TRN1_RELTS, which deletes all the
*  compiled modules in the transformation and releases the resources
*  used.
        IF( CTTI( TRN_CT_NMOD, SLOT ) .NE. 0 ) THEN
          CALL TRN1_RELTS( CTTI( TRN_CT_NMOD, SLOT ),
     :                   %VAL( CNF_PVAL( CTTI( TRN_CT_PLOCM, SLOT ) ) ),
     :                     LSTAT, %VAL( DAT__SZLOC ) )

*  Use TRN1_RELTS to delete the temporary structure holding the CML
*  (which includes the locator list just used), releasing the resources
*  used.
          CALL TRN1_RELTS( 1, CTTL( SLOT ), LSTAT )

*  Set the number of modules in the slot to zero, indicating there is
*  no transformation present.
          CTTI( TRN_CT_NMOD, SLOT ) = 0
        ENDIF
      ENDDO

*  If STATUS was not set on entry, return the local status value.
      IF( STATUS .EQ. SAI__OK ) STATUS = LSTAT

*  Exit routine.
