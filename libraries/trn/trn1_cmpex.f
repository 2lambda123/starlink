*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_CMPEX

*  Purpose:
*     Compile a transformation function expression.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_CMPEX( EXPRS, NVAR, VARNAM, MXSYMB, GCODE,
*                      MXCODE, MXCON, CODE, NCODE, CON, NCON,
*                      MXSTK, WRK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine checks and compiles an arithmetic expression
*     extracted from the right hand side of a transformation function.
*     If required, it produces a sequence of operation codes and a list
*     of numerical constants which may subsequently be used to evaluate
*     the function with the TRN1_EVEXx routines.  The operation codes
*     produced are defined in the include file TRN_CONST_STM.

*  Arguments:
*     EXPRS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The input expression to be compiled.  This must be in upper
*        case, with no embedded blanks.
*     NVAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of variable names defined for use in the
*        expression.
*     VARNAM( NVAR ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A list of the variable names.  These must be in upper case,
*        with no embedded blanks.
*     MXSYMB = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of symbols which may appear in the
*        expression.  This value specifies the size of the workspace
*        array WRK.  The only safe upper limit is the number of (non-
*        blank) characters in the input expression.
*     GCODE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the compilation is to produce a list of operation
*        codes and constants (or whether it is simply to check the
*        syntax and calculate the number of code and constant items
*        which will be produced).  If GCODE is .FALSE., the CODE, CON
*        and MXSTK arguments are not used.
*     MXCODE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the CODE array.  The size required cannot be
*        larger than MXSYMB, but may be considerably smaller.  A
*        definite value can be obtained by calling the routine with
*        GCODE set to .FALSE. and using the value returned for NCODE.
*     MXCON = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the CON array.  The size required cannot be larger
*        than MXSYMB, but may be considerably smaller.  A definite
*        value can be obtained by calling the routine with GCODE set to
*        .FALSE. and using the value returned for NCON.
*     CODE( MXCODE ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        On successful exit, if GCODE is .TRUE., this array contains a
*        list of the operation codes produced.  The first item in the
*        list is a count of the number which follow.
*     NCODE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The total number of items returned in the CODE array
*        (including the initial item).  If GCODE is .FALSE., the same
*        value is still returned, although no items will actually be
*        placed into the CODE array.
*     CON( MXCON ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        On successful exit, if GCODE is .TRUE., this array contains a
*        list of the constants produced.  This list includes all the
*        constants explicitly appearing in the input expression, in
*        left-right order.  It also includes identification numbers for
*        all the variables identified (at the position where they occur
*        in the expression) and counts of the number of arguments
*        supplied for built-in functions which accept a variable number
*        of arguments.  The position of the latter "constants" is
*        determined by the position of the closing parenthesis which
*        terminates the function call.
*     NCON = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The total number of values returned in the CON array.  If
*        GCODE is .FALSE., the same number is still returned, although
*        no values will actually be placed into the CON array.
*     MXSTK = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The maximum size of the arithmetic stack required to evaluate
*        the expression.  This value may be used to allocate workspace
*        for the TRN1_EVEXx routines.  No value is returned unless
*        GCODE is .TRUE.
*     WRK( MXSYMB, 3 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A workspace array.  See the description of the MXSYMB argument
*        for how to determine its size.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*        Standard error status argument.

*  Algorithm:
*     The routine passes through the input expression searching for
*     "symbols".  It looks for "standard" symbols (arithmetic
*     operators, parentheses, function calls and delimiters) in the
*     next part of the expression to be parsed, using identification
*     information stored in the symbol data table, which is accessed
*     via common blocks.  It ignores certain symbols, according to
*     whether they appear to be "operators" or "operands".  The choice
*     depends on what the previous symbol was; for instance, two
*     operators may not occur in succession.  Unary (+ and -) operators
*     are also ignored in situations where they are not permitted.

*     If a standard symbol is found, it is passed to the routine
*     TRN1_VSYMB, which keeps track of the current level of parenthesis
*     in the expression and of the number of arguments supplied to any
*     outstanding (possibly nested) function calls.  This routine then
*     accepts or rejects the symbol according to whether it is valid
*     within the current context.  An error is reported if it is
*     rejected.

*     If the part of the expression currently being parsed did not
*     contain a "standard" symbol, an attempt is made to parse it first
*     as a constant, then as a variable name.  If either of these
*     succeeds, an appropriate symbol number is added to the list of
*     symbols identified so far, and a value is added to the list of
*     constants - this is either the value of the constant itself, or
*     the identification number of the variable.  If the expression
*     cannot be parsed, an error is reported.

*     When the entire expression has been analysed as a sequence of
*     symbols (and associated constants), the routine TRN1_EVSRT is
*     called.  This sorts the symbols into "evaluation order", which is
*     the order in which the associated operations must be performed on
*     a push-down arithmetic stack to evaluate the expression.  This
*     routine also substitutes operation codes (defined in the include
*     file TRN_CONST_STM) for the symbol numbers and calculates the
*     maximum size of evaluation stack which will be required.
