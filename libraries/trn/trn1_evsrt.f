      SUBROUTINE TRN1_EVSRT( GCODE, MXSYMB, MXCODE, MXCON, CON, NSYMB,

*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_EVSRT

*  Purpose:
*     perform an evaluation order sort on expression symbols.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_EVSRT( GCODE, MXSYMB, MXCODE, MXCON, CON, NSYMB,
*                      SYMLST, CODE, NCODE, MXSTK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine sorts a sequence of numbers representing symbols
*     identified in a transformation function expression.  The symbols
*     (i.e. the expression syntax) must have been fully validated before
*     calling this routine, as no validation is performed here.
*        The symbols are sorted into the order in which corresponding
*     operations must be performed on a push-down arithmetic stack in
*     order to evaluate the expression.  Operation codes (defined in
*     the include file TRN_CONST_STM) are then substituted for the
*     symbol numbers.
