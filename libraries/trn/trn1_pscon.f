      SUBROUTINE TRN1_PSCON( EXPRS, ISTART, CONST, IEND, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_PSCON

*  Purpose:
*     parse a constant.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_PSCON( EXPRS, ISTART, CONST, IEND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine parses an expression, looking for a constant starting
*     at the character position ISTART in the expression EXPRS.  If the
*     routine identifies the constant successfully, CONST will return
*     its value and IEND will be set to the position of the final
*     constant character in EXPRS
*
*     If the characters encountered are clearly not part of a constant
*     (it does not begin with a numeral or decimal point) the routine
*     returns with CONST and IEND set to zero, but without setting
*     STATUS.  However, if the first character appears to be a constant
*     but its syntax proves to be invalid, then STATUS is also set and
*     an error is reported.
*
*     This routine is not sensitive to case.  The constant must not
*     have a sign (+ or -) in front of it.

*  History:
*     28-MAR-1988 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     1-JUN-1988 (RFWS):
*        Changed argument list to match TRN1_PSVAR.
*     8-JUN-1988 (RFWS):
*        Considerably revised to improve detection of bad
*        constant syntax which CHR_CTOD does not detect.
*     13-FEB-1992 (RFWS):
*        Improved error reporting.
