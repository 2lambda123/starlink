      SUBROUTINE TRN1_GETSL( CTTI, SLOT, IDT, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_GETSL

*  Purpose:
*     get a free slot in the compiled transformation table.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_GETSL( CTTI, SLOT, IDT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches the compiled transformation table (CTT) for a
*     slot which does not yet contain a compiled transformation.  If one
*     is found, the slot number is returned and an associated
*     transformation ID is issued. If no free slot is present, a slot
*     number and ID of zero are returned.

*   Check status.

*   Search for the first slot with no modules recorded.

*   Check the slot number does not exceed the maximum number of compiled
*   transformations allowed and report an error if it does (this check
*   is required to prevent duplicate IDs being issued, but it should
*   never be encountered as the number of compiled transformations
*   allowed is very large).

*   If a slot was found, set the associated compiled transformation ID.
*   This is calculated from the slot number and the value IDCODE.  This
*   latter value is set to the number of IDs issued so far (TRN_IDCNT,
*   stored in the common block), except that it cycles to prevent
*   overflow when calculating the IDT value. This arrangement prevents
*   old (annulled) ID values being re-used (for a very long time, at
*   least), so that ID values may be regarded as unique.
      ELSE
        IDCODE = MOD( TRN_IDCNT, ( NUM__MAXI / TRN__MXCTR ) )
        IDT = SLOT + ( TRN__MXCTR * IDCODE )


*   Store the ID as a check count in the CTT and increment the count of
*   IDs issued.
        CTTI( TRN_CT_CHECK, SLOT ) = IDT
        TRN_IDCNT = TRN_IDCNT + 1
      ENDIF


*   Exit routine.
