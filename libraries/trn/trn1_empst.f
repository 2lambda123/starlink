      SUBROUTINE TRN1_EMPST( STR, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_EMPST

*  Purpose:
*     empty a structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_EMPST( STR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine empties an HDS structure by erasing all its
*     components.  The routine attempts to execute even if STATUS is set
*     on entry, although no error report will be made if it fails under
*     these circumstances.  If more than one error is detected by this
*     routine (and STATUS was not set on entry), then a report will
*     only be made for the first error.
