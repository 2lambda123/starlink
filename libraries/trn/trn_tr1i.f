      SUBROUTINE TRN_TR1I( BAD, NX, XIN, IDT, XOUT, STATUS )







*+
*  Name:
*     TRN_TR1I

*  Purpose:
*     transform 1-dimensional INTEGER data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN_TR1I( BAD, NX, XIN, IDT, XOUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine applies a compiled transformation to a set of
*     1-dimensional data points supplied as a single (X) array of
*     INTEGER coordinate values.

*  Arguments:
*     BAD = LOGICAL (given)
*        Whether the input coordinates may be "bad".
*     NX = INTEGER (given)
*        The number of data points to transform.
*     XIN( NX ) = INTEGER (given)
*        Input X coordinate values for the data points.
*     IDT = INTEGER (given)
*        ID for the compiled transformation to be applied.
*     XOUT( NX ) = INTEGER (returned)
*        Array to receive the transformed coordinate values.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (given & returned)
*        Inherited error status.

*  Algorithm:
*     - Call TRN_TRNI to perform the transformation.
