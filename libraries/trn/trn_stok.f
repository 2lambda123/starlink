      SUBROUTINE TRN_STOK( TOKEN, VALUE, TEXT, NSUBS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TRN_STOK

*  Purpose:
*     Substitute token.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN_STOK( TOKEN, VALUE, TEXT, NSUBS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches the TEXT string provided and replaces every
*     occurrence of the TOKEN sub-string with the contents of the VALUE
*     string.  Leading and trailing blanks in the VALUE string are
*     disregarded.  The substitution is not recursive.  Token
*     sub-strings in TEXT must be delimited by non-alphanumeric
*     characters.  If they are delimited by angle brackets thus:
*     <TOKEN>, then the brackets are regarded as part of the token and
*     are also replaced.
*
*     Token names must begin with an alphabetic character and continue
*     with alphanumeric characters (including '_') only.  They may be
*     of any length.  The routine returns the substituted text and a
*     count of the number of token values substituted (NSUBS).  This
*     routine is not sensitive to case.

*  Arguments:
*     TOKEN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The token string.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The value string to be substituted.
*     TEXT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given & Returned)
*        The text to be processed.
*     NSUBS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of token substitutions made.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*        Inherited error status.

*  Algorithm:
*     - Initialise, then validate the TOKEN string.
*     - Find the lengths of the TOKEN and TEXT strings and the limits of
*       the VALUE string.
*     - Obtain upper- and lower-case versions of the initial TOKEN
*       character.
*     - Search through the TEXT string, finding possible occurrences of
*       the TOKEN string by looking for the first token character
*       (regardless of case).
*     - Check if an occurrence has been found by matching the
*       appropriate TEXT characters with the TOKEN string and checking
*       that the previous and following characters (if they exist) are
*       non-alphanumeric.
*     - Note if the previous and following characters are angle
*       brackets.
*     - If the token occurrence is delimited by angle brackets, increase
*       the region being considered to include them.
*     - Decide if the text which will replace the token is larger or
*       smaller in extent than the token occurrence and move the
*       following text to the right or left as appropriate.
*     - Substitute the VALUE string for the token occurrence.
*     - Update the TEXT string length and report an error if it is too
*       long (indicating that text has been truncated at the right).
*     - Update the start position for finding the next token occurrence
*       and continue the search for tokens until the TEXT string is
*       exhausted.
