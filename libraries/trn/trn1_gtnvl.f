*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_GTNVL

*  Purpose:
*     get numbers of variables from a compiled module list.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_GTNVL( NMOD, NVAR, NVIN, NVOUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine returns the number of input and output variables from
