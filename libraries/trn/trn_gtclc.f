      SUBROUTINE TRN_GTCLC( IDT, CLASS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TRN_GTCLC

*  Purpose:
*     get compiled classification.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     TRN_GTCLC( IDT, CLASS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine obtains the logical classification array associated
*     with a compiled transformation.

*  Arguments:
*     IDT = INTEGER (given)
*        Identifier for the compiled transformation.
*     CLASS( TRN__MXCLS ) = LOGICAL (returned)
*        Logical classification array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (given & returned)
*        Inherited error status.

*  Algorithm:
*     - Ensure that the TRANSFORM facility is active.
*     - Obtain the compiled transformation table (CTT) slot number from
*       the identifier supplied, validating the identifier in the
*       process.
*     - Extract the classification information from the appropriate slot
*       in the CTT classification array list.
