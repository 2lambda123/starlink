      SUBROUTINE TRN1_SETUP( START, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_SETUP

*  Purpose:
*     Set up (and close down) the TRANSFORM facility.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_SETUP( START, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine ensures the TRANSFORM facility is either active or
*     inactive by performing a startup or closedown sequence according
*     to the setting of the logical argument START.  If the facility is
*     already in the desired state, no action is taken.  If a closedown
*     sequence is specified (START=.FALSE.) the routine will attempt to
*     execute even if STATUS is set on entry, although no error report
*     will be made if it fails under these circumstances.

*   If performing a startup sequence...
*   --------------------------------
      IF( START ) THEN


*   Check the facility is inactive.
        IF( .NOT. ACTIVE ) THEN


*   Check status.
          IF( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN


*   Initialise the CTT size to zero in the common block.
          TRN_SZCTT = 0


*   Extend the CTT (this causes it to be created with an initial size
*   allocation which is entered into the common block).
          CALL TRN1_EXCTT( STATUS )


*   Allocate workspace for use in transforming data points.  The number
*   of elements allocated of each data type is specified by the constant
*   TRN__NWRK in the include file TRN_CONST.  A locator to the workspace
*   structure and pointers to the mapped workspace arrays are stored in
*   the common blocks.
          CALL TRN1_ALWRK( TRN__NWRK, TRN_PWRKI, TRN_PWRKR, TRN_PWRKD,
     :                     TRN_LWRK, STATUS )


*   If there is no error, flag the system as active and set the count
*   of transformation IDs issued in the common block.
          IF( STATUS .EQ. SAI__OK ) THEN
            ACTIVE = .TRUE.
            TRN_IDCNT = IDCNT
          ENDIF


*   End of "the system is inactive" condition.
        ENDIF



*   If performing a closedown sequence...
*   ----------------------------------
      ELSE


*   Check the system is active.
        IF( ACTIVE ) THEN


*   Initialise the local status variable.
          LSTAT = STATUS


*   If the CTT exists (its size in not zero), release the resources
*   associated with all the slots in the CTT.
          IF( TRN_SZCTT .NE. 0 ) THEN
            CALL TRN1_RELSL( 1, TRN_SZCTT,
     :                       %VAL( CNF_PVAL( TRN_PCTTI ) ),

*   Release the top level temporary structure containing the CTT,
*   freeing the resources used by it.
            CALL TRN1_RELTS( 1, TRN_LCTT, LSTAT )
          ENDIF


*   Release the workspace allocated at startup.
          CALL TRN1_RELTS( 1, TRN_LWRK, STATUS )


*   Remember the number of transformation IDs issued (this is not reset
*   at closedown, so the count continues at the next startup).
          IDCNT = TRN_IDCNT


*   Flag the system as inactive.
          ACTIVE = .FALSE.


*   If STATUS was not set on entry, return the local status value.
          IF( STATUS .EQ. SAI__OK ) STATUS = LSTAT


*   End of "the system is active" condition.
