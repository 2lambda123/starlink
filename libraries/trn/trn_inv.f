      SUBROUTINE TRN_INV( LOCTR, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN_INV

*  Purpose:
*     invert transformation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN_INV( LOCTR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine inverts a transformation structure passed by HDS
*     locator.  The inversion process interchanges the forward and
*     inverse transformation definitions.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCTR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (given)
*        HDS locator to the transformation structure - the structure
*        is modified by this routine.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (given & returned)
*        Inherited error status.

*  Algorithm:
*     - Validate the transformation structure.
*     - Locate the structure's MODULE_ARRAY component.
*     - If necessary, extend the size of this array by one to provide
*       some workspace.
*     - Reverse the order of the array elements by interchanging them in
*       pairs.
*     - After interchanging each pair, invert the transformation module
*       which each element contains.
*     - Restore the MODULE_ARRAY to its original size.
*     - If the number of modules was odd, invert the remaining central
*       one.
*     - Reverse the transformation structure's definition status
*       information.
*     - Update the software version number.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     - The routine runs less efficiently than is desirable.  This is
*       largely due to the relatively high cost of moving the contents
*       of one HDS structure into another.  The performance would
*       probably improve if HDS provided a routine to do this.
