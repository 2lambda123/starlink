      SUBROUTINE TRN1_CSWAP( LOC, NAME1, NAME2, STATUS )








*+
*  Name:
*     TRN1_CSWAP

*  Purpose:
*     swap component names in a structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN1_CSWAP( LOC, NAME1, NAME2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine interchanges the names of two components of a
*     structure (NAME1 and NAME2).  The routine operates even if one
*     component is absent, in which case it simply changes the name of
*     the one which does exist.  If neither component exists, the
*     routine returns without action.
