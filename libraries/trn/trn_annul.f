      SUBROUTINE TRN_ANNUL( IDT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TRN_ANNUL

*  Purpose:
*     Annul compiled transformation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRN_ANNUL( IDT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine annuls the compiled transform associated with the
*     identifier supplied.  Resources associated with the compiled
*     transformation are released and the identifier is reset to
*     TRN__NOID.  This routine attempts to execute even if STATUS is
*     set on entry, although no error report will be made if it fails
*     under these circumstances.

*  Arguments:
*     IDT = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*        Compiled transformation ID to be annulled.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*        Inherited error status.

*  Algorithm:
*     - Mark the error stack.
*     - Ensure the TRANSFORM facility is active.
*     - Find the compiled transformation table (CTT) slot number
*       associated with the IDT value supplied.
*     - Release the CTT slot.
*     - Reset the IDT value to TRN__NOID.
*     - If an error occurred, decide whether an error report is
*       required.  If not, then annul it.
*     - Release the error stack.
