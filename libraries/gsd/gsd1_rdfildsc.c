 * Name:
 *    gsd1_rdfildsc

 * Purpose:
 *    Read GSD file descriptor.

 * Language:
 *    ANSI C

 * Type of Module:
 *    C function.

 * Prototype:
 *    (available via #include "gsd1.h")
 *    int gsd1_rdfildsc( FILE *fptr, struct file_descriptor *file_dsc );

 * Description:
 *    Routine to read file descriptor from GSD file and store result
 *    in file descriptor structure.

 * Arguments:
 *    FILE *fptr (Given)
 *       C file descriptor.
 *    struct file_descriptor *file_dsc (Returned)
 *       GSD header file descriptor.

 * Returned value:
 *    int gsd_rdfildsc();
 *       -1 if the fread failed, i.e. if there were not enough bytes left in
 *       the file. Zero otherwise. A return value of zero does not guarantee
 *       that anything useful was read from the file, say whether it is a GSD
 *       file at all.

 * Implementation Status:
 *    This routine looks at how many bytes this C implementation needs for the
 *    structure that is a GSD file descriptor. It then reads that many bytes in
 *    one chunk with fread. Unless fread is very clever, problems may arise
 *    when the struct contains padding bytes. There will also be a problem if
 *    in the file there are padding bytes that this C implementation would not
 *    want in the struct.
 *
 *    This could be fixed by reading each struct member with its own fread.

 *    02 Dec 1994 (hme):
 *       Split off gsd.c. ANSI C. Do not null-terminate string within
 *       structure.
 *    08 Dec 1994 (hme):
 *       Use gsd2_nativx routines.
 *    04 Jul 2008 (timj):
 *       use size_t rather than casting
