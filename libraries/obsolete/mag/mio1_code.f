      SUBROUTINE MIO1_CODE(CODE, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     MIO1_CODE

*  Purpose:
*     In Unix this is a dummy routine which copies its input to its output.
*     Its sole purpose is to make applications built using MIO to work
*     on VMS and Unix systems.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MIO1_CODE(CODE, STATUS)

*  Description:
*     In Unix it simply sets STATUS = CODE

*  Arguments:
*     CODE=INTEGER (Given)
*        The input status.
*     STATUS=INTEGER (Returned)
*        The returned corresponding MIO status code.
