      SUBROUTINE MIO_ACTIV(STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     MIO_ACTIV

*  Purpose:
*     initialise MIO system.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MIO_ACTIV(STATUS)

*  Description:
*     The MIO system is initialised.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS=INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Variable holding the status value.   If this variable is not
*        SAI__OK on input, then the routine will return without action.  If
*        the routine fails to complete, this variable will be set to an
*        appropriate error number.

*  Algorithm:
*     The MIO error codes are given to SEM and the MIO common blocks are
*     initialised.
