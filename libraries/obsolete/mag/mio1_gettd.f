      SUBROUTINE MIO1_GETTD(TD, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     MIO1_GETTD

*  Purpose:
*     get a tape descriptor.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MIO_GETTD(TD, STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Get the next available tape descriptor.

*  Arguments:
*     TD=INTEGER (Returned)
*        A variable to contain the tape descriptor.
*     STATUS=INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Variable holding the status value.   If this variable is not
*        SAI__OK on input, then the routine will return without action.  If
*        the routine fails to complete, this variable will be set to an
*        appropriate error number.
*        N.B. This routine does not report its own errors.

*  Algorithm:
*     Search the table of tape descriptors for one that is not being used.
