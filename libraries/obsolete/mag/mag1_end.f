*     MAG1_END

*  Purpose:
*     Close down MAG.

*  Description:
*     Close all open files.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS=INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Variable holding the status value.   If the routine fails to
*        complete, this variable will be set to an appropriate error number.
*        If this variable is not SAI__OK on input, then the routine will
*        still attempt to execute, but will return with STATUS set to the
