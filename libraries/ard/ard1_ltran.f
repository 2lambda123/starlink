      SUBROUTINE ARD1_LTRAN( NDIM, C, NP, IN, OUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_LTRAN

*  Purpose:
*     Apply an n-D linear mapping to a set of co-ordinates

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_LTRAN( NDIM, C, NP, IN, OUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied co-efficients are used to transform the co-ordinates
*     given by IN, and the results are returned in OUT. The mapping is:
*
*     OUT(1) = C(1)      +C(2)*IN(1)    +C(3)*IN(2)...     +C(N+1)*IN(N)
*     OUT(2) = C(N+2)  +C(N+3)*IN(1)  +C(N+4)*IN(2)...   +C(2*N+2)*IN(N)
*      ...
*     OUT(N) = C(N*N)+C(N*N+1)*IN(1)+C(N*N+2)*IN(2)... +C(N*(N+1))*IN(N)

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The no. of dimensions
*     C( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Co-efficients. There should be NDIM*(NDIM+1) of them. This is not
*        checked.
*     NP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The no. of points.
*     IN( NDIM, NP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The input co-ordinates.
*     OUT( NDIM, NP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The output co-ordinates. This can be the same as IN.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
