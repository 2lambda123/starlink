      SUBROUTINE ARD_WCS( IWCS, DOMAIN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD_WCS

*  Purpose:
*     Specify WCS information to be used in future calls to ARD_WORK.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD_WCS( IWCS, DOMAIN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine can be used to specify the cooordinate systems
*     which can be used in subsequent calls to ARD_WORK. ARD descriptions
*     passed to subsequent calls to ARD_WORK can include positions in any
*     of the Frames included in the supplied FrameSet. The ARD description
*     should include suitable COFRAME or WCS statements to indicate which
*     coordinate system is being used. If no COFRAME or WCS statements
*     are included in the ARD description, then it is assumed that
*     positions within the ARD description are given in the current Frame 
*     of the supplied FrameSet, IWCS.
*   
*     If this routine is not called prior to ARD_WORK (or if it is
*     called with IWCS set AST__NULL), then the ARD description must
*     provide (either directly or through a WCS statement) positions in 
*     pixel coordinates.
*
*     The FrameSet pointer supplied is simply stored by this routine.
*     If any changes are subsequently made to the FrameSet by the calling 
*     routine, then these changes will be visible within ARD_WORK. In 
*     particular, if the calling routine annulls the FrameSet pointer, 
*     then ARD_WORK will fail.
*
*     The supplied FrameSet will be used by all subsequent calls to ARD_WORK 
*     until a new FrameSet is specified by calling ARD_WCS again. 

*  Arguments:
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to a FrameSet, or AST__NULL.
*     DOMAIN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The Domain name corresponding to pixel co-ordinates within the
*        mask array passed to routine ARD_WORK. If a blank value is
*        supplied, "PIXEL" will be used. The IWCS FrameSet (if supplied) 
*        must contain a Frame with this Domain. If the supplied string is 
*        longer than 40 characters, the trailing characters are ignored. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
