      SUBROUTINE ARD1_TRCON(NDIM, C1, C2, D, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_TRCON

*  Purpose:
*     Concatenate two N-dimensional linear mappings

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_TRCON(NDIM, C1, C2, D, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The co-efficients of a linear mapping are returned in D which
*     represents the total mapping obtained by applying the mapping
*     given by C1 followed by the mapping given by C2.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions.
*     C1( 0:NDIM, NDIM ) = REAL (Given)
*        The co-efficients of the first linear mapping. Column zero
*        holds the offset vector.
*     C2( 0:NDIM, NDIM ) = REAL (Given)
*        The co-efficients of the second linear mapping. 
*     D( 0:NDIM, NDIM ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The co-efficients of the resulting linear mapping.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
