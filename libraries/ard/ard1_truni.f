      SUBROUTINE ARD1_TRUNI( NDIM, C, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_TRUNI

*  Purpose:
*     Store a unit linear transformation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_TRUNI( NDIM, C, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The co-efficients of a unit linear mapping are stored in the
*     supplied array.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensionality of the co-ordinate system.
*     C( * ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The co-efficients of the unit linear mapping. The array should
*        hold NDIM*( NDIM + 1 ) values.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

      END DO
