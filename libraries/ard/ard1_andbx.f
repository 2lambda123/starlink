*  Name:
*     ARD1_ANDBX

*  Purpose:
*     Find the intersection of two boxes.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_ANDBX( NDIM, LBND1, UBND1, LBND2, UBND2, LB, UB,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The intersection region of the two supplied boxes is found.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The no. of dimensions.
*     LBND1( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bounds of the first box. A value of VAL__MAXI for the
*        first element indicates an infinite sized box, and a value of
*        VAL__MINI indicates a zero sized box.
*     UBND1( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bounds of the first box. 
*     LBND2( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bounds of the second box. A value of VAL__MAXI for
*        the first element indicates an infinite sized box, and a value
*        of VAL__MINI indicates a zero sized box. 
*     UBND2( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bounds of the first box. 
*     LB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The lower bounds of the intersection of the two supplied boxes.
*     UB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The upper bounds of the intersection of the two supplied boxes.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
