*  Name:
*     ARD1_UINTERP

*  Purpose:
*     Perform sub-pixel interpolation on a grid of data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_UINTERP( NDIM_IN, LBND_IN, UBND_IN, IN, IN_VAR,
*                        NPOINT, OFFSET, COORDS, PARAMS, FLAGS, BADVAL,
*                        OUT, OUT_VAR, NBAD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine is passed via the FINTERP argument of the 
*     AST_RESAMPLEI function in order to perform sub-pixel interpolation
*     during resampling of gridded data.
*
*     For each output (mask) pixel, an interior value is returned if
*     the the corresponding position in user coords is within the current
*     ARD region. Otherwise an exterior value is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM_IN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid.
*     LBND_IN( NDIM_IN ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bounds of the input grid.
*     UBND_IN( NDIM_IN ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bounds of the input grid.
*     IN( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The input grid. This array is not actually used since the output
*        value depends on its position alone. The bounds of this array
*        can be supplied all equal to 1.
*     IN_VAR( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Not used.
*     NPOINT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of points at which the input grid is to be
*        interpolated. This will be at least one.
*     OFFSET( NPOINT ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        For each interpolation point, this array will contain the
*        offset from the start of the OUT array at which the interpolated 
*        value should be stored. For example, the interpolated value for
*        point number POINT should be stored in OUT(1+OFFSET(POINT)).
*     COORDS( NPOINT, NDIM_IN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        A 2-dimensional array containing the coordinates of the
*        points at which interpolation should be performed. These will
*        be stored so that coordinate number COORD for interpolation
*        point number POINT is found in element COORDS(POINT,COORD).
*
*        If any interpolation point has any of its coordinates equal
*        to the value AST__BAD (as defined in the AST_PAR include
*        file), then the corresponding output data (and variance)
*        should be set to the value given by BADVAL (see below).
*     PARAMS( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The parameters defining the region.
*     FLAGS = INTEGER (Given)
*        This will be the same value as was given via the FLAGS
*        argument of AST_RESAMPLE<X>. You may test this value to
*        provide additional control over the operation of your
*        resampling algorithm. Note that the special flag values
*        AST__URESAMP1, 2, 3 & 4 are reserved for you to use for your
*        own purposes and will not clash with other pre-defined flag
*        values (see AST_RESAMPLE<X>).
*     BADVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        This will be the same value as was given for the BADVAL
*        argument of AST_RESAMPLE<X>. It should be used for identifying 
*        bad output values in the OUT array.
*     OUT( * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An array into which the interpolated data values should be
*        returned.  Note that details of the storage order and number
*        of dimensions of this array are not required, since the
*        OFFSET array contains all necessary information about where
*        each returned value should be stored.
*
*        In general, not all elements of this array may be used in any 
*        particular invocation of the routine. Those which are not used 
*        should be returned unchanged.
*     OUT_VAR( * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Not used.
*     NBAD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        This should return the number of interpolation points at
*        which an output data value equal to BADVAL has been assigned 
*        because no valid interpolated value could be obtained.  The maximum
*        value that should be returned is NPOINT, and the minimum is
*        zero (indicating that all output values were successfully
*        obtained).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - This routine will typically be invoked more than once for each
*     invocation of AST_RESAMPLEI.
*     - If an error occurs within this routine, it should set the
*     STATUS argument to an error value before returning. This will
*     cause an immediate return from AST_RESAMPLEI. The error value
*     AST__UINER is available for this purpose, but other values may also
*     be used (e.g. if you wish to distinguish different types of error).
*     The AST__UINER error value is defined in the AST_ERR include file.
