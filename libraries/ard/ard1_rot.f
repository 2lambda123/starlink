*  Name:
*     ARD1_ROT

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise an array to hold a ROTBOX region.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_ROT( FRM, RINDEX, LBND1, UBND1, LBND2, UBND2, NPAR, D, PAR,
*                    B, LBEXTB, UBEXTB, LBINTB, UBINTB, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied parameters are modified so that they look the same
*     as those for a POLYGON region. ARD1_POL is then called to load the
*     region.
*
*     A polygon vertex is put at the middle of each side in case we are 
*     dealing with spherical coords, in which case a polygon edge greater 
*     than 180 arc-degrees could cause problems.

*  Arguments:
*     FRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to the user coord Frame.
*     RINDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value to use to represent interior points.
*     LBND1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of the B array on the first axis.
*     UBND1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of the B array on the first axis.
*     LBND2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of the B array on the second axis.
*     UBND2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of the B array on the second axis.
*     NPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the PAR array.
*     D( 6 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The coefficients of the user->pixel mapping. The mapping is:
*        P1 = D0 + D1*U1 + D2*U2 
*        P2 = D3 + D4*U1 + D5*U2 
*     PAR( NPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Region parameters. 
*     B( LBND1:UBND1, LBND2:UBND2 ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The array.
*     LBEXTB( 2 ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        returned to indicate an "infinite" box. Other elements should
*        be ignored.
*     UBEXTB( 2 ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. The returned values should be ignored
*        since the box is "infinite".
*     LBINTB( 2 ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBINTB( 2 ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
