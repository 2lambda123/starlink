      SUBROUTINE ARD1_SRCTA( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_SRCTA

*  Purpose:
*     Read AST_ data as text from a GRP group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_SRCTA( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This is a service routine to be provided as a "source" routine
*     for the AST_CHANNEL function. It reads data from a GRP group
*     (in response to reading from an AST_ Channel) and delivers it to
*     the AST_ library for interpretation.
*
*     This routine has only a STATUS argument, so it communicates with
*     other ARD routines via global variables stored in the ARD_AST common 
*     blocks. These are described below under "Global Variables used as 
*     Arguments".

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Global Variables used as Arguments:
*     CMN_IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the group which holds the data. 
*     CMN_NXTLN = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        This must initially be set to the value 1, to indicate that
*        data will be read starting at the first element of the group
*        (note the routine will not operate correctly unless 1 is
*        the initial value - you cannot start reading at another point
*        in the group if you have previously read from a different
*        group). On exit it will be incremented by the number of
*        elements used to obtain data, so that it identifies the first
*        element to be used on the next invocation.

*  Check inherited global status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  Before reading the first line, obtain the number of elements in the
*  group being read from.
      IF ( CMN_NXTLN .EQ. 1 ) CALL GRP_GRPSZ( CMN_IGRP, DIM, STATUS )

*  If any elements are left in the group, get the next one.
      IF ( CMN_NXTLN .LE. DIM ) THEN
         CALL ARD1_GET( CMN_IGRP, CMN_NXTLN, 1, TEXT, STATUS )

*  Store its used length.
         L = CHR_LEN( TEXT )

*  Increment the index of the next element to read.
         CMN_NXTLN = CMN_NXTLN + 1

*  If no elements are left to read, set L to -1 to indicate this.
      ELSE
         L = -1
      END IF

*  If there has been an error, set the number of characters to -1
*  to indicate no more data. 
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) L = -1

*  Send the text to the AST_ library for interpretation.
