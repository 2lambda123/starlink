*  Name:
*     ARD1_COPYD

*  Purpose:
*     Copy double precision values from one array to another.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:

*        The number of values to copy.
*     IN( N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The input values.
*     OUT( N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The output values.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
