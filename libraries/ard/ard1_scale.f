      SUBROUTINE ARD1_SCALE( FRM, P, DIST, AXIS, SDIST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_SCALE

*  Purpose:
*     Convert a distance given by the user into the equivalent distance
*     along a specified axis.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_SCALE( FRM, P, DIST, AXIS, SDIST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Distances supplied as arguments within keywords are usually given as 
*     increments along axis 1 (unless the user coord Frame is a SkyFrame,
*     in which case they are given as increments along the latitude axis).
*     This routine converts a given increment to the equivalent increment
*     measured along a specified axis (which may not be the one along
*     which the increment was originaly specified). For instance, you can
*     use this routine to find the RA increment corresponding to a given
*     arc-distance, at a given position on the sky.

*  Arguments:
*     FRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to a Frame describing user coordinates.
*     P( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The position within FRM at which the increment is to be converted.
*     DIST = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        An increment along the axis used to measure distances within FRM
*        (as identified by ARD1_DSTAX).
*     AXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the axis along which the equivalent increment is 
*        required.
*     SDIST = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The equivalent increment along axis AXIS.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
