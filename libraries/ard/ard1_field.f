      SUBROUTINE ARD1_FIELD( ELEM, L, START, KEYW, OPER, STAT, TYPE,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_FIELD

*  Purpose:
*     Identify the next field in an ARD expression

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_FIELD( ELEM, L, START, KEYW, OPER, STAT, TYPE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The symbols for each type of field are compared in turn with the
*     start of the supplied element. If more than ARD__SZABB characters
*     match, then the field is identified (unless the field is an
*     operator in which case no abbreviation is allowed).

*  Arguments:
*     ELEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The current element of the ARD description.
*     L = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the last non-blank character in ELEM.
*     START = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The index of the next character to be checked in ELEM.
*        Updated by this routine.
*     KEYW = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        .TRUE. if the next field is a keyword field.
*     OPER = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        .TRUE. if the next field is an operator field.
*     STAT = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        .TRUE. if the next field is a statement field.
*     TYPE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The integer value used to identify the current field type
*        (defined in include file ARD_CONST).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
