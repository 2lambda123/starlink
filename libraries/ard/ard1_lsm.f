*  Name:
*     ARD1_LSM

*  Purpose:
*     Load the supplied mask onto the stack.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_LSM( NDIM, LBND, UBND, MSKSIZ, MASK, DONE, B, LBEXTB,
*                    UBEXTB, LBINTB, UBINTB, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The values in the supplied mask are copied into array B. The
*     interior and exterior bounding boxes of the supplied mask are
*     found and returned so long as they have not already been found.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in each array.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of each array.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of each array.
*     MSKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The total number of elements in each array.
*     MASK( MSKSIZ ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The supplied mask (in vector form). This should hold zero for
*        all exterior points, and a positive value for all interior
*        points. 
*     DONE = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        If DONE is supplied .FALSE., then the bounding boxes of the
*        mask are found and returned in the arrays LBEXTB, UBEXTB,
*        LBINTB, UBINTB. If DONE is supplied .TRUE., then the contents
*        of the above arrays are left unchanged. DONE is always returned
*        .TRUE..
*     B( MSKSIZ ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The stack array (in vector form). This is used as the first 
*        operand in the ARD expression. If INDEX is non-zero, it will
*        be returned holding a copy of the supplied mask, and will be 
*        returned holding zeros otherwise.
*     LBEXTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box (in practice, a box equal to
*        the size of the mask), and a value of VAL__MINI for element 1
*        is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBEXTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. 
*     LBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
