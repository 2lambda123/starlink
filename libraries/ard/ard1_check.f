      SUBROUTINE ARD1_CHECK( ADDINP, INSIZ, IN, OUTSIZ, OUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_CHECK

*  Purpose:
*     Check the order of operands and operators

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_CHECK( ADDINP, INSIZ, IN, OUTSIZ, OUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     If ADDINP is .TRUE., a "Load Supplied Mask" instruction is
*     inserted at the start of the returned expression stack.  A check
*     is then made that operators and operands occur in the correct
*     order in the supplied expression stack. .OR.  operators are
*     inserted anywhere where two operands occur without any
*     intervening operator. An error is reported if two operators occur
*     without any intervening operand.

*  Arguments:
*     ADDINP = LOGICAL (Given)
*        .TRUE. if an INPUT keyword is to be inserted at the start of
*        the ARD description.
*     INSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the input expression stack.
*     IN( INSIZ ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The input expression stack. The last value in this array
*        should be a code representing the "End Expression" instruction.
*     OUTSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the output expression stack.
*     OUT( OUTSIZ ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The output expression stack. This is a copy of the input
*        expression stack, with the potential addition of some OR
*        operators and an LKR instruction.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
