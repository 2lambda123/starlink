*     TYPE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier for the region type.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the array.
*     NPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the PAR array.
*     PAR( NPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The parameters defining the region.
*     UC( NDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The user coordinates at the position to be tested.
*     INIT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Supplied .TRUE. if a new region is being filled.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     ARD1_INTR = LOGICAL 
*        .TRUE. if the supplied user position (UC) is within, or on 
*        the boundary of, the specified region, and .FALSE. otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     - No check is made that the supplied number of parameters is correct.
*     This should have been checked before calling this routine.

*  BOX: Parameters are the supplied user co-ordinates of the box 
*  centre, followed by the lengths of the box sides in user co-ordinates. 
*  Box edges are always considered to be lines of constant axis values.
*  These are not necessarily geodesics. If a side length is negative, the
*  axis value must lie outside the specified range. This becuase (for
*  instance), and RA range from 359 degs to 1 deg *includes values less
*  than 1 and greater than 359.

*  the vector rotates. If this vector does a complete revolution whilst
*  traversing the boundary the test point is inside the polygon. If the
*  test poin is outside the polygon, then the overall rotation will be
*  zero (counting clockwise rotation as positive and anticlockwise rotation
*  as negative). Initialize the total angle through which the vector has

*  I to vertex J. If the angle is exactly PI, then the point is on the
*  boundary, which is considered to be within the region, so leave the loop
*  early. Otherwise, add the angle onto the running sum.
