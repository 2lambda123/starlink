      SUBROUTINE ARD1_NOT( NDIM, LBND, UBND, MSKSIZ, B, LBEXTB,

*  Name:
*     ARD1_NOT

*  Purpose:
*     Perform an NOT operation on two arrays

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_NOT( NDIM, LBND, UBND, MSKSIZ, B, LBEXTB,
*                    UBEXTB, LBINTB, UBINTB, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     All values in the supplied array are inverted (interior goes to
*     exterior, exterior goes to interior background), and the interior
*     and exterior bounding boxes are swapped.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in each array.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of each array.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of each array.
*     MSKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The total number of elements in each array.
*     B( MSKSIZ ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The operand array (in vector form). This should hold zero for
*        all exterior points, and a positive value for all interior
*        points. The results of the operation are written back into
*        this array.
*     LBEXTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBEXTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. 
*     LBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
