*  Name:
*     ARD1_BXBOX

*  Purpose:
*     Assign a constant value to a box region specified in user
*     co-ordinates.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_BXBOX( NDIM, FRM, LBND, UBND, MSKSIZ, VALUE, LBOX, UBOX, 
*                      NPAR, D, PAR, B, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     All pixels which are within the supplied bounding box and also
*     within the user-box defined by PAR are assign the value given by
*     argument VALUE. A general N-d algorithm is used.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the array.
*     FRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to the user coord Frame.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of the array.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of the array.
*     MSKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The total number of elements in the array.
*     VALUE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value to be assigned to the box.
*     LBOX( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the box. A value of VAL__MAXI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of
*        VAL__MINI for element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBOX( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the box.
*     NPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        No. of values in PAR.
*     D( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The coefficients of the user->pixel mapping. There should be
*        NDIM*(NDIM+1) elements in the array. The mapping is:
*
*        P1 = D0 + D1*U1 + D2*U2 + ...  + Dn*Un
*        P2 = Dn+1 + Dn+2*U1 + Dn+3*U2 + ...  + D2n+1*Un
*        ...
*        Pn = ...
*     PAR( NPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Parameters; user coords of box centre, followed by length of each 
*        side of the box (in user coords).
*     B( MSKSIZ ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The array (in vector form).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Working in a variable number of dimensions introduces complications
*  not met if the dimensionality is fixed; particularly, arrays cannot
*  be declared with the correct number of dimensions (since the number
*  is only known at run-time). They can therefore only be declared as
*  1-d vectors. The position of each pixel in the box found above can
*  be described in several ways;
*
*  1. By Cartesian pixel indices.
*
*  2. By a single vector address starting with 1 at the lower bounds
*  corner of the box and increasing to BOXSIZ at the upper bounds
*  corner (where BOXSIZ = total number of pixels in the box).
*
*  3. By a single vector address starting with 1 at the lower bounds
*  corner of the array B and increasing to MSKSIZ at the upper bounds
*  corner (where MSKSIZ = total number of pixels in array B).
*
*  The pixels forming the box will have continuus vector addresses
*  using system 2. above, but will have gaps using system 3.  The
*  first task is to establish constants needed to be able to transform
*  positions from system 2. to system 3. (only system 3. can be used to
