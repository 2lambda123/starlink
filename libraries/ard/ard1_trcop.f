      SUBROUTINE ARD1_TRCOP( NDIM, CIN, COUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_TRCOP

*  Purpose:
*     Copy the co-efficients of a linear transformation

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_TRCOP( NDIM, CIN, COUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The co-efficients supplied in CIN are copied to COUT.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensionality of the co-ordinate system.
*     CIN( * ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input co-efficients. The array should hold
*        NDIM*( NDIM + 1 ) values.
*     COUT( * ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The output co-efficients. The array should hold
*        NDIM*( NDIM + 1 ) values.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
