      SUBROUTINE ARD1_STORR( VALUE, SIZE, NEXT, PNTR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_STORR

*  Purpose:
*     Store a real value in a dynamic array

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_STORR( VALUE, SIZE, NEXT, PNTR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied value is stored in the array pointed to by PNTR, at
*     the index given by NEXT. The array is extended if there is
*     insufficient room to do this. NEXT is increment to point to the
*     next element in the array, and SIZE is returned holding the new
*     array size.

*  Arguments:
*     VALUE = REAL (Given)
*        The value to be stored.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The current size of the array.
*     NEXT = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The array index at which to store the value. Incremented by one
*        on return.
*     PNTR = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        A pointer to the real array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Check inherited global status.

*  Increment the index at which the next value will be stored.
