      SUBROUTINE ARD1_WHO( RINDEX, NDIM, MSKSIZ, B, LBEXTB, UBEXTB,

*  Name:
*     ARD1_WHO

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise an array to hold a WHOLE region.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_WHO( RINDEX, NDIM, MSKSIZ, B, LBEXTB, UBEXTB, LBINTB,
*                    UBINTB, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The array B is filled with interior values. The interior bounding
*     box is returned "infinite" and the exterior bounding box is
*     returned "null".

*  Arguments:
*     RINDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value to use to represent interior points.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the mask.
*     MSKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The total number of elements in the B array.
*     B( MSKSIZ ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The array.
*     LBEXTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        returned to indicate an "infinite" box. Other elements should
*        be ignored.
*     UBEXTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. The returned values should be ignored
*        since the box is "infinite".
*     LBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
