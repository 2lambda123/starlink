      SUBROUTINE ARD1_ARGS2( ELEM, L, IGRP, NARG, I, MORE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_ARGS2

*  Purpose:
*     Copy an argument list from an element of an ARD description into
*     a GRP group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_ARGS2( ELEM, L, IGRP, NARG, I, MORE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     If a new argument list is being constructed, look for the opening
*     parenthesis. Then go on to copy the remaining text from the ARD
*     expression into the returned group, up to the closing parenthesis 
*     or the end of the element (which ever comes first). If
*     the closing parenthesis has not been reached, return in order for
*     a new element to be obtained so that the construction of the
*     argument list can be continued by a further call to this routine.

*  Arguments:
*     ELEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An element of an ARD description.
*     L = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the last non-blank character in ELEM.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identifier for the group in which to store any remaining
*        text in ELEM.
*     NARG = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of elements stored in IGRP so far. It should be
*        supplied equal to -1 if the opening parenthesis which marks
*        the start of the argument list has not yet been found.
*     I = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The index within ELEM of the next character to be checked.
*     MORE = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        .TRUE. if an argument list is currently being assembled.
*        Returned .FALSE. if the argument list is completed.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
