*  Name:
*     ARD1_KDRAW

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise an array to hold an interior value at all pixels
*     through which a specified curve passes, and the exterior value 
*     at all other points.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_KDRAW( RINDEX, NDIM, LBND, UBND, MSKSIZ, TYPE, IWCS, NPAR, 
*                      PAR, IPB, LBEXTB, UBEXTB, LBINTB, UBINTB, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The array B is initialised by setting all values within the
*     supplied interior bounding box to the exterior value 0.
*     All points outside this box already hold exterior values.
*     Interior values are then assigned to all pixels through which the
*     curve specified by the supplied region passes.
*
*     This routine will only handle regions with zero area/volume.

*  Arguments:
*     RINDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value to use to represent interior points.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the B array.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of the B array.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of the B array.
*     MSKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The total number of elements in the B array.
*     TYPE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The symbolic value representing the region type.
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifer for an AST FrameSet. The Base Frame should be 
*        PIXEL coordinates within the B array. The Current Frame should 
*        be user coordinates.
*     NPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the PAR array.
*     PAR( NPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The parameters defining the region.
*     IPB = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to the B array, which should be an array of MSKSIZ
*        integers.
*     LBEXTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBEXTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. 
*     LBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  A straight line in user coords could conceivably correspond to a curve

*  a Plot in which "graphics" coordinates corresponds to PIXEL coordinates
*  in the grid, and use ARD1_GLINE as the routine for "plotting" lines.
*  In fact ARD1_GLINE "draws" by storing interior values within pixels in
*  the grid. First store the bounds of the B array in PIXEL coords.
