      SUBROUTINE ARD1_INVRS( NDIM, C, D, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_INVRS

*  Purpose:
*     Invert a linear mapping

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_INVRS( NDIM, C, D, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The arrays representing linear mappings have NDIM "rows" and
*     NDIM+1 "columns". Column 0 is a vector giving the translational
*     offset to add into the transformed position. The remaining NDIM
*     columns give the multiplicative matrix relating input and output
*     positions. An SLALIB routine is used to invert this matrix, and
*     the inverted matrix is used to find the appropriate offset vector
*     for the returned array of co-efficients. 

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        No. of dimensions
*     C( 0:NDIM, NDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The supplied mapping.
*     D( 0:NDIM, NDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The inverse mapping.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
