*  Name:
*     ARD1_LINFL

*  Purpose:
*     Draw a line into a mask.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_LINFL( RINDEX, NDIM, LBND, UBND, MSKSIZ, NPAR, PAR, B,
*                      LBINTB, UBINTB, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Pixels which intersect the specified line are assigned the value
*     given by rindex. Other pixels are left unchanged. The interior
*     bounding box is updated to include the new line.  The supplied
*     parameters are the pixel co-ordinates of the two end points of
*     the line.
*
*     The section of the line which intersects the array is first
*     found. Each axis is then processed as follows: The points at
*     which the line passes through each pixel boundary on the current
*     axis are found. The pixel indices of the pixels on each side of
*     this boundary are found, and marked as interior.

*  Arguments:
*     RINDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value to use to represent interior points.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the B array.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of the B array.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of the B array.
*     MSKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The total number of elements in the B array.
*     NPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the PAR array.
*     PAR( NPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        A list of pixel co-ordinates, in groups of NDIM. 
*     B( MSKSIZ ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The array.
*     LBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
