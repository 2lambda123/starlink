      SUBROUTINE ARD1_GTOV( NDIM, LBND, UBND, GR, VA, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARD1_GTOV

*  Purpose:
*     Convert from N-d Cartesian pixel coords to vector address.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_GTOV( NDIM, LBND, UBND, INDX, VA, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied pixel coords are converted into the vector
*     address for the same point (given the supplied bounds of the
*     array). If any of the pixel coords are outside the range
*     specified by UBND and LBND, then VA is returned as zero.
*
*     pixel cordinates are like pixel coordinates except that 
*     pixel I extends from I-0.5 to I+0.5.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the array.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of the array.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of the array.
*     GR( NDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The pixel coordinates of the point.
*     VA = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The vector address.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
