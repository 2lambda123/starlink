*  Name:
*     ARD1_AND

*  Purpose:
*     Perform an AND operation on two arrays

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_AND( NDIM, LBND, UBND, MSKSIZ, A, LBEXTA,
*                    UBEXTA, LBINTA, UBINTA, B, LBEXTB, UBEXTB, LBINTB,
*                    UBINTB, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied interior and exterior bounding boxes of the two
*     arrays are combined to produce a bounding box for the area in
*     which the result of the .AND. operation may differ from the
*     supplied contents of the B array. The operation is then performed
*     between the two supplied arrays within this box, and the results
*     are returned in B (over-writing the supplied values). All B
*     values outside the box are left unaltered. The exterior and
*     interior bounding boxes of the resulting array are calculated and
*     over-write the boxes supplied for array B.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in each array.
*     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of each array.
*     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of each array.
*     MSKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The total number of elements in each array.
*     A( MSKSIZ ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first operand array (in vector form). This should hold zero
*        for all exterior points, and a positive value for all interior
*        points.
*     LBEXTA( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in A. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBEXTA( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in A.
*     LBINTA( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in A. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBINTA( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in A.
*     B( MSKSIZ ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The second operand array (in vector form). This should hold
*        zero for all exterior points, and a positive value for all
*        interior points. The results of the operation are written back
*        into this array.
*     LBEXTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBEXTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        exterior points in B.
*     LBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B. A value of VAL__MAXI for element 1 is
*        used to indicate an infinite box, and a value of VAL__MINI for
*        element 1 is used to indicate a zero sized box.
*     UBINTB( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the smallest box which contains all
*        interior points in B.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
