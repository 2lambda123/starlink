A major upgrade to the ARD library has been made. The current release
(V2.0) introduces new features which enable positions within ARD
expressions to be supplied in a much wider range of coordinate systems
than prevously. For instance, if there is an RA/DEC calibration 
associated with the pixel array, then the ARD description can contain
positions in any of the common celestial coordinate systems. 

A new routine ARD_PLOT has been added which will draw a curve on a
graphics device around the boundary of a supplied 2-dimensional ARD 
description.

Full details are available in SUN/183.
