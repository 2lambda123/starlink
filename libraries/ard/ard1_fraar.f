*  Name:
*     ARD1_FRAAR

*  Purpose:
*     Assemble argument list for an FRAME keyword

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARD1_FRAAR( NWCS, CFRM, ELEM, L, IPOPND, IOPND, SZOPND, NARG,
*                      I, KEYW, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied arguments are stored on the operand stack.

*  Arguments:
*     NWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensionality of the ARD description (i.e. the number of
*        values required to specify a position).
*     CFRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to a Frame describing user coordinates.
*     ELEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An element of an ARD description.
*     L = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the final character in ELEM to be checked.
*     IPOPND = INTEGER (Given)
*        The pointer to the array holding the operand stack.
*     IOPND = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The index within the operand stack at which the next value
*        should be stored.
*     SZOPND = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The size of the operand stack. This is increased if necessary.
*     NARG = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of arguments so far obtained. This should be
*        supplied equal to -1 if no argument list has yet been found.
*     I = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The index of the next character to be checked in ELEM.
*     KEYW = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Returned as .FALSE. if the argument list for the keyword has
*        been completed.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
