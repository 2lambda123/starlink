      SUBROUTINE SGS1_CHKZN ( ZONE, RZD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SGS1_CHKZN

*  Purpose:
*     Get zone descriptor from zone number

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SGS1_GETZN ( ZONE, RZD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Given the SGS Zone Number, the corresponding Zone
*     descriptor is found.

*  Arguments:
*     ZONE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The SGS Zone identifier
*     RZD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The zone descriptor 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     The Zone number is looked up in the SGSPA Common block.
*     If it is found, then the descriptor corresponding to
*     its position in the table is returned.
