      SUBROUTINE PGP_DEACT ( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PGP_DEACT

*  Purpose:
*     De-activate ADAM PGPLOT.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PGP_DEACT ( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     De-activate ADAM PGPLOT after use by an application.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     On entry, the STATUS variable holds the global status value.
*     If the given value of STATUS is SAI__OK and the routine fails to
*     complete, STATUS will be set to an appropriate error number.
*     If the given value of STATUS is not SAI__OK, then the routine
*     will still attempt to execute and will return with STATUS
*     unchanged.

*  Algorithm:
*     Free all resources still allocated.
*     Shut down PGPLOT.
