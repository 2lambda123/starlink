      SUBROUTINE PGP1_CHKUN ( UNIT, RUD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PGP1_CHKUN

*  Purpose:
*     Get unit descriptor from unit number

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PGP1_CHKUN ( UNIT, RUD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Given the PGPLOT Unit Number, the corresponding Unit
*     descriptor is found.

*  Arguments:
*     UNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The PGPLOT Unit identifier
*     RUD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The unit descriptor 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     The Unit number is looked up in the PGPPA Common block.
*     If it is found, then the descriptor corresponding to
*     its position in the table is returned.
