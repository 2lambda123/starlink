*  Name:
*     ONE_SCRSZ

*  Purpose:
*     A Fortran callable function to obtain the size of the output screen.

*  Language:
*     C, designed to be called from Fortran.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ONE_SCRSZ( WIDTH, HEIGHT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine interrogates the system to find the width and height of the screen
*     on which it is running.  Should an error occur or the width is
*     not positive, set to the default of 80 characters by 0 lines.

*  Arguments:
*     WIDTH = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The width of the screen in characters. (default 80)
*     HEIGHT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The height of the screen in lines. (default 0)
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*        Set to SAI__ERROR if an error occurs..

*  Notes:
*     This is the UNIX version.

*        Changed names to add to Odds & Ends Library
*     12-SEP-2000 (RTP)
*        Set default values 80 x 0, taken from Fortran version
