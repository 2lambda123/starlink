      SUBROUTINE CAT1_TIDTP (GI, IDTYP, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_TIDTP
*  Purpose:
*     Determine the type of a component.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_TIDTP (GI; IDTYP; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Determine the type of a component.  The possibilities are:
*     catalogue, column (or field), parameter, expression, index,
*     selection or join.
*
*     Note that this internal routine deliberately does not report
*     any error.
*  Arguments:
*     GI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier to a component.
*     IDTYP  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Type of the identifier, coded according to the following 
*        scheme:
*        CAT__CITYP - catalogue,
*        CAT__FITYP - column (or field),
*        CAT__QITYP - parameter,
*        CAT__EITYP - expression,
*        CAT__IITYP - index,
*        CAT__SITYP - selection,
*        CAT__JITYP - join.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     If the identifier is greater than zero and less or equal to the
*     total number of identifiers then
*       Get the type of the identifier.
*     else
*       Set the return status.
*       Set the parent identifier to null.
*     end if
