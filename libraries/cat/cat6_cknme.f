      SUBROUTINE CAT6_CKNME (CNAME, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT6_CKNME
*  Purpose:
*     Check that a tab-separated table column name conforms to CAT rules.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT6_CKNME (CNAME; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Check that a tab-separated table column name conforms to CAT rules.
*
*     Tab-separated table column names often contain characters which
*     are not permitted in CAT column names.  Such illegal characters
*     are replaced by an underscore and a valid CAT name generated.
*     tab-separated tables cannot contain vector columns, so only the
*     simple case of CAT scalar columns need be handled.
*  Arguments:
*     CNAME  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Column name.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     If the name is not completely blank then
*       Remove any leading blanks.
*       Take a copy (for use in warning messages).
*       If the first character is not alphabetic then
*         Inset an alphabetic character at the start of the name.
*         Set the name modified flag.
*       end if
*       For each character
*         If the character is not either alphabetic or numeric then
*           Replace the character with an underscore.
*           Set the name modified flag.
*         end if
*       end for
*       If the name was modified then
*         Report a message (not an error).
*       end if
*     else
*       Report an error.
*     end if
