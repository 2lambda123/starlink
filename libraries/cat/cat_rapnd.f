      SUBROUTINE CAT_RAPND (CI, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT_RAPND 
*  Purpose:
*     Append the current row buffer to the end of the catalogue.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT_RAPND (CI; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Append the current row buffer as a new row at the end of the
*     catalogue.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Catalogue identifier.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Note that the actual writing to the catalogue files is actually
*     handled by the back-end specific parts of the PUT routines.  All
*     that is required here is to increment the current row number and
*     the total number of rows.
*
*     Obtain the common block array element for the catalogue.
*     Obtain the access mode of the catalogue.
*     If the catalogue was opened for 'WRITE' then
*       Increment the current row number.
*       Increment the total number of rows.
*     else
*       Set the status.
*     end if
