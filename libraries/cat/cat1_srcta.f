      SUBROUTINE CAT1_SRCTA (STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_SRCTA
*  Purpose:
*     Read AST data as text from a catalogue.
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_SRCTA (STATUS)
*  Description:
*     This is a service routine to be provided as a "source" routine
*     for the AST_CHANNEL function. It reads data from a catalogue
*     (in response to reading from an AST Channel) and delivers it to
*     the AST library for interpretation.
*
*     This routine has only a STATUS argument, so it communicates with
*     other CAT routines via global variables stored in the CAT1_AST_CMN
*     common block.
*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Do while (more)
*       Attempt to read a line of textual information.
*       If ok and not finished then
*         If the textual information is of class AST then
*           Set the 'found AST frame-set' flag.
*           Strip off the AST signature.
*           If the text corresponds to a new AST line then
*             If the AST line buffer is not empty then
*               Send the line to the AST library.
*               Initialise the AST line.
*             end if
*             Add the text line to the AST line.
*             Set the termination flag (because an AST line has been
*             completed).
*           else (the text line is an AST continuation line)
*             If there is sufficient space in the AST line then
*               Append the text line to the AST line.
*             else
*               Set the status.
*               Report an error.
*             end if
*           else (bad AST line)
*             Set the status.
*             Report an error.
*           end if
*         end if
*       else (failure or finished reading textual information)
*         Set the termination flag.
*         If finished then
*           If the AST line buffer is not empty then
*             Send the line to the AST library.
*           end if
*         end if
*       end if
*     end do
