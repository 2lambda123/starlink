      SUBROUTINE CAT_GETXT (CI, FINISH, CLASS, TEXT, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT_GETXT
*  Purpose:
*     Get the next line of textual information from a catalogue.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT_GETXT (CI; FINISH, CLASS, TEXT; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Get the next line of textual information from a catalogue.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*         Catalogue identifier.
*     FINISH   =  LOGICAL (Returned)
*         Flag indicating whether a line of text was obtained, coded as
*         follows:
*         .FALSE. -  a line was obtained ok; input of of textual
*                    information continues.
*         .TRUE.  -  all the textual information has already been
*                    returned; input of textual information has 
*                    terminated.
*     CLASS   =  CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*         Class of the textual information.  A set of values are
*         permitted for each type of catalogue back-end (or file 
*         format), and these sets are different for different back-ends.
*         Note that this argument is returned rather than given; an 
*         application cannot prescribe to CAT what class of textual 
*         information is required.
*     TEXT   =  CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*         A single line of textual information.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Determine the type of the identifier.
*     If the identifier is for a catalogue then
*       Determine the back-end type.
*       Get the next line of text.
*       If the string is a ling of AST information then
*         Set the class to AST.
*       end if
*     else
*       Set the status: invalid identifier.
*     end if
*     Report any error.
