      SUBROUTINE CAT1_PRSVN (VNAME, CNAME, VELEM, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_PRSVN
*  Purpose:
*     Parse a vector element name.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_PRSVN (VNAME; CNAME, VELEM; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Parse a vector element name to yield the component name and
*     vector element.  A vector element name comprises the name of
*     component followed, without spaces, by the element number
*     enclosed in square brackets.  For example: MAG[5].  In this
*     example the routine would return with CNAME = 'MAG' and VELEM = 5.
*
*     Note that if the parse fails then the return status is set but
*     NO ERROR IS REPORTED.  It is assumed that the calling routine
*     will handle this condition.
*  Arguments:
*     VNAME  =  CHARACTER (Given)
*        The vector element name to be parsed.
*     CNAME  =  CHARACTER (Returned)
*        The component name for the vector element.
*     VELEM  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        The element number for the vector element.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     If the name is not completely blank then
*       Check that the last character is ']'
*       If ok then
*         Attempt to locate the '['
*         If ok then
*           If the '[' is not at the start of the string then
*             Extract the component name.
*             If the '[' and ']' are not adjacent then
*               Attempt to decode their contents as an integer number.
*             else
*               Set the return status.
*             end if
*           else
*             Set the return status.
*           end if
*         else
*           Set the return status.
*         end if
*       else
*         Set the return status.
*       end if
*     else
*       Set the return status.
*     end if
