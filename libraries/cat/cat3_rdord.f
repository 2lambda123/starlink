      SUBROUTINE CAT3_RDORD (FITUNT, ONAME, ORDER, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT3_RDORD
*  Purpose:
*     Read the name of the column on which the table is sorted.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT3_RDORD (FITUNT; ONAME, ORDER; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Read the name of the column on which the table is sorted (or
*     ordered).
*
*     The name is read from the standard FITS tables keyword
*     TSORTKEY.  The absence of this keyword indicates that the table
*     is unsorted, and in this case ONAME is returned set to blank,
*     ORDER is set to CAT__NOORD (unordered) and the return status
*     remains ok.
*  Arguments:
*     FITUNT  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Fortran unit number for accessing the FITS table.
*     ONAME  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        The name of the column on which the table is sorted (or
*        ordered).  If the table is not sorted on any column
*        ONAME is returned set to blank.
*     ORDER  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        The way in which ONAME is sorted.  The possibilities are:
*        CAT__ASCND  -  ascending,
*        CAT__DSCND  -  descending.
*        If ONAME is returned as blank ORDER is returned as CAT__NOORD,
*        corresponding to un-ordered.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Attempt to get the value of the sorted column keyword TSORTKEY.
*     If ok then
*       Determine whether the column is in ascending or descending 
*       order.
*       Obtain the name of the column.
*     else
*       Set the name of the column to blank.
*       Set the order to unordered.
*     end if
*
*     Note that the two cases of the keyword being absent and an error
*     occurring are not differentiated.  In both cases the name of the
*     colunm is returned as blank and the status is ok.
