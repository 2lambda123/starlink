*
*    Flag determining whether the table of values for the catalogue is
*    in the description file or a separate file.  The permitted values
*    are:
*
*    CAT1__INDSC  - in the description file.
*    CAT1__SEPFL  - in a separate file.

      INTEGER DFLFG__CAT1

*
*    Variable holding the name of the file containing the table of values
*    if the table is in a separate file, otherwise unused.

      CHARACTER DFILE__CAT1*(CAT__SZCNF)

*
*    Flag indicating whether columns in the table are identified by
*    the COLUMN sequence number or the position of the first CHARACTER.
*    The permitted values are:
*
*    CAT1__PSCOL  - by COLUMN,
*    CAT1__PSCHR  - by CHARACTER.

      INTEGER DPOSN__CAT1

*
*    The size of each record in the table, in bytes.  This value is only
*    used for direct access binary catalogues.

      INTEGER DRESZ__CAT1

*
*    The number of rows in the table.

      INTEGER DROWS__CAT1

*
*    The number of header rows to skip at the start of the table.

      INTEGER DSKIP__CAT1

*
*    Number of columns in the table.

      INTEGER DCOLS__CAT1

*
*    Number of parameters in the table.

      INTEGER DPARS__CAT1

*
*    Number of lines in the description part of the description file.
*    This count includes everything up to and including any 'BEGINTABLE'.

      INTEGER DDESC__CAT1

*
*    Arrays holding additional details for individual columns.

      INTEGER   DFID__CAT1(CAT__MXCOL)                ! Identifiers.
      INTEGER   DPOS__CAT1(CAT__MXCOL)                ! Positions.
      CHARACTER DFMT__CAT1(CAT__MXCOL)*(CAT__SZEXF)   ! Format in table.

*    Common blocks.
