      SUBROUTINE CAT5_GETXT (CI, FINISH, CLASS, TEXT, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT5_GETXT
*  Purpose:
*     Get the next line of textual information from a small text list.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT5_GETXT (CI; FINISH, CLASS, TEXT; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Get the next line of textual information from a small text list.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*         Catalogue identifier.
*     FINISH   =  LOGICAL (Returned)
*         Flag indicating whether a line of text was obtained, coded as
*         follows:
*         .FALSE. -  a line was obtained ok; input of of textual
*                    information continues.
*         .TRUE.  -  all the textual information has already been
*                    returned; input of textual information has 
*                    terminated.
*     CLASS   =  CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*         Class of the textual information.  A set of values are
*         permitted for each type of catalogue back-end (or file 
*         format), and these sets are different for different back-ends.
*         Note that this argument is returned rather than given; an 
*         application cannot prescribe to CAT what class of textual 
*         information is required.
*     TEXT   =  CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*         A single line of textual information.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Determine the common block array element for the catalogue.
*     Get the Fortran unit number for accessing the description file.
*     If the last element of the description has not already been 
*     found then
*       Attempt to read a record from the description file.
*       If ok then
*         Copy the record read to the return string.
*         Set the return flag to 'not finished'.
*         Attempt to determine the class of the line of text (and if
*         the class is 'BEGINTABLE' then set the 'last element of
*         the description found' flag).
*       else
*         Set the return flag to finished.
*         Set the return string to blank.
*         Set the return class to blank.
*         If the status is end-of-file then
*           Reset the status to ok.
*         else
*           Report an error.
*         end if
*       end if
*     else
*       Set the return flag to finished.
*       Set the return string to blank.
*       Set the return class to blank.
*     end if
