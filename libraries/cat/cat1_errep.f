      SUBROUTINE CAT1_ERREP (PARAM, MESSGE, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_ERREP
*  Purpose:
*     Report an error message.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_ERREP (PARAM, MESSGE; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Report an error message.
*
*     Note that this routine attempts to execute irrespective of the
*     status on input.
*  Arguments:
*     PARAM  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Name of the external parameter with which the error is
*        associated.
*     MESSGE  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Message to be reported with the error.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Construct the local version of the error message and determine
*     its length.
*     Translate the CAT status into a message and determine its
*     length.
*     Construct the error message based on the translation of the error
*     code.
*     Construct the parameter name for the second message.
*     Report the error messages.
*
*     Notes:
*
*     (1) This routine contains code for reporting the error via both
*         the ADAM error system and a simple Fortran PRINT statement.
*         Whichever is not required should be commented out.
*
*     (2) The translation and reporting of the CAT status has been
*         commented out because this facility is now provided by the
*         ADAM error system.  However, the code is retained (as
*         comments) so that it can be reinstated if CAT was ever
*         used without ADAM.  The revised routine is little more than
*         a wrap-around for ERR_REP.
