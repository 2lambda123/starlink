      SUBROUTINE ANT_ERR (MESSGE)
*+
*  Name:
*     ANT_ERR
*  Purpose:
*     Report an error message from the parser.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL ANT_ERR (MESSGE)
*  Description:
*     Report an error message from the parser.
*
*     The parser knows nothing of the CAT or ADAM status, so the error
*     is reported using MSG_OUT and a local status.  If MSG_OUT fails
*     then an error is reported with ERR_REP.
*  Arguments:
*     MESSGE  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Error message to be reported.
*  Algorithm:
*     Assemble the text string and report the message.
