      SUBROUTINE CAT6_GETXT (CI, FINISH, CLASS, TEXT, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT6_GETXT
*  Purpose:
*     Get the next line of textual information from a tab-separated table.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT6_GETXT (CI; FINISH, CLASS, TEXT; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Get the next line of textual information from a tab-separated table.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*         Catalogue identifier.
*     FINISH   =  LOGICAL (Returned)
*         Flag indicating whether a line of text was obtained, coded as
*         follows:
*         .FALSE. -  a line was obtained ok; input of of textual
*                    information continues.
*         .TRUE.  -  all the textual information has already been
*                    returned; input of textual information has
*                    terminated.
*     CLASS   =  CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*         Class of the textual information.  A set of values are
*         permitted for each type of catalogue back-end (or file
*         format), and these sets are different for different back-ends.
*         Note that this argument is returned rather than given; an
*         application cannot prescribe to CAT what class of textual
*         information is required.
*     TEXT   =  CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*         A single line of textual information.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Set the tab-separator character.
*     Determine the common block array element for the catalogue.
*     Get the Fortran unit number for accessing the description file.
*     Get the current header record.
*     Get the total number of header records.
*     If the current header record is less than the total number of
*     records then
*       Attempt to read a record from the table.
*       If ok then
*         Increment the number of the current record.
*         Obtain the class and text of the record, as follows:-
*         If the current record is the first record then
*           If the total number of records is more than two then
*             Set the class to 'NOTE'.
*             Copy the value.
*           else
*             Set the class to 'COLUMNS'
*             Replace tab characters with spaces.
*             Copy the text.
*           end if
*         else the current record is the penumtimate header record then
*           Set the class to 'COLUMNS'
*           Replace tab characters with spaces.
*           Copy the text.
*         else if the current record is the last header record then
*           Set the class to 'BEGINTABLE'
*           Replace tab characters with spaces.
*           Copy the text.
*         else
*           If the line is blank then
*             Set the class to 'NOTE'
*             Set the text to blank.
*           else
*             Split the line into words
*             If the first word starts with '#' then
*               Set the class to 'NOTE'
*             else if the first word ends in ':' then
*               Set the class to 'PARAMETER'
*             else
*               Set the class to 'COMMENT'
*             end if
*             Copy the text.
*           end if
*         end if
*       else (attempted read failed)
*         Set the finished flag to 'finished'.
*         Set the class to blank.
*         Set the text to blank.
*       end if
*     else (last header record already read)
*       Set the finished flag to 'finished'.
*       Set the class to blank.
*       Set the text to blank.
*     end if
