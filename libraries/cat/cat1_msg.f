      SUBROUTINE CAT1_MSG (PARAM, MESSGE, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_MSG
*  Purpose:
*     Report a message.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_MSG (PARAM, MESSGE; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Report a message.
*
*     This routine will only execute if the running status is ok (that
*     is, it behaves like a normal CAT or ADAM routine).
*  Arguments:
*     PARAM  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Name of the external parameter with which the message is 
*        associated.
*     MESSGE  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Message to be reported.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Report the message if not in 'quiet' mode.
*
*     Note: this routine contains code for reporting the message via
*     both the ADAM error system and a simple Fortran PRINT statement.
*     Whichever is not required should be commented out.

*  History:
*     15/6/94  (ACD): Original version.
*     23/11/94 (ACD): Prefixed message with '!(Info.)'.
*     14/2/96  (ACD): Fixed an illegal bug in the ADAM version; a
*        variable length character argument was concatenated.
*     4/7/96   (ACD): Inserting missing argument in call to MSG_OUT
*        (this bug was presumably introduced by the fix of 14/2/96
*        because the routine worked previously).
*     10/12/96 (ACD): Passed argument PARAM rather than a blank string
*        to MSG_OUT.
*     1/7/99   (ACD): Added a space after '!(Info.)'.
*     21/12/99 (ACD): Modified to only report if messages is not in
*        'quiet' mode.
*  Bugs:
*     None known
