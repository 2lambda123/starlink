      SUBROUTINE CAT5_STNUL (NULVAL, ROWS, NULCOL, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT5_STNUL
*  Purpose:
*     Set a column of null value flags to a single value.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT5_STNUL (NULVAL, ROWS; NULCOL; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Set a column of null value flags to a single value.
*  Arguments:
*     NULVAL  =  LOGICAL (Given)
*        Value to which the column is to be set.
*     ROWS  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of rows in the column.
*     NULCOL(ROWS)  =  LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Column of null value flags.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Set every row in the column to the required value.
