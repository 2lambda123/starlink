      SUBROUTINE CAT_TNDNT (CI, IDTYP, N, GI, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT_TNDNT
*  Purpose:
*     Get an identifier for the Nth (pre-existing) component of a
*     given type.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT_TNDNT (CI, IDTYP, N; GI; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Get an identifier for the Nth (pre-existing) component of a
*     given type.  If N components of the required type could not be
*     found for the specified catalogue then the null identifier
*     (CAT__NOID is returned) and the running status remains ok.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Catalogue identifier.
*     IDTYP  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Type of identifier required, coded as follows:
*        CAT__CITYP - catalogue,
*        CAT__FITYP - column (or field),
*        CAT__QITYP - parameter,
*        CAT__EITYP - expression,
*        CAT__IITYP - index,
*        CAT__SITYP - selection,
*        CAT__JITYP - join.
*     N  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of the component, of the specified type, that is
*        required.
*     GI  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifier to the required component.  If the required
*        component could not be found GI is set to CAT__NOID.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Set the number of components with the correct type and parentage
*     to zero.
*     Set the current element in the identifier arrays to zero.
*     Do while (continue searching)
*       Increment the current element in the identifier arrays.
*       If (the current element in the identifier arrays is less than
*       the total number of elements used) then
*         If (the type and parentage of the current element are equal
*         to the required values) then
*           Increment the number of components with the correct
*           parentage and type.
*           If (the number of components with the correct parentage and
*           type is equal the to required number) then
*             The required component has been found:
*             Set the termination flag,
*             Copy the current identifier to the returned identifier.
*           end if
*         end if
*       else
*         All the identifiers have been examined without finding the
*         required component:
*         Set the termination flag,
*         Set the returned identifier to null.
*       end if
*     end do
