      SUBROUTINE CAT1_FINCR (CI, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_FINCR
*  Purpose:
*     Finish the inital creation of a catalogue.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_FINCR (CI; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Finish the intial creation of the files associated with a new 
*     catalogue.
*
*     The functions performed by this routine are as follows:
*
*      - maybe the initial creation of the files (though this may
*        have been done by TOPEN - individual back-ends will vary),
*      - creation of any mandatory header information,
*      - writing the parameters to the files,
*      - writing the column details to the files.
*
*     However, at least in this first implementation, most of this
*     functionality goes on inside the back-end for the appropriate
*     catalogue.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  INTEGER (Given)
*        Catalogue identifier.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Determine the array element corresponding to the catalogue.
*     If ok then
*       Determine the back-end type.
*       Invoke the appropriate back-end.
*     end if
