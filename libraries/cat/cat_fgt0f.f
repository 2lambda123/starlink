      SUBROUTINE CAT_FGT0F (CI, ROWNO, GI, VALUE, NULFLG, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT_FGT0F
*  Purpose:
*     Get the formatted value of a scalar expression or field for a given row.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT_FGT0F (CI, ROWNO, GI; VALUE, NULFLG; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Get the formatted value of a scalar expression or field for a 
*     given row.  The row may be in either a catalogue, selection or
*     index.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Catalogue, selection or index identifier.  The row number,
*        ROWNO (below), refers to the row number in the catalogue,
*        selection or index, as appropriate.
*     ROWNO  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of the row to be read.
*     GI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier for either an expression, field or parameter.
*     VALUE  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        Value to which the expression evaluates for the current row
*        buffer.  If the expression evaluates to null the string 
*        returned is '<null>' if VALUE contains six or more characters,
*        otherwise it is '?'.
*     NULFLG  =  LOGICAL (Returned)
*        A flag indicating whether or not the expression evaluates to 
*        the null value or not:
*        .TRUE.  - The expression is null,
*        .FALSE. - The expression is not null; a genuine value is 
*                  available.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Get the specified row as the current row.
*     Obtain the value of the field or expression in the current row.
*     Report any error.
