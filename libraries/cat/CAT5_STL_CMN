*
*    Parametric constants.
*    ====================

*
*    The maximum permitted number of rows in a small text list.

      INTEGER CAT5__MXROW
      PARAMETER (CAT5__MXROW = 15000)

*
*    The minimum permitted deviation of the scale factor and zero
*    point from 1.0D0 and 0.0D0 respectively if the column is to be
*    scaled.

      DOUBLE PRECISION CAT5__MNSCL
      PARAMETER (CAT5__MNSCL = 1.0D-8)

*
*    Maximum permitted number of columns in a small text list.

      INTEGER CAT5__MXCOL
      PARAMETER (CAT5__MXCOL = 200)

*
*    Common block variables.
*    ======================

*
*    Fortran unit number for the description file.

      INTEGER
     :  STUNT__CAT5(CAT__MXCAT)

*
*    Flag indicating whether or not the description file has been
*    completely read.

      LOGICAL
     :  FNDSC__CAT5(CAT__MXCAT)

*
*    Flag indicating whether or not the description file for an output
*    catalogue is to be written in 'Kappa format' or as a standard STL.
*    The coding is as follows:
*     .TRUE.  -  write as 'Kappa format',
*     .FALSE. -  write as standard STL.

      LOGICAL
     :  KFLAG__CAT5(CAT__MXCAT)

*
*    Details defining the position of and format of each field within
*    a single record.

      INTEGER
     :  FPOSN__CAT5(CAT1__MXIDS),  ! Position of each field.
     :  FDTYP__CAT5(CAT1__MXIDS),  ! Data type code.
     :  FCSIZ__CAT5(CAT1__MXIDS),  ! Size of CHARACTER columns.
     :  FPTR__CAT5(CAT1__MXIDS),   ! Pointers to columns.
     :  FPTRN__CAT5(CAT1__MXIDS)   ! Pointers to null value flags.
      CHARACTER
     :  FFMT__CAT5(CAT1__MXIDS)*(CAT__SZEXF)   ! Column format.
