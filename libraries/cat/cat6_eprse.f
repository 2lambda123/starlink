      SUBROUTINE CAT6_EPRSE (LINE, PRSMSG, FIRST, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT6_EPRSE
*  Purpose:
*     Report an error parsing the tab-separated table.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_EDSCR (LINE, PRSMSG; FIRST; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Report an error parsing the tab-separated table.
*
*     Note that parser errors are reported as messages rather than
*     errors because no bad running status has been set.  The displayed
*     message starts with an exclamation mark for consistency with
*     other errors (and because the GUI expects one).
*  Arguments:
*     LINE  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Sequence number of the line in the description file.  If a
*        negative or zero li9ne number is given it is not incorporated
*        into the message.
*     PRSMSG  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Status text associated with the failure of the line to parse.
*     FIRST  =  LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Flag indicating whether it is the first parser error which
*        is being reported.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     If this is the first message then
*       Output the 'invalid description file message'.
*     end if
*     Assemble and output the message.
