*     23/6/93 (ACD): Original version.
*     13/8/93 (ACD): First stable version.
*     9/3/94  (ACD): Changed variables to occur in the common block
*        in order of decreasing size of data type.
*     6/3/95  (ACD): Modified to reflect the changed names for the
*        constants defining the array sizes.
*     11/4/95 (ACD): Changed the name given in the 'Name:' section of
*        the prologue to reflect Unix rather than VMS conventions.
*     23/7/96 (ACD): Added EROW__CAT1, the expected number of rows.
