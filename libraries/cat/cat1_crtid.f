      SUBROUTINE CAT1_CRTID (IDTYPE, IDPRN, ID, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_CRTID 
*  Purpose:
*     Attempt to create a new identifier.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_CRTID (IDTYPE, IDPRN; ID; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Attempt to create a new identifier and add it to the list of 
*     identifiers.
*  Arguments:
*     IDTYPE  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Type of identifier to be created: catalogue, column etc.
*     IDPRN  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier to the parent of the identifier that is to be
*        created.
*     ID  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        New identifier created.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     If there is space for a new identifier at the end of the
*     identifiers list then
*       increment the number of identifiers.
*       Set the new identifier to the end of the list
*     else (the array is full)
*       Attempt to find a released location within the list
*     end if
*     If a suitable location was found then
*       Copy the details of the identifier to the common block.
*     else
*       Set the return argument containing the value of the identifier
*       to the null identifier.
*       Set the status.
*       Report the error.
*     end if

*     23/1/94 (ACD): Modified error reporting.
*     6/3/95  (ACD): Modified to reflect the changed names for the

*     7/3/95  (ACD): Added initialisation of array IDCEL__CAT1.
*     11/4/95 (ACD): Changed the name of the null identifier.
*     27/5/98 (ACD): Properly implemented IDATT__CAT1 for speeding up
