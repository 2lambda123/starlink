      SUBROUTINE CAT_TOPEN (CNAME, STATE, MODE, CI, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT_TOPEN
*  Purpose:
*       Open a catalogue and obtain an identifier to it.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT_TOPEN (CNAME, STATE, MODE; CI; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Open a catalogue and obtain an identifier to it.
*
*     The matrix of possibilities for STATE and MODE is:
*
*     STATE = 'NEW', then 
*       MODE = 'WRITE' is ok 
*       and MODE = 'READ' if forbidden.
*
*     STATE = 'OLD' then
*       MODE = 'WRITE' is ok
*       and MODE = 'READ' is ok.
*
*     Notes:
*
*     * If a catalogue already exists and an attempt is made to open
*       it with STATE = 'NEW', CAT_TOPEN will fail with an error.
*
*     * If an existing catalogue is opened with STATE = 'OLD' and
*       MODE = 'WRITE' it will be overwritten.
*
*  Arguments:
*     CNAME  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Catalogue name.
*     STATE  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Required state of the catalogue.  One of:
*        NEW  -  A new catalogue is to be created,
*        OLD  -  An existing (that is, old) catalogue is to be opened.
*     MODE  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Mode in which the catalogue will be accessed.  One of:
*        READ   -  the catalogue may only be read from,
*        WRITE  -  an new catalogue is to be written.
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Catalogue identifier.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Attempt to open the catalogue.
*     Report any error.

*  History:
*     17/11/98 (ACD): New version which merely calls an internal
*        routine and reports any error.  The previous CAT_TOPEN
*        became subroutine CAT1_TOPEN.

*     None known
