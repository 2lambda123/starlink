      SUBROUTINE CAT1_ANGDC (ANGLEC, ANCODE, ANGLER, CONVOK, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAP_ANGDC
*  Purpose:
*     Decode an angle from a CHARACTER string.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_ANGDC (ANGLEC, ANCODE; ANGLER, CONVOK; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Decode an angle from a CHARACTER string.  Unless the units
*     are explicitly set the string is interpretted as follows.  If the
*     first non-blank character is '+' or '-' the angle is deemed to
*     have units of degrees; otherwise it is deemed to have units of hours
*     (this behaviour is based on the supposition that hours only occur in
*     the range 0 to 24).  A consequence is that any angle in degrees must
*     always be preceded  by a sign, even if it is positive.
*
*     The hours or degrees, minutes and seconds must be separated by a
*     colon (':').  Either the seconds or the minutes and the seconds
*     may be omitted.  Only the least significant unit (hours or
*     degrees, minutes or seconds, as appropriate) may contain a fractional
*     part; the more significant items must be integer numbers.
*
*     If the units are minutes of arc or time then they may optionally
*     be subdivided into sexagemsimal seconds.  If so the minutes and
*     seconds must be separated by a colon (':').
*  Arguments:
*     ANGLEC  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        String containing the angle expressed in a sexagesimal format.
*     ANCODE  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Code specifying the units, as follows:
*        CAT1__HOUR  -  hours,
*        CAT1__DEG   -  degrees,
*        CAT1__SDEG  -  if explicitly signed degrees, otherwise hours,
*        CAT1__ARMIN -  minutes of arc,
*        CAT1__TIMIN -     "    "  time,
*        CAT1__ARSEC -  seconds of arc,
*        CAT1__TISEC -     "    "  time.
*     ANGLER  =  DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Corresponding angle in radians.
*     CONVOK  =  LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Flag indicating whether the conversion was ok, coded as
*        follows:
*        .TRUE.  -  converted ok,
*        .FALSE. -  failed to convert.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     If the string is not entirely blank then
*       Take a copy of the angle.
*       Remove any leading blanks.
*       Determine whether the units of the angle are hours or degrees,
*       using the presence or absence of a sign if appropriate.
*       Determine the length of the string.
*       Replace any colons with spaces.
*       Attempt to convert the angle to radians.
*       If the conversion is ok then
*         If the original angle was in hours then
*           Multiply the result by 15.
*         end if
*       else
*         Set the conversion failed flag.
*       end if
*     else (the string is blank)
*       Set the result to zero.
*     end if
