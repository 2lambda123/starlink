      SUBROUTINE CAT1_DCNL<T> (NULCHR, NULVAL, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_DCNL<T>
*  Purpose:
*     Decode a null value from a character string.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_DCNL<T> NULCHR; (NULVAL; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Decode a null value from a character string.
*  Arguments:
*     NULCHR  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Character string from which the null value is to be
*        decoded.
*     NULVAL  =  <TYPE> (Returned)
*        Null value decoded from the string.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Equivalence a local character string with a local buffer of the
*     same type as the output value.
*     Copy the input character string to the local string.
*     Copy the local buffer to the return null value.
