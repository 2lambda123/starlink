      SUBROUTINE CAT1_RJLST (NUMSEL, SELIST, ROWS, CATLST, NUMREJ,
     :  REJLST, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_RJLST
*  Purpose:
*     Create a list of rejected rows from a list of selected rows.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_RJLST (NUMSEL, SELIST, ROWS; CATLST; NUMREJ, REJLST;
*       STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Create a list of rejected rows in a catalogue from a list of
*     selected rows.
*  Arguments:
*     NUMSEL  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of rows to be selected.
*     SELIST(NUMSEL)  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Array of row numbers to be selected.
*     ROWS  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of rows in the catalogue.
*     CATLST(ROWS)  =  INTEGER (Work)
*        Work array with one entry for every row in the catalogue.
*     NUMREJ  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of rows rejected.
*     REJLST(ROWS)  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        List of rejected rows.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Initialise every row in the catalogue list to rejected.
*     For every selected row
*       Set the entry in the catalogue list to selected.
*     end for
*     For every row in the catalogue list
*       If the row is still rejected then
*         Increment the number of rejects.
*         Add the row to the list of rejects.
*       end if
*     end for
