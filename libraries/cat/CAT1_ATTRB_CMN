*  Name:
*     CAT1_ATTRB_CMN
*  Purpose:
*     Internal common block holdling the list of attributes.
*  Language:
*     FORTRAN 77.
*  Type of Module:
*     INCLUDE FILE.
*  Description:
*     Internal common block holdling the list of attributes.
*
*     Every attribute is defined by five quantities:
*
*      - the identifier for the component to which it belongs,
*      - its name (defining the type of attribute it is),
*      - a flag indicating whether or not it is mutable,
*      - its data type,
*      - its value.
*
*     A set of 4 arrays hold the first four quantities for each 
*     attribute.  The value is held in one of a set of arrays, with
*     one array for each data type.  A 5th array, parallel to the
*     first 4, indicates which element of the appropriate value
*     array hold the value.

*     23/6/93 (ACD): Original version.
*     20/7/93 (ACD): First stable version.
*     9/3/94  (ACD): Changed variables to occur in the common block
*        in order of decreasing size of data type.
*     6/3/95  (ACD): Modified to reflect the changed names for the
*        constants defining the array sizes.
*     11/4/95 (ACD): Changed the name given in the 'Name:' section of
*        the prologue to reflect Unix rather than VMS conventions.
*     27/5/98 (ACD): Removed the separate array sizes and counts for
*        the individual data types.
