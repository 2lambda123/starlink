      SUBROUTINE CAT1_BHOPB (CI, FI, ROWS, ORDER, XVALB, L, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_BHOPB
*  Purpose:
*     Locate row number corresponding to a value by binary chop.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_BHOPB (CI, FI, ROWS, ORDER, XVALB; L; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Perform a binary chop to locate the row in a catalogue for
*     which the field of a column corresponds to a given value.  The
*     column must be sorted into ascending or descending order.  The
*     corresponding row, L, of column X is defined such that:
*
*     For an ascending column:   X[L]   .GE. XVALB  and
*                                X[L-1] .LT. XVALB
*
*     For a descending column:   X[L]   .LE. XVALB  and
*                                X[L-1] .GT. XVALB
*
*     where XVAL is the given (target) value.
*
*     For a column in ascending order:
*       if the target value is .LE. the first row then a row number
*       of zero is returned,
*
*       if the target value is .GT. than the last row then a row
*       number of the number of rows + 1 is returned.
*
*     Note that the routine only works for numeric columns and values.
*     For CHARACTER and LOGICAL columns and values it will compile but
*     usually will not produce sensible results.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Catalogue identifier.
*     FI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Column identifier.
*     ROWS  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of rows in the catalogue.
*     ORDER  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Flag indicating the ordering of the column.  It must adopt
*        either of the following two values:
*        CAT__ASCND   -  for an ascending column,
*        CAT__DSCND   -  for an descending column.
*        All other values will cause the routine to exit with an error.
*     XVALB  =  BYTE (Given)
*        Target value for which the corresponding row is to be located.
*     L  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Row number corresponding to XVAL.  See the comments above for
*        the value returned if the target value is outside the range
*        of the column.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Convert the value to DOUBLE PRECISION.
*     If the column is in ascending order then
*       If the first element is .LT. the target value then
*         If the last element is .GE. the target value then
*           (the target value lies in the range of the column)
*           Set the current row to (number of rows / 2).
*           Set the jump (to the next row) to the number of rows.
*           Do while (row corresponding to target no found)
*             If the current row corresponds to the target then
*               Set the termination flag.
*               Set the returned row number.
*             else
*               Compute the new jump (half the existing jump).
*               Force the jump to be at least one.
*               If the current row .GE. the target value then
*                 new row = current row - jump
*               else
*                 new row = current row + jump
*               end if
*             end if
*           end do
*         else (last element .LT. target)
*           Set the returned row number to number of rows + 1.
*         end if
*       else (first element .GE. than target) then
*         Set the returned row number to 0.
*       end if
*     else if the column is in descending order then
*       .
*       . As for an ascending column, but with the tests for
*       . inqualities reversed.
*       .
*     else (the column order is invalid).
*       Set the returned row to 0.
*       Set the error status.
*       Report an error.
*     end if
*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Does not handle null values.

      SUBROUTINE CAT1_BHOPD (CI, FI, ROWS, ORDER, XVALD, L, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_BHOPD
*  Purpose:
*     Locate row number corresponding to a value by binary chop.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_BHOPD (CI, FI, ROWS, ORDER, XVALD; L; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Perform a binary chop to locate the row in a catalogue for
*     which the field of a column corresponds to a given value.  The
*     column must be sorted into ascending or descending order.  The
*     corresponding row, L, of column X is defined such that:
*
*     For an ascending column:   X[L]   .GE. XVALD  and
*                                X[L-1] .LT. XVALD
*
*     For a descending column:   X[L]   .LE. XVALD  and
*                                X[L-1] .GT. XVALD
*
*     where XVAL is the given (target) value.
*
*     For a column in ascending order:
*       if the target value is .LE. the first row then a row number
*       of zero is returned,
*
*       if the target value is .GT. than the last row then a row
*       number of the number of rows + 1 is returned.
*
*     Note that the routine only works for numeric columns and values.
*     For CHARACTER and LOGICAL columns and values it will compile but
*     usually will not produce sensible results.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Catalogue identifier.
*     FI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Column identifier.
*     ROWS  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of rows in the catalogue.
*     ORDER  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Flag indicating the ordering of the column.  It must adopt
*        either of the following two values:
*        CAT__ASCND   -  for an ascending column,
*        CAT__DSCND   -  for an descending column.
*        All other values will cause the routine to exit with an error.
*     XVALD  =  DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Target value for which the corresponding row is to be located.
*     L  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Row number corresponding to XVAL.  See the comments above for
*        the value returned if the target value is outside the range
*        of the column.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Convert the value to DOUBLE PRECISION.
*     If the column is in ascending order then
*       If the first element is .LT. the target value then
*         If the last element is .GE. the target value then
*           (the target value lies in the range of the column)
*           Set the current row to (number of rows / 2).
*           Set the jump (to the next row) to the number of rows.
*           Do while (row corresponding to target no found)
*             If the current row corresponds to the target then
*               Set the termination flag.
*               Set the returned row number.
*             else
*               Compute the new jump (half the existing jump).
*               Force the jump to be at least one.
*               If the current row .GE. the target value then
*                 new row = current row - jump
*               else
*                 new row = current row + jump

*           end do

*         end if
*       else (first element .GE. than target) then
*         Set the returned row number to 0.

*       . As for an ascending column, but with the tests for
*       . inqualities reversed.
*       .
*     else (the column order is invalid).

*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_BHOPI
*  Purpose:
*     Locate row number corresponding to a value by binary chop.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_BHOPI (CI, FI, ROWS, ORDER, XVALI; L; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Perform a binary chop to locate the row in a catalogue for
*     which the field of a column corresponds to a given value.  The
*     column must be sorted into ascending or descending order.  The
*     corresponding row, L, of column X is defined such that:
*
*     For an ascending column:   X[L]   .GE. XVALI  and
*                                X[L-1] .LT. XVALI
*
*     For a descending column:   X[L]   .LE. XVALI  and
*                                X[L-1] .GT. XVALI
*
*     where XVAL is the given (target) value.
*
*     For a column in ascending order:
*       if the target value is .LE. the first row then a row number
*       of zero is returned,
*
*       if the target value is .GT. than the last row then a row
*       number of the number of rows + 1 is returned.
*
*     Note that the routine only works for numeric columns and values.
*     For CHARACTER and LOGICAL columns and values it will compile but
*     usually will not produce sensible results.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Catalogue identifier.
*     FI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Column identifier.
*     ROWS  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of rows in the catalogue.
*     ORDER  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Flag indicating the ordering of the column.  It must adopt
*        either of the following two values:
*        CAT__ASCND   -  for an ascending column,
*        CAT__DSCND   -  for an descending column.
*        All other values will cause the routine to exit with an error.
*     XVALI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Target value for which the corresponding row is to be located.
*     L  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Row number corresponding to XVAL.  See the comments above for
*        the value returned if the target value is outside the range
*        of the column.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Convert the value to DOUBLE PRECISION.
*     If the column is in ascending order then
*       If the first element is .LT. the target value then
*         If the last element is .GE. the target value then
*           (the target value lies in the range of the column)
*           Set the current row to (number of rows / 2).
*           Set the jump (to the next row) to the number of rows.
*           Do while (row corresponding to target no found)
*             If the current row corresponds to the target then
*               Set the termination flag.
*               Set the returned row number.
*             else
*               Compute the new jump (half the existing jump).
*               Force the jump to be at least one.
*               If the current row .GE. the target value then
*                 new row = current row - jump
*               else
*                 new row = current row + jump
*               end if
*             end if
*           end do
*         else (last element .LT. target)
*           Set the returned row number to number of rows + 1.
*         end if
*       else (first element .GE. than target) then
*         Set the returned row number to 0.
*       end if
*     else if the column is in descending order then
*       .
*       . As for an ascending column, but with the tests for
*       . inqualities reversed.
*       .
*     else (the column order is invalid).
*       Set the returned row to 0.
*       Set the error status.
*       Report an error.
*     end if
*  Implementation Deficiencies:

*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_BHOPL
*  Purpose:
*     Locate row number corresponding to a value by binary chop.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_BHOPL (CI, FI, ROWS, ORDER, XVALL; L; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Perform a binary chop to locate the row in a catalogue for
*     which the field of a column corresponds to a given value.  The
*     column must be sorted into ascending or descending order.  The
*     corresponding row, L, of column X is defined such that:
*
*     For an ascending column:   X[L]   .GE. XVALL  and
*                                X[L-1] .LT. XVALL
*
*     For a descending column:   X[L]   .LE. XVALL  and
*                                X[L-1] .GT. XVALL
*
*     where XVAL is the given (target) value.
*
*     For a column in ascending order:
*       if the target value is .LE. the first row then a row number
*       of zero is returned,
*
*       if the target value is .GT. than the last row then a row
*       number of the number of rows + 1 is returned.
*
*     Note that the routine only works for numeric columns and values.
*     For CHARACTER and LOGICAL columns and values it will compile but
*     usually will not produce sensible results.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Catalogue identifier.
*     FI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Column identifier.
*     ROWS  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of rows in the catalogue.
*     ORDER  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Flag indicating the ordering of the column.  It must adopt
*        either of the following two values:
*        CAT__ASCND   -  for an ascending column,
*        CAT__DSCND   -  for an descending column.
*        All other values will cause the routine to exit with an error.
*     XVALL  =  LOGICAL (Given)
*        Target value for which the corresponding row is to be located.
*     L  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Row number corresponding to XVAL.  See the comments above for
*        the value returned if the target value is outside the range
*        of the column.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Convert the value to DOUBLE PRECISION.
*     If the column is in ascending order then
*       If the first element is .LT. the target value then
*         If the last element is .GE. the target value then
*           (the target value lies in the range of the column)
*           Set the current row to (number of rows / 2).
*           Set the jump (to the next row) to the number of rows.
*           Do while (row corresponding to target no found)
*             If the current row corresponds to the target then
*               Set the termination flag.
*               Set the returned row number.
*             else
*               Compute the new jump (half the existing jump).
*               Force the jump to be at least one.
*               If the current row .GE. the target value then
*                 new row = current row - jump
*               else
*                 new row = current row + jump
*               end if
*             end if
*           end do
*         else (last element .LT. target)
*           Set the returned row number to number of rows + 1.
*         end if
*       else (first element .GE. than target) then
*         Set the returned row number to 0.
*       end if
*     else if the column is in descending order then
*       .
*       . As for an ascending column, but with the tests for
*       . inqualities reversed.
*       .
*     else (the column order is invalid).
*       Set the returned row to 0.
*       Set the error status.
*       Report an error.
*     end if

*  Description:
*     Perform a binary chop to locate the row in a catalogue for
*     which the field of a column corresponds to a given value.  The
*     column must be sorted into ascending or descending order.  The
*     corresponding row, L, of column X is defined such that:
*
*     For an ascending column:   X[L]   .GE. XVALR  and
*                                X[L-1] .LT. XVALR

*
*     where XVAL is the given (target) value.
*
*     For a column in ascending order:
*       if the target value is .LE. the first row then a row number
*       of zero is returned,
*
*       if the target value is .GT. than the last row then a row
*       number of the number of rows + 1 is returned.
*
*     Note that the routine only works for numeric columns and values.
*     For CHARACTER and LOGICAL columns and values it will compile but
*     usually will not produce sensible results.

*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Convert the value to DOUBLE PRECISION.
*     If the column is in ascending order then
*       If the first element is .LT. the target value then
*         If the last element is .GE. the target value then
*           (the target value lies in the range of the column)
*           Set the current row to (number of rows / 2).
*           Set the jump (to the next row) to the number of rows.
*           Do while (row corresponding to target no found)
*             If the current row corresponds to the target then
*               Set the termination flag.
*               Set the returned row number.
*             else
*               Compute the new jump (half the existing jump).
*               Force the jump to be at least one.

*       had been revealed by the port to Linux).
*     26/5/97  (ACD): Fixed a bug which could cause the routine to loop
*       indefinitely if the target value lay between the first and
*       second rows.
