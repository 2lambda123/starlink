      SUBROUTINE CAT1_ANPRS (FORMAT, SEP, PLUS, LEAD, UNITS, NSGDIV,
     :  DECPL, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_ANPRS
*  Purpose:
*     Parse a CAT angle format specifier.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_ANPRS (FORMAT; SEP, PLUS, LEAD, UNITS, NSGDIV, DECPL;
*       STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Parse a CAT angle format specifier.  The specifier is decoded into
*     a set of descriptors, each of which describes one aspect of the angular
*     format.  The set of descriptors can be used to format an angle in
*     radians into a sexagesimal representation in hours or degrees.
*
*     A CAT angle format specifier has the form:
*
*        RADIANS{sexagesimal_format_description}
*
*     The sexagesimal_format_description is described in full in
*     SUN/181, the CAT Programmer's Manual.  An example is 'L+ZHMS.2',
*     which corresponds to output in hours, minutes and seconds, with
*     the seconds expressed to two places of decimals.  Letters (h, m, s)
*     are used as separators, a plus sign is included in positive angles
*     and leading zeroes are shown.
*  Arguments:
*     FORMAT  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The given CAT angle format specifier to be decoded.
*     SEP  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        The separator to be used between the hours or degrees, minutes
*        and seconds.  The options are:
*        CAT1__ISO    -  ISO standard; a colon (':'),
*        CAT1__BLANK  -  a blank,
*        CAT1__LETTR  -  a letter (h, d, m, s, as appropriate).
*     PLUS  =  LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Is a plus character ('+') to precede positive angles, coded
*        as follows:
*        .TRUE.  -  insert plus character,
*        .FALSE. -  do not insert plus character.
*     LEAD  =  LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Insert leading zeroes before the hours or degrees, coded as
*        follows,
*        .TRUE.  -  insert leading zeroes,
*        .FALSE. -  do not insert leading zeroes.
*     UNITS  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Units in which the angle is to be represented.  The options
*        are:
*        CAT1__HOUR  -  hours,
*        CAT1__DEG   -  degrees,
*        CAT1__TIMIN -  minutes of time,
*        CAT1__ARMIN -  minutes of arc,
*        CAT1__TISEC -  seconds of time,
*        CAT1__ARSEC -  seconds of arc.
*     NSGDIV  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of sexagesimal subdivisions into which the angle is
*        be divided.  For example, an angle to be represented as hours,
*        minutes and seconds would have two sexagesimal subdivisions.
*        An angle to be represented as just hours and minutes, or a
*        (usually small) angle to be represented as minutes and seconds
*        would have just one.
*     DECPL  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of decimal places to follow the smallest subdivision
*        of the angle.  For example, for an angle to be represented as
*        hours, minutes and seconds, it would be the number of decimal
*        places of the seconds.  For an angle simply represented as
*        (decimal) degrees it would be the number of decimal places of
*        the degrees.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Take a working copy of the given format specifier.
*     Convert the specifier to upper case.
*     Remove the leading string 'RADIANS{'.
*     Determine the length of the string.
*     Remove any trailing '}'.
*     Replace any simple synonym specifiers with their real equivalents.
*     Set the default values for the descriptors and flags.
*     Examine every element of the format specifier and set the
*     descriptors and flags as appropriate.
*     Determine the required units from the flags.
*     Determine the number of sexagesimal subdivisions required from
*     the flags.
*     If there is a decimal point then
*       Determine the number of decimal points required.
