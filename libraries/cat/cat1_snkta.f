      SUBROUTINE CAT1_SNKTA (STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_SNKTA
*  Purpose:
*     Write AST data as text to a catalogue.
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_SNKTA (STATUS)
*  Description:
*     This is a service routine to be provided as a "sink" routine for
*     the AST_CHANNEL function. It takes data in the form of text (in
*     response to writing an AST object to a Channel) and delivers it
*     to a catalogue for storage.
*
*     This routine has only a STATUS argument, so it communicates with
*     other CAT routines via global variables stored in the CAT1_AST_CMN
*     common block.
*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Attempt to get a line of AST information.
*     If ok then
*       If the line is not blank then
*         Copy the AST line to a local work buffer.
*         If the copied string is not blank then
*           Remove leading blanks.
*           Find the length of the remaining string.
*           Determine the number of text lines that the AST line must
*           be split up into.
*           For every text line
*             Compute the start and stop points in the AST line.
*             Assemble the text line.
*             Write the text line to the catalogue.
*           end for
*         end if
*       end if
*     end if

*       Attempt to get a line of AST information.  Proceed if all is
*       ok and the line is not blank.  Note that returned string
*       ASTLN is not necessarily padded with spaces beyond its last valid
*       character, LASTLN.

         CALL AST_GETLINE (ASTLN, LASTLN, STATUS)

         IF (STATUS .EQ. SAI__OK) THEN

               WORK = ASTLN(1 : LASTLN)

*
*             Check that the string copied is not blank.

               IF (WORK .NE. ' ') THEN

*
*                Remove any leading blanks.  This contraction removes
*                the indentation, which is intended for human readers,
*                and may reduce the number of continuation lines required.

                  CALL CHR_LDBLK (WORK)

*                Determine the number of text lines that the AST line must

*
*                Write each text line.  The first line corresponds to a new
*                AST line, the rest are continuation lines.  For new lines
*                a space immediately follows the AST signature.  For
*                continuations a '+' immediately follows the signature.

*
*                   Compute the start and stop positions of the current
