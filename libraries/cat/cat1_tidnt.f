      SUBROUTINE CAT1_TIDNT (CI, GNAME, GI, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_TIDNT 
*  Purpose:
*     Get an identifier for a named pre-existing component.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_TIDNT (CI, GNAME; GI; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Get an identifier for a named pre-existing component.  The 
*     component may be of any type.  If the specified component could 
*     not be found then GI is set to the null identifier.  If the
*     specified component could not be found an error status is NOT
*     raised.
*
*     The comparison of the given name with all the existing names is
*     case independent.
*  Arguments:
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier to the catalogue to which the component belongs.
*     GNAME  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Name of the component.  The component may be of any type.
*     GI  =  INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifier to the component.  The null identifier is returned
*        if the specified component could not be found.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Remember: the list of attributes holds the attributes for all
*     the components; an attribute is identified by its name and the
*     component to which it belongs.  The list of identifiers holds
*     details for every identifier.  The details for each identfier
*     include its value, its parent and its type, but not its name.
*     The name of an identifier is held as the value of the
*     attribute 'NAME' of that identifier.  Finally, it is a rule,
*     that a 'NAME' attribute will be of data type character.
*     
*     Hence:
*
*     If the identifier is valid then
*       For each element of the attributes array
*         If the attribute name is 'NAME' and
*            the attribute type is character and
*            the attribute value is the name given for the component then
*           For each element in the identifiers array
*             If the identifiers in the attributes and identifiers
*             arrays match and the parent matches the given catalogue
*             identifier then
*               The requiured identifier has been found; set the return
*               value.
*             end if
*           end for
*         end if
*       end for
*     end if
*     If the component was not found then
*       Set the return value to the null identifier.
*     end if
