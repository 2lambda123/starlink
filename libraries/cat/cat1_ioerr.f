      SUBROUTINE CAT1_IOERR (FSTAT, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAT1_IOERR
*  Purpose:
*     Translate and report a Fortran I/O error.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAT1_IOERR (FSTAT; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Translate and report a Fortran I/O error.
*
*     Note that this routine attempts to execute, irrespective of the
*     status on input.
*  Arguments:
*     FSTAT  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Fortran I/O error status.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     <...>
*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     This version of the routine is something of a kludge.
*
*     Also, this routine has the Fortran I/O statuses (sic)
*     corresponding to success and end-of-file hardwired as a local
*     parameter.  I think that, technically, this is standard and
*     portable, but it is a potential problem area.
*    
*     Note in passing (PWD 23/06/04) the Fortran standard defines EOF as
*     any return from IOSTAT less than zero, so this may not trap all
*     EOF cases.  However, most compilers return -1 for EOF and use
*     values less than this to indicate other returns, -2, end of record
*     (usually an internal read), -4 end of record (usually external
*     read). Anyway left this alone.

*    Note the this routine attempts to execute irrespective of the
*    running status on input,
*
*    Also note that though it will attempt to set the return status
*    if the Fortran I/O status is not ok, it will not over-write a
*    previously bad CAT status.

      IF (FSTAT .NE. FIOOK) THEN

*
*       Check for end-of-file and handle it as a special case.

         IF (FSTAT .EQ. EOF) THEN
            IF (STATUS .EQ. CAT__OK) THEN

            END IF

         ELSE
            IF (STATUS .EQ. CAT__OK) THEN
