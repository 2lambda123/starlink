      SUBROUTINE NDG_GTSUP( IGRP, I, FIELDS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG_GTSUP

*  Purpose:
*     Get supplemental information for an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG_GTSUP( IGRP, I, FIELDS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Returns the supplemental information associated with a given entry
*     in an NDG group. 

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDG group as returned by NDG_ASSOC, etc. This should be the last 
*        group in a GRP owner-slave chain.
*     I = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the required entry.
*     FIELDS( 6 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The supplemental information associated with the entry specified
*        by I. Each element of the returned array contains the following:
*
*           1 - NDF slice specification (if any)
*           2 - HDS path (if any)
*           3 - File type
*           4 - Base file name
*           5 - Directory path
*           6 - Full NDF specification 
*
*        This information is obtained from a set of groups associated with 
*        the supplied group IGRP by means of a chain of GRP "owner-slave"
*        relationships. If any of these groups do not exist, the correponding
*        elements of the above array are returned blank. Note, element 6,
*        the full NDF specification, is obtained directly from the supplied 
*        group IGRP.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
