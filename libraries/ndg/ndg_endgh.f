      SUBROUTINE NDG_ENDGH( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG_ENDGH

*  Purpose:
*     End a GRP NDF history block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG_ENDGH( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine should be called to mark the end of a GRP NDF
*     history block. The block should have been started by a
*     matching call to NDG_BEGGH. Note, GRP NDF history blocks must
*     not be nested.
*
*     During a GRP NDF history block, application code can register GRP
*     groups using routine NDG_ADDGH. When default history information is
*     written to any NDF, a handler routine is called that adds a new
*     history record to the NDF for each currently registered GRP group.
*     The new history record identifies the ADAM parameter with which the
*     group is associated, and lists the contents of the group (as it
*     existed at the time the group was registered - any subsequent changes
*     to the group contents are ignored).

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  stored in the NDF structure on disk will not be changed.
