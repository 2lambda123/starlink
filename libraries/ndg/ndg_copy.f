      SUBROUTINE NDG_COPY( IGRP1, INDXLO, INDXHI, REJECT, IGRP2,
     :                     STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG_COPY

*  Purpose:
*     Copy a section of an existing NDG group to a new group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG_COPY( IGRP, INDXLO, INDXHI, REJECT, IGRP2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine extends the functionality of GRP_COPY when copying
*     elements from a group created by NDG. Such groups have
*     "supplemental information" associated with them that holds further
*     information about each NDF in the group. This function ensures that
*     the returned group also has such supplemental information.
*
*     NDG's supplemental information is stored in a chain of "slave
*     groups" that are attached to each other using the facilities of
*     GRP (e.g. see GRP_SOWN). The supplied group is the lowest level
*     "slave" in this chain.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the input group.
*     INDXLO = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lowest index to reject or to copy.
*     INDXHI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The highest index to reject or to copy.
*     REJECT = LOGICAL ( Given)
*        If reject is .TRUE., then names in the given range are
*        rejected.  Otherwise, names in the given range are copied.
*     IGRP2 = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP identifier for the created group. Returned equal to
*        GRP__NOID if an error occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
