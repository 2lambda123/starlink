      SUBROUTINE NDG_BEGGH( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG_BEGGH

*  Purpose:
*     Begin a GRP NDF history block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG_BEGGH( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine should be called to mark the start of a GRP NDF
*     history block. The block should be ended by a matching
*     call to NDG_ENDGH. See NDG_ENDGH for more details.
*
*     Note - GRP NDF history blocks must not be nested.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
