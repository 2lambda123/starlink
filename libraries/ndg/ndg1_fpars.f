      SUBROUTINE NDG1_FPARS( SPEC, DIR, BN, SUF, SEC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG1_FPARS

*  Purpose:
*     Extracts fields from a full NDF specification.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG1_FPARS( SPEC, DIR, BN, SUF, SEC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine extracts and returned fields from the supplied NDF
*     specification.

*  Arguments:
*     SPEC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The full NDF file spec.
*     DIR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The directory path (ending at the final "\" in the spec).
*     BN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The file base name. Ends with the character preceeding the first
*        "." or "(" or "[" following the directory path.
*     SUF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        Any string following the file base name, and preceeding any
*        opening parenthesis. SUF will either be blank, or begin with a
*        dot or a "[".
*     SEC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        Any parenthesised string following the suffix.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     9-SEP-1999 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     18-JUL-2000 (DSB):
*        Use "[" as an additional delimiter for the basename, in order to
*        allow for foreign extension specifiers.
*     27-FEB-2001 (DSB):
*        Restructure to so that a "[..]" string is only treated as a
*        foreign extension specified if it ocurs at the end of the file basename
*        or after the file type. Such strings occurring within the file
*        basename will be treated as a globbing wildcard pattern.
