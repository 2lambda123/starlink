\section {Introduction}

If an application prompts the user for an NDF using the facilities of the NDF\_ 
system (see \xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{}), the user may only reply with the name of a single NDF. Some
applications allow many input NDFs to be specified and the need to
type in every NDF name explicitly each time the program is run can become time
consuming. The NDG package provides a means of giving the user the
ability to specify a list (or ``Group'') of NDFs as a reply to a single prompt
for an parameter. 

The current version of NDG can process NDFs which are stored as
components within an HDS container file, and can also process foreign
data formats using the system described in \xref{SSN/20}{ssn20}{}.


\section {Interaction Between NDG and GRP}
NDG uses the facilities of the GRP package and users of NDG should be familiar
with the content of \xref{SUN/150}{sun150}{} which describes the GRP package. Groups
created by NDG routines should be deleted when no longer needed using
\xref{GRP\_DELET}{sun150}{GRP\_DELET}.

\section {General overview of the NDG\_ system}
As a broad outline, applications use the NDG\_ package as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item A call is made to \htmlref{NDG\_ASSOC}{NDG\_ASSOC} which causes the user 
to be prompted for a single parameter. This parameter can be of any type.
The user replies with a ``group expression'' (see
\xref{SUN/150}{sun150}{}), which contains the names of a group of {\em
existing} NDFs to be used as inputs by the application\footnote{The routine
\htmlref{NDG\_ASEXP}{NDG\_ASEXP} performs the same function but does not
use the parameter system - it expects the group expression to be supplied by 
the calling routine.}. For instance, the group expression may be

\begin{verbatim}
     m51_b[23]s1_ds,m51_b[23]s2_ds,m51_b[23]s2?_ds,^files.lis
\end{verbatim}

This is a complicated example, probably more complicated than would be
used in practice, but it highlights the facilities of the GRP and NDG
packages, e.g. wild cards (``?'', ``$*$'' or ``[..]'' ), lists of files,
or indirection through a text file (``\verb+^+'').

The \htmlref{NDG\_ASSOC}{NDG\_ASSOC} routine produces a list of explicit NDF names, which are stored
internally within the GRP system. 

\item What happens next depends on the application, but a common example may be
the initiation of a DO loop to loop through the input NDFs (NDG\_ASSOC returns
the total number of NDF names in the group). 

\item To access a particular NDF, the application calls routine \htmlref{NDG\_NDFAS}{NDG\_NDFAS}
supplying an index, $n$, within the group (i.e $n$ is an integer in the range 1
to the group size returned by NDG\_ASSOC). NDG\_NDFAS returns an NDF identifier
to the $n$th NDF in the group. This identifier can then be used to access the
NDF in the normal manner using the NDF\_ routines (\xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{}). The identifier
should be annulled when it is no longer needed using \xref{NDF\_ANNUL}{sun33}{NDF\_ANNUL} in the
normal way.

\item Once the application has finished processing the group of NDFs, it calls 
\xref{GRP\_DELET}{sun150}{GRP\_DELET} which deletes the group, releasing all resources reserved by the group.

\item Routine NDG\_ASSOC can also be used to append a list of NDF names 
obtained from the environment, to a previously defined group.

The routine \htmlref{NDG\_CREAT}{NDG\_CREAT} produces a group containing the names of 
NDFs which are to be created by the application. The routine \htmlref{NDG\_NDFCR}{NDG\_NDFCR} will 
create a new NDF with a name given by a group member, and returns an NDF 
identifier to it. Routine \htmlref{NDG\_NDFPR}{NDG\_NDFPR} creates a new NDF by propagation from a 
previously existing NDF, in a similar manner to the NDF routine \xref{NDF\_PROP}{sun33}{NDF\_PROP} (see 
\xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{}).

The names of output NDFs given by users usually relate to the input NDF names.
When NDG\_CREAT is called, it creates a group of NDF names either by modifying
all the names in a specified input group using a ``modification element'' (see
\xref{SUN/150}{sun150}{}), or by getting a list of new names from the user. 

\item Applications which produce a group of output NDFs could also produce a
text file holding the names of the output NDFs. Such a file can be used
as input to the next application, using the indirection facility. A text
file listing of all the NDFs in a group can be produced by routine
GRP\_LIST (or GRP\_LISTF).

\end{enumerate}

See the detailed descriptions of \htmlref{NDG\_ASSOC}{NDG\_ASSOC} and \htmlref{NDG\_CREAT}{NDG\_CREAT} below for details 
of the processing of existing and new NDF names.

When this program is compiled and run, the user is asked for 
two ADAM parameters, IN and OUT.  Each NDF in the list specified
by the IN parameter is simply copied to the corresponding name in the 
list specified by the OUT parameter.  For instance, running
\begin{quote}
\latexonly{\small}
\begin{verbatim}
copy in=data[12] out=*-new
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
would write new NDFs {\tt data1-new.sdf} and {\tt data2-new.sdf}
which were copies of the existing files {\tt data1.sdf} and {\tt data2.sdf}.
If {\tt data1} and {\tt data2} do not represent NDF structures,
an error will be signalled and the user will be prompted to enter
a different value for IN.
If any of the elements of the IN list represents an HDS container file
which holds multiple NDF structures directly within it, each of these
will be added to the list of NDFs to be processed, and the
output list will be constructed with a corresponding structure.
For instance, if the HDS file {\tt obs.sdf} contains three NDFs at
its top level called O1, O2 and O3, then invoking
\begin{quote}
\latexonly{\small}
\begin{verbatim}
copy in=obs out=obs-copy
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
will result in a new container file {\tt obs-copy.sdf} being written, 
which contains three NDF structures called O1, O2 and O3.

Note that a few corners have been cut in the above code,
in particular checking that the input and output groups have the
same size and STATUS testing.  Additionally, no action is taken
when the FLAG character is given at the end of a group specification --
conventionally this would indicate that the user should be allowed
to add further members.

   \sstdescription{
      The supplied group expression is parsed (using the facilities of
      the GRP routine GRP\_GROUP, see SUN/150) to produce a list of

      the supplied group (a new group is created if none is supplied).
      NDF identifiers for particular members of the group can be obtained
      using NDG\_NDFAS.

      If any of the NDFs specified by the group expression cannot be
      accessed, an error is reported and STATUS is returned equal to
      NDG\_\_NOFIL. If this happens strings holding the name of each
      bad NDF are appended to the group identified by IGRP1 (so long
      as IGRP1 is not equal to GRP\_\_NOID).

   \sstnotes{
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         Any file names containing wildcards are expanded into a list of NDF
         names. The supplied strings are interpreted by a shell (/bin/tcsh if
         it exists, otherwise /bin/csh, otherwise /bin/sh), and so may
         contain shell meta-characters (e.g. twiddle, \$HOME, even command
         substitution and pipes - but pipe characters {\tt "}$|${\tt "} need to be escaped
         using a backslash {\tt "}$\backslash${\tt "} to avoid them being interpreted as GRP
         editing characters).

         \sstitem
         Each supplied name may include an HDS path. For instance,
         {\tt "}/home/dsb/mydata.a.c(1).b{\tt "} refers to an NDF stored in component
         {\tt "}a.c(1).b{\tt "} in the HDS container file /home/dsb/mydata.sdf. Note,
         wild cards are not allowed within HDS component paths (i.e. they
         are only allowed within the specification of the container file).

         \sstitem
         If an HDS object is specified which is not an NDF, then the
         object will be searched for NDF components. This search is
         recursive, in that any components of the specified object are also
         searched. The supplied name will be expanded into a group of names,
         one for each NDF found within the specified HDS object. Note, NDFs
         are not themselves searched for other NDFs. That is, the expanded
         group of names will not include any NDF which is contained within
         another NDF (i.e. NDFs which are stored as an extension item of
         another NDF are not included in the group). For instance, if the
         string {\tt "}fred{\tt "} is given, the HDS file fred.sdf will be searched for
         NDFs and the returned group will contain references for all NDFs
         found within fred.sdf.

         \sstitem
         If the environment variable NDF\_FORMATS\_IN is defined (see
         SSN/20) then all possible NDFs matching the supplied string are
         included in the returned group. For instance, if the string {\tt "}fred{\tt "}
         is supplied, then the returned group will contain references to all
         files with basename fred which also have a file type specified in
         NDF\_FORMATS\_IN. If a FITS file {\tt "}fred.fit{\tt "} exists, and HDS file
         {\tt "}fred.sdf{\tt "} also exists (and contains an NDF), then supplying the
         name {\tt "}fred{\tt "} will result in both being included in the returned
         group. If the file {\tt "}fred.sdf{\tt "} contains a component called {\tt "}.fit{\tt "},
         then this will be included in the returned group in place of
         {\tt "}fred.sdf{\tt "}.

         \sstitem
         NDFs contained within HDS files are opened in order to ensure
         that they are valid NDFs. The NDF name is returned in IGRP1 if there
         are no valid NDFs matching a supplied name. No check is made that any
         foreign data files contain valid NDFs since this would involve a
         potentially expensive data conversion. So, for instance, {\tt "}$*$.fit{\tt "} could
         pick up FITS catalogues as well as FITS images. If a foreign data file
         does not contain a valid NDF, an error will be reported when the NDF
         is accessed using NDG\_NDFAS.

         \sstitem
         Each element in the returned group contains a full specification
         for an NDF. Several other groups are created by this routine, and
         are associated with the returned group by means of a GRP {\tt "}owner-slave{\tt "}
         relationship. These supplemental groups are automatically deleted
         when the returned group is deleted using GRP\_DELET. The returned
         group should not be altered using GRP directly because corresponding
         changes may need to be made to the supplemental groups. Routines
         NDG\_SETSZ, NDG\_GTSUP and NDG\_PTSUP are provided to manipulate the
         entire chain of groups. The full chain (starting from the head) is
         as follows:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         Any file names containing wildcards or "[..]" globbing patterns
	 are expanded into a list of NDF names. The supplied strings are
	 interpreted by a shell (/bin/tcsh if it exists, otherwise
	 /bin/csh, otherwise /bin/sh), and so may contain shell
	 meta-characters (e.g. twiddle, \$HOME, even command substitution
	 and pipes - but pipe characters {\tt "}$|${\tt "} need to be
	 escaped using a backslash {\tt "}$\backslash${\tt "} to avoid
	 them being interpreted as GRP editing characters).

         \sstitem
         Each supplied name may include an HDS path. For instance,
         {\tt "}/home/dsb/mydata.a.c(1).b{\tt "} refers to an NDF stored in component
         {\tt "}a.c(1).b{\tt "} in the HDS container file /home/dsb/mydata.sdf. Note,
         wild cards are not allowed within HDS component paths (i.e. they
         are only allowed within the specification of the container file).

         \sstitem
         If an HDS object is specified which is not an NDF, then the
         object will be searched for NDF components. This search is
         recursive, in that any components of the specified object are also
         searched. The supplied name will be expanded into a group of names,
         one for each NDF found within the specified HDS object. Note, NDFs
         are not themselves searched for other NDFs. That is, the expanded
         group of names will not include any NDF which is contained within
         another NDF (i.e. NDFs which are stored as an extension item of
         another NDF are not included in the group). For instance, if the
         string {\tt "}fred{\tt "} is given, the HDS file fred.sdf will be searched for
         NDFs and the returned group will contain references for all NDFs
         found within fred.sdf.

         \sstitem
         If the environment variable NDF\_FORMATS\_IN is defined (see
         \xref{SSN/20}{ssn20}{}) then only the highest priority file with any give file name
         is included in the returned group. The priority of a file is
         determined by its file type. Native NDFs (.sdf) have highest
         priority. After that, priority decreases along the list of file
         types specified in NDF\_FORMATS\_OUT. If no file type is given by
         the user, the highest priority available file type is used. If an
         explicit file type is given, then that file type is used.

         \sstitem

         Care should be taken if a trailing string enclosed in square
	 brackets is appended to the end of the file name. These are
	 interpreted first as a globbing pattern. Thus {\tt
	 "}fred[12]{\tt "} would match files with base names {\tt
	 "}fred1{\tt "} and {\tt "}fred2{\tt "}. If the pattern does not
	 match any existing files, then the trailing {\tt "}[..]{\tt "}
	 string is next interpreted as a foreign extension specifier.
	 Thus if fred.fit is a multi-extension FITS file, {\tt
	 "}fred[12]{\tt "} would be interpreted as the twelfth image
	 extension in fred.fit only if files cannot be found with
	 basenames {\tt "}fred1{\tt "} or {\tt "}fred2{\tt "}.

         \sstitem
         NDFs contained within HDS files are opened in order to ensure
         that they are valid NDFs. The user is notified if there are no
         valid NDFs matching a supplied name, and they are asked to supply
         a replacement parameter value. No check is made that any foreign
         data files contain valid NDFs since this would involve a potentially
         expensive data conversion. So, for instance, {\tt "}$*$.fit{\tt "} could pick up
         FITS catalogues as well as FITS images. If a foreign data file does
         not contain a valid NDF, an error will be reported when the NDF is
         accessed using NDG\_NDFAS.

         \sstitem
         Each element in the returned group contains a full specification
         for an NDF. Several other groups are created by this routine, and
         are associated with the returned group by means of a GRP {\tt "}owner-slave{\tt "}
         relationship. These supplemental groups are automatically deleted
         when the returned group is deleted using GRP\_DELET. The returned
         group should not be altered using GRP directly because corresponding
         changes may need to be made to the supplemental groups. Routines
         NDG\_SETSZ, NDG\_GTSUP and NDG\_PTSUP are provided to manipulate the
         entire chain of groups. The full chain (starting from the head) is

\section{Routines for accessing NDF Provenance}

This section describes all the functions used for reading, writing,
modifying and querying provenance information in an NDF.

The provenance information in an NDF encapsulates details of all the
other NDFs that were used in the creation of the NDF. The information is
hierarchical and includes parents, grandparents, great-grandparents,
etc., all the way back to ``root ancestors'' (a root ancestor is an ancestor
NDF that has no recorded parents).

On disk, the provenance information is stored in an NDF extension called
``PROVENANCE'' (for details see the section ``The PROVENANCE Extension''
below). The ndgReadProv function reads this information and copies it
into an in-memory structure for faster access. All the other public
functions defined by this module accept an identifier for such an
in-memory structure as their first argument. The ndgWriteProv function
can be used to write the in-memory structure back out to disk as a
PROVENANCE extension in an NDF. The in-memory structure should be freed
when no longer needed, using ndgFreeProv.

\subsection{Functions Provides:}
The following public functions are available. There is an equivalent set
of F77 routines with names formed by converting the C name to upper case
and inserting an underscore after the initial ``NDG'' string (C and F77
versions are - for the most part - documented individually in separate 
prologues below):

\begin{itemize}
   \item  ndgCopyProv: Create a deep copy of a provenance structure.
   \item  ndgBegpv: Begin an NDF provenance block.
   \item  ndgCountProv: Return the number of ancestors in a provenance structure.
   \item  ndgFormatProv: Format all the information in a provenance structure.
   \item  ndgEndpv: End an NDF provenance block.
   \item  ndgFreeProv: Free the resources used by a provenance structure.
   \item  ndgGetProv: Get information about a specific ancestor.
   \item  ndgHideProv: Hide a specific ancestor.
   \item  ndgHltpv: Temporarily stop recording NDFs within a provenance block
   \item  ndgIsHiddenProv: See if an ancestor is hidden.
   \item  ndgModifyProv: Modify information stored for a specific ancestor.
   \item  ndgPutProv: Add a new ancestor NDF into a provenance structure.
   \item  ndgReadProv: Create a new provenance structure by reading a given NDF.
   \item  ndgRemoveProv: Remove ancestors from a provenance structure.
   \item  ndgRootProv: Identify root ancestors in a provenance structure.
   \item  ndgUnhideProv: Ensure an ancestor is not hidden.
   \item  ndgWriteProv: Writes a provenance structure out to an NDF.
\end{itemize}

Note, within a provenance block, it is possible to prevent selected NDFs
receiving provenance by using ndgHltpv (NDG\_HLTPV) to stop the recording
of NDF names before the NDFs are accessed, and then calling ndgHltpv
again afterwards to re-establish the recording of NDF names.

\subsection{The PROVENANCE Extension:}

The PROVENANCE extension in an NDF contains four components: ``PARENTS'',
``ANCESTORS'', ``CREATOR'', ``DATE'' and ``HASH''. The DATE component is a
character string holding the date and time at which the information in
the provenance extension was last modified. The date is UTC formatted by
PSX\_ASCTIME. The ANCESTORS component is a 1D array of ``PROV'' structures
(described below). Each element describes a single NDF that was used in
the creation of the main NDF, either directly or indirectly. The PARENTS
component is a 1D integer array holding the indices within the ANCESTORS
array of the NDFs that are the direct parents of the main NDF. The
CREATOR component holds an arbitrary identifier for the software that
created the main NDF. The HASH component is an integer that identifies
the contents of the current History record in the NDF at the time the
PROVENANCE extension was created. This is used to determine which history
records to copy into the PROVENANCE extension if the main NDF is used in
the creation of another NDF.

Each PROV structure describes a single NDF that was used in the creation
of the main NDF, and can contain the following components; ``PARENTS'',
``DATE'', ``PATH'', ``CREATOR'', ``HISTORY'' and ``MORE''. If present, the PARENTS
component is a 1D integer array holding the the indices within the
ANCESTORS array of the direct parents of the ancestor NDF. If PARENTS is
not present, the ancestor NDF is a ``root'' NDF (that is, it has no known
parents). If present, the DATE component is a string holding the
formatted UTC date at which the provenance information for the ancestor
NDF was determined. If this date is not known, the DATE component will
not be present (this will be the case, for instance, for all root NDFs).
The PATH component will always be present, and is a string holding the
full path to the ancestor NDF. This includes any HDS path within the
container file, but will not include any NDF or HDS section specifier.
Neither will it include the trailing ``.sdf'' suffix. If present, the MORE
component is an arbitrary HDS structure in which any extra information
about the ancestor NDF can be stored. The CREATOR component holds an
arbitrary identifier for the software that created the ancestor NDF. The
HISTORY component is an array of ``HISREC'' structures, each containing a
copy of a single History record from the NDF described by the PROV
structure. Only History records that describe operations performed on the
NDF itself are stored (including the record that describes the creation
of the NDF). That is, History records inherited from the NDF's own
parents are not included.

Each HISREC structure contains the following components (all taken from
the corresponding items in the NDF History record): DATE, COMMAND, USER
and TEXT. If the history record was created by the default NDF history
writing mechanism, the TEXT component will contain a list of environment
parameter values used by (or created by) the corresponding command, and
another statement of the software that performed the action.

      This routine should be called to mark the end of an NDF
      provenance block. The block should have been started by a
      matching call to NDG\_BEGPV. Note, provenance blocks must
      not be nested.

      During a provenance block, a list is maintained of all the 
      existing NDFs that have had their Data array mapped (either in 
      read or update mode) during the block. Another list is maintained 
      of all the NDFs that have been written (either existing NDFs 
      accessed in update mode or new NDFs) during the block.

      When the block ends, the provenance information within each
      NDF in the second may be modified to include all the NDFs in the
      first list as parents. Whether or not this occurs is controlled by
      the AUTOPROV environment variable. If AUTOPROV is set to {\tt '}1{\tt '} then
      the input NDFs are added to the provenance information in the
      output NDF. If AUTOPROV is set to anything other than {\tt '}1{\tt '} then the
      output provenance is not updated. If AUTOPROV is not set at all,
      then the output provenance will be updated only if one or more of
      the input NDFs contains a PROVENANCE extension.

}{
   Format the information in a provenance structure
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine returns an AST KeyMap holding a set of text strings
      containing information taken from the supplied provenance structure.

      The returned KeyMap has an entry with key {\tt "}0{\tt "} that describes the NDF
      from which the provenance was read. It also has an entry describing
      each ancestor NDF. These entries have keys {\tt "}1{\tt "}, {\tt "}2{\tt "}, {\tt "}3{\tt "}, etc, up to
      the number of ancestors in the NDF.

      Each of these entries contains a pointer to another AST KeyMap
      which may contain any subset of the following entries (all of which,
      except for HISTORY, are strings):

      {\tt "}ID{\tt "} - the integer index within the ancestors array (zero for the
             main NDF).

      {\tt "}PATH{\tt "} - The full path or base name for the NDF (see {\tt "}base{\tt "}).

      {\tt "}DATE{\tt "} - The date of creation of the NDF.

      {\tt "}CREATOR{\tt "} - The software item that created the NDF.

      {\tt "}PARENTS{\tt "} - A comma-separated list of indices into the ancestors
             array that identifies the direct parents of the NDF.

      {\tt "}MORE{\tt "} - A summary of the contents of the MORE structure associated
             with the NDF.

      {\tt "}HISTORY{\tt "} - A vector entry holding one or more KeyMaps. Each
             KeyMap contains items that describe an action performed on
             the ancestor. The actions are stored in chronological order
             within the vector entry. The last KeyMap in the vector
             describes the action that created the ancestor NDF. Any
             earlier KeyMaps in the vector describe any subsequent actions
             performed on the ancestor NDF prior to it being used in the
             creation of its parent. Each KeyMap contains the following
             scalar character entries (all taken from the corresponding
             record in the NDF HISTORY component):

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
                {\tt "}DATE{\tt "}: The date and time of the action (e.g. {\tt "}2009-JUN-24
                          14:00:53.752{\tt "} ).

         \sstitem
                {\tt "}COMMAND{\tt "}: An indication of the command that performed the
                          action (e.g. {\tt "}WCSATTRIB (KAPPA 1.10-6){\tt "} ).

         \sstitem
                {\tt "}USER{\tt "}: The user name that performed the action
                          (e.g. {\tt "}dsb{\tt "}).

         \sstitem
                {\tt "}TEXT{\tt "}: The full text of the NDF history record. This is
                          arbitrary, but for NDFs created by Starlink
                          software it will usually include environment
                          parameter values, and the full path of the command
                          that performed the action.

      }
      Finally, the returned KeyMap has an entry with key {\tt "}MXLEN{\tt "} that is
      again a pointer to another KeyMap with the same entries listed
      above (except that it has no {\tt "}HISTORY{\tt "} entry). However, this time
      the entries are integers, not strings, and holds the maximum field
      width used to format the strings.

         The correct recording of history information within the

         within the supplied NDF at the time this function is called,
         describes the creation of the NDF. Very often, an application
         will not itself add any history to the NDF, but will instead
         rely on the automatic recording of default history provided by
         the NDF library. Normally, default history is recorded when the
         NDF is released from the NDF system (e.g. using NDF\_ANNUL or
         NDF\_END). So if this function is called prior to the release of
         the NDF (which it normally will be), then the default history
         information will not yet have been recorded, resulting in
         incorrect information being stored in the PROVENANCE extension.
         For this reason, the WHDEF argument is supplied. If it is set
         to .TRUE., a check is made to see if default history has already
         been stored in the NDF. If .FALSE., default history is stored
         in the NDF before going on to create the PROVENANCE extension.
         Applications that do not use the default history recording
         mechanism, but instead store their own history information,
         should supply .FALSE. for WHDEF, and should also ensure that
         history information has been stored in the NDF before calling
         this routine.

   \sstdescription{
      This function returns an AST KeyMap holding a set of text strings
      containing information taken from the supplied provenance structure.

      The returned KeyMap has an entry with key {\tt "}0{\tt "} that describes the NDF
      from which the provenance was read. It also has an entry describing
      each ancestor NDF. These entries have keys {\tt "}1{\tt "}, {\tt "}2{\tt "}, {\tt "}3{\tt "}, etc, up to
      the number of ancestors in the NDF.

      Each of these entries contains a pointer to another AST KeyMap
      which may contain any subset of the following entries (all of which
      are strings):

      {\tt "}ID{\tt "} - the integer index within the ancestors array (zero for the
             main NDF).

      {\tt "}PATH{\tt "} - The full path or base name for the NDF (see {\tt "}base{\tt "}).

      {\tt "}DATE{\tt "} - The date of creation of the NDF.

      {\tt "}CREATOR{\tt "} - The software item that created the NDF.

      {\tt "}PARENTS{\tt "} - A comma-separated list of indices into the ancestors
             array that identifies the direct parents of the NDF.

      {\tt "}MORE{\tt "} - A summary of the contents of the MORE structure associated
             with the NDF.

      {\tt "}HISTORY{\tt "} - A vector entry holding one or more KeyMaps. Each
             KeyMap contains items that describe an action performed on
             the ancestor. The actions are stored in chronological order
             within the vector entry. The last KeyMap in the vector
             describes the action that created the ancestor NDF. Any
             earlier KeyMaps in the vector describe any subsequent actions
             performed on the ancestor NDF prior to it being used in the
             creation of its parent. Each KeyMap contains the following
             scalar character entries (all taken from the corresponding
             record in the NDF HISTORY component):

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem

         \sstitem

                          (e.g. {\tt "}dsb{\tt "}).

         \sstitem
                {\tt "}TEXT{\tt "}: The full text of the NDF history record. This is
                          arbitrary, but for NDFs created by Starlink
                          software it will usually include environment
                          parameter values, and the full path of the command
                          that performed the action.

         The correct recording of history information within the

         within the supplied NDF at the time this function is called,
         describes the creation of the NDF. Very often, an application
         will not itself add any history to the NDF, but will instead
         rely on the automatic recording of default history provided by
         the NDF library. Normally, default history is recorded when the
         NDF is released from the NDF system (e.g. using ndfAnnul or
         ndfEnd). So if this function is called prior to the release of
         the NDF (which it normally will be), then the default history
         information will not yet have been recorded, resulting in
         incorrect information being stored in the PROVENANCE extension.
         For this reason, the {\tt "}whdef{\tt "} argument is supplied. If it is set

\section{Routines for controling recording of GRP group contents}

The functions described in this section allow the contents of GRP 
groups to be appended to the default history record written by the 
NDF library.

If an ADAM application accesses a parameter as a GRP group, the default
history record added by the NDF library to any output NDFs will include
the group expression supplied in response to the associated parameter
prompt. This is not always very informative - for instance, if the group
expression gives the name of a file from which the group contents are to
be read, rather than giving the group contents directly, then name of the
file will be recorded in the default history record but not the contents
of the file.

The NDG functions described below allow the default history record to be
expanded to include the contents of any GRP group parameters accessed by
the application. The contents of each such group is described in a new
line of text that begings with the string ``Group: <PARAM>='', where
<PARAM> is the name of the parameter with which the group is associated.

There are two parts to using these facilities:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each time a group parameter is accessed, the group must be
``registered'' with NDG using ndgAddgh (NDG\_ADDGH).
\item Before the application accesses any group parameters, it must begin
a ``GRP history'' block by calling ndgBeggh (NDG\_BEGGH). When the
application has finished accessing group parameters, and producing output
NDFs, it should end the GRP history block by calling ndgEndgh (NDG\_ENDGH).
\end{enumerate}

During a GRP history block, a record is kept of all NDFs to which the NDF
library writes default history information. When ndgEndgh is called, the
contents of all groups registered using ndgAddgh within the GRP history
block, are appended to the current history record in each of the NDFs to
which default history has been written.

Note, within a GRP history block, it is possible to prevent selected NDFs
receiving this extra information by using ndgHltgh (NDG\_HLTGH) to stop
the recording of NDF names before the NDFs identifiers are annulled
(which is normally when the default history is written out), and then
calling ndgHltgh again afterwards to re-establish the recording of NDF
names.

The C interfaces are the direct equivalent of the F77 interfaces
described below - convert the F77 name to lower-case, remove the 
underscore and capitalise the following character.

         The group is registered only if the current value of the
         associated parameter contains an {\tt "}INDIRECTION{\tt "} or {\tt "}NAME\_TOKEN{\tt "}
         control character (see SUN/150). This prevents group descriptions
         being added to the NDF history if the contents of the group are
         already described fully by the parameters list.

         \sstitem
         This routine records a copy of the group contents at the time
         this routine is called. Any subsequent changes to the contents of

      Note - GRP NDF history blocks must not be nested.

      not be nested.

      During a GRP NDF history block, application code can register GRP
      groups using routine NDG\_ADDGH. When default history information is
      written to any NDF, a handler routine is called that adds a new
      history record to the NDF for each currently registered GRP group.
      The new history record identifies the ADAM parameter with which the
      group is associated, and lists the contents of the group (as it
      existed at the time the group was registered - any subsequent changes
      to the group contents are ignored).

      current GRP history block.

      In addition, if the GRP history block is halted, this routine will
      ensure that the AUTO\_HISTORY tuning parameter used by the NDF
      library is set to zero, thus preventing the automatic creation of
      History components in any new NDFs. When the block is un-halted
      this tuning parameter is set back to the value it had at the time
      the block was halted.

\section{Changes Introduced in NDG Version 5.8}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Added functions for appending GRP group contents to default
    history records written by the NDF library.
   \item New function ndgHltpv (NDG\_HLTPV) allows selected NDFs to be
    exempted from a provenance block.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes Introduced in NDG Version 5.7}
\begin{itemize}
   \item The Provenance handling API has changed to use a temporary
    in-memory structure to describe a PROVENANCE extension, rather than 
    every function accessing the NDF on disk.
   \item The PROVENANCE extension now allows the recording of NDF History 
    with each ancestor.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes Introduced in NDG Version 5.6}
\begin{itemize}
   \item A new C function ndgRmprvs has been added, that removes multiple
         provenance ancestors from an NDF.
   \item A new C function ndgGtprvk has been added, that returns provenance
         information for a given ancestor in the form of an AST KeyMap.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes Introduced in NDG Version 5.5}
\begin{itemize}
   \item A new routine NDG\_MOREG has been added which searches the
         extensions of a supplied NDF for encapsulated NDFs, appending
         the paths to such NDFs to a supplied GRP group.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes Introduced in NDG Version 5.4}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Added new routines: NDG\_MDPRV.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes Introduced in NDG Version 5.3}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Added routines for storing and retrieving provenance information:
         NDG\_PTPRV, NDG\_RTPRV, NDG\_GTPRV, NDG\_BEGPV and NDG\_ENDPV.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes Introduced in NDG Version 5.2}
\begin{itemize}
   \item The C routine ndg1\_regsb.c has been changed to avoid warning 
         message about "tmpnam" when linking applications on Redhat Linux 
	 systems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes Introduced in NDG Version 5.1}
\begin{itemize}
   \item A new routine NDG\_ASEXP has been added which allows a group of
         existing NDFs to be created from a group expression supplied as 
         a subroutine argument. This is very similar to NDG\_ASSOC except
         that NDG\_ASSOC gets the group expression from the parameter system
         instead of from its argument list.
