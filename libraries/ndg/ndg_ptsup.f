      SUBROUTINE NDG_PTSUP( IGRP, I, FIELDS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG_PTSUP

*  Purpose:
*     Store suplemental information for an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG_PTSUP( IGRP, I, FIELDS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Stores the supplied items of supplemental information for a given 
*     entry in an NDG group. The GRP groups needed to store this
*     supplemental information are created if they do not already exist,
*     and associated with the supplied group by means of a chain of GRP
*     "owner-slave" relationships. They will be deleted automaticaly when
*     the supplied group is deleted using GRP_DELET.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDG group as returned by NDG_ASSOC, etc. This should be the last 
*        group in a GRP owner-slave chain.
*     I = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the required entry.
*     FIELDS( 6 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The supplemental information to be stored with the entry specified
*        by I. Each element of the supplied array should contain the 
*        following:
*           1 - NDF slice specification (if any)
*           2 - HDS path (if any)
*           3 - File type
*           4 - Base file name
*           5 - Directory path
*           6 - Full NDF specification 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
