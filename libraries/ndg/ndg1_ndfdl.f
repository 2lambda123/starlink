      SUBROUTINE NDG1_NDFDL( LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG1_NDFDL

*  Purpose:
*     Delete all NDFs within an HDS object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG1_NDFDL( LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied HDS object is searched for NDFs, and any NDFs which
*     are found are deleted. Here, an NDF is defined as an HDS structure 
*     containing a component called DATA_ARRAY which can be accessed by the
*     ARY library.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The locator to the object to be searched for NDFs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
