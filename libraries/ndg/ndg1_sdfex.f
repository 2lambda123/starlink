*  Name:
*     NDG1_SDFEX

*  Purpose:
*     Searches for NDFs within an HDS object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG1_SDFEX( IGRP1, RECURS, IGRPD, IGRPB, IGRPT, IGRPH, IGRPS, 
*                      LOC, DIR, NAM, TYP, SLICE, FOUND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied HDS object is searched for NDFs, and the paths to any 
*     NDFs found within it are appended to the end of group IGRP.
*     Here, an NDF is defined as an HDS structure containing a component 
*     called DATA_ARRAY which can be accessed by the ARY library.

*     Note, if RECURS is .FALSE., only NDFs stored explicitly within the 
*     supplied object are included in the returned group (i.e. NDFs within 
*     sub-components are ignored).
*
*     The supplied fields are stored in the other groups for each found
*     NDF.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group to which the NDF paths should
*        be appended.
*     RECURS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Indicates if the search should recurse through each structure to 
*        find all NDFs within the supplied object, no matter where they 
*        are located. If RECUR is .TRUE. the returned paths in IGRP are 
*        ordered by depth within the supplied structure. The NDFs near 
*        the top of the structure come before those lower down in the 
*        structure.
*     IGRPD = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group to which the directory field for each 
*        NDF found should be appended.
*     IGRPB = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group to which the file base name for each 
*        NDF found should be appended.
*     IGRPT = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group to which the file type for each 
*        NDF found should be appended.
*     IGRPH = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group to which the HDS component path for 
*        each NDF found should be appended.
*     IGRPS = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group to which the NDF slice specification 
*        for each NDF found should be appended.
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The locator to the object to be searched for NDFs.
*     DIR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The directory field to store in IGRPD.
*     NAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The filer base name field to store in IGRPB.
*     TYP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The file type field to store in IGRPT.
*     SLICE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An NDF slice specification to append to the path of each NDF
*        found in the supplied object. This is stored in IGRPS (but not
*        IGRPH).
*     FOUND = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Returned .TRUE. if one or more NDFs were found in the supplied
*        object. Returned unchanged otherwise.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     15-FEB-1999 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     21-DEC-1999 (DSB):
*        Changed to remove recursive searching through components of the
*        supplied object. Only NDFs stored directly within the supplied
*        object are now returned.
*     2-APR-2001 (DSB):
*        Changed definition of an NDF to "an HDS structure containing
*        a component called DATA_ARRAY which can be accessed by the ARY
*        library".
*     12-FEB-2009 (DSB):
*        Added argument RECURS.
