      SUBROUTINE NDG1_NDFCH( VERB, IGRP1, START, IGRP2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG1_NDFCH

*  Purpose:
*     Expand wild card templates, etc, and check all NDFs exist.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG1_NDFCH( VERB, IGRP1, START, IGRP2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Names stored in the supplied group with indices greater than or
*     equal to START are expanded into a list of explicit file names
*     which can be accessed as NDFs, either directly or using the
*     NDF on-the-fly conversion system. The expanded set of names are 
*     appended to the end of the group, and the original names are deleted.
*
*     If any of the files in the group cannot be accessed, an error is
*     reported and STATUS is returned equal to NDG__NOFIL. If this
*     happens the name of each bad file is stoed in IGRP2.

*  Arguments:
*     VERB = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If TRUE then errors which occur whilst accessing supplied NDFs
*        are flushed so that the user can see them before re-prompting for
*        a new NDF ("verbose" mode). Otherwise, they are annulled and 
*        a general "Cannot access file xyz" message is displayed before 
*        re-prompting.
*     IGRP1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group containing the NDF names
*        (potentially containing wild cards).
*     START = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the first name to be expanded into a list of NDF
*        files.
*     IGRP2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for a group in which to store any supplied names
*        for which no corresponding NDFs could be found. This may be 
*        GRP__NOID in which case the names of bad NDFs are discarded.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*    -  The order of the names is preserved. 
*    -  If an input name contained an NDF slice specification, it is 
*    copied to all related output file names.
*    -  Native (.sdf) files are returned without a file type.
