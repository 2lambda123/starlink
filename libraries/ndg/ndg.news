1 NDG_library

Version 5.9

   o  NDG now uses its own facility code in the Starlink error message
   system. This means that the constants defined in NDG_ERR have been
   changed so any software using this file needs to be rebuilt.

   o  Change internal usage of ONE_FIND_FILE to PSX_WORDEXP.
   This stops the program from forking when expanding the wildcards
   and shell meta characters. Forking can be problematic when a
   lot of memory is in use.

Version 5.8
   o  Added functions for appending GRP group contents to default
   history records written by the NDF library.

   o  New function ndgHltpv (NDG_HLTPV) allows selected NDFs to be
   exempted from a provenance block.

Version 5.7
   o The entire API for provenance handling has been re-written.

   o Provenance can now store NDF history.

Version 5.6

   o A new C function ndgRmprvs has been added, that removes multiple
   provenance ancestors from an NDF.

   o A new C function ndgGtprvk has been added, that returns provenance
   information for a given ancestor in the form of an AST KeyMap.

Version 5.5

   o A new routine NDG_MOREG has been added which searchs the
   extensions of a supplied NDF for encapsulated NDFs, appending
   the paths to such NDFs to a supplied GRP group.

Version 5.3

   o New routines for accessing provenance information within NDFs;
   NDG_GTPRV, NDG_RTPRV, NDG_PTPRV, NDG_BEGPV and NDG_ENDPV.

   o  New routine NDG_COPY copies a group created by NDG, including the
   sumplemental information stored in associated groups.

   o  New routine NDG_CREXP expands a supplied group expression into a
   list of names of NDFs to be created.

Version 5.2-3

   o Released under the GPL

Version 5.2-2

Version 5.2-2 of the NDG library (a library of fortran subroutines for
accessing groups of NDFs) has been released.

   o Added NDG_NDFCO which allows an output NDF to be created by copying
     an input NDF.
