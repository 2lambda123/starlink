1 NDG_library

NDG is a library of subroutines for processing groups of NDFs within
Starlink applications. Groups of existing NDFs may be specified using 
lists, wild-cards or by reading text file. Groups of output NDFs may be
specified by editing each name in a corresponding group of input NDFs.
NDFs within HDS container files, and within foreign format files may be
accessed.
