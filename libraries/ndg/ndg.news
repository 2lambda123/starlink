1 NDG_library

Version 5.1 of the NDG library (a library of fortran subroutines for
accessing groups of NDFs) has been released. 

   o A new routine NDG_ASEXP has been added which allows a group of
     existing NDFs to be created from a group expression supplied as a
     subroutine argument. This is very similar to NDG_ASSOC except that
     NDG_ASSOC gets the group expression from the parameter system
     instead of from its argument list.
