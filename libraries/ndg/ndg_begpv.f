      SUBROUTINE NDG_BEGPV( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG_BEGPV

*  Purpose:
*     Begin an NDF provenance block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG_BEGPV( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine should be called to mark the start of an NDF 
*     provenance block. The block should be ended by a matching 
*     call to NDG_ENDPV. See NDG_ENDPV for more details.
*
*     Note - provenance blocks must not be nested.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     31-OCT-2007 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     2-JUN-2008 (DSB):
*        Use a pair of AST KeyMaps to hold the NDF names rather than a
*        pair of GRP groups (avoids the need to purgew duplicate NDF
*        names, which can be very slow for large numbers of NDFs).
*     1-SEP-2008 (DSB):
*        Create a KeyMap to hold the names of the mapped input NDFs.

*  Global Variables:

*  Check the inherited global status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  Indicate that NDF event handlers needed to record the NDFs in which
*  provenance should be stored have not yet been established, and then
*  establish them. 
      STATE_COM1 = .FALSE.
      CALL NDG_HLTPV( .TRUE., OLD, STATUS )

*  Indicate that the PROVENANCE extension should not be propagated by
*  default when NDF_PROP or NDF_SCOPY is called.
      CALL NDF_TUNE( 0, 'PXTPROVENANCE', STATUS )

*  Create a AST KeyMap to hold the paths to the NDFs that are read during 
*  the provenance block. Each KeyMap entry has a key that is an NDF name
*  (the entry value is of no significance and will be set arbitrarily to 
*  zero).
      RDKMP_COM1 = AST_KEYMAP( ' ', STATUS )

*  Create a AST KeyMap to hold the paths to the NDFs that are written during 
*  the provenance block.
      WRKMP_COM1 = AST_KEYMAP( ' ', STATUS )

*  Create a AST KeyMap to hold the paths to the NDFs that have their Data
*  array mapped for read or update access.
      MPKMP_COM1 = AST_KEYMAP( ' ', STATUS )
