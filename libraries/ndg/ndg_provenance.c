/*
*  Name:
*     ndg_provenance.c

*  Purpose:
*     Provides functions for handling NDF provenance information.

*  Type of Module:
*     C source file.

*  Description:
*     This file defines all the functions used for reading, writing,
*     modifying and querying provenance information in an NDF.
*
*     The provenance information in an NDF encapsulates details of all
*     the other NDFs that were used in the creation of the NDF. The
*     information is heirarchical and includes parents, grandparents,
*     great-grandparents, etc., all the way back to "root ancestors" (a
*     root ancestor is an ancestor NDF that has no recorded parents).
*
*     On disk, the provenance information is stored in an NDF extension
*     called "PROVENANCE" (for details see the section "The PROVENANCE
*     Extension" below). The ndgReadProv function reads this information
*     and copies it into an in-memory structure for faster access. All the
*     other public functions defined by this module accept an identifier
*     for such an in-memory structure as their first argument. The
*     ndgWriteProv function can be used to write the in-memory structure
*     back out to disk as a PROVENANCE extension in an NDF. The in-memory
*     structure should be freed when no longer needed, using ndgFreeProv.

*  Functions Provides:
*     This modules provides the following public functions. There is an
*     equivalent set of F77 routines with names formed by converting the
*     C name to upper case and inserting an underscore after the initial
*     "NDG" string (C and F77 versions are documented individually in
*     separate prologues below):
*
*     - ndgCopyProv: Create a deep copy of a provenance structure.
*     - ndgCountProv: Return the number of ancestors in a provenance structure.
*     - ndgFormatProv: Format all the information in a provenance structure.
*     - ndgFreeProv: Free the resources used by a provenance structure.
*     - ndgGetProv: Get information about a specific ancestor.
*     - ndgHideProv: Hide a specific ancestor.
*     - ndgIsHiddenProv: See if an ancestor is hidden.
*     - ndgModifyProv: Modify information stored for a specific ancestor.
*     - ndgPutProv: Add a new ancestor NDF into a provenance structure.
*     - ndgReadProv: Create a new provenance structure by reading a given NDF.
*     - ndgReadVotProv: Create a new provenance structure from a VOTABLE.
*     - ndgRemoveProv: Remove ancestors from a provenance structure.
*     - ndgRootProv: Identify root ancestors in a provenance structure.
*     - ndgUnhideProv: Ensure an ancestor is not hidden.
*     - ndgWriteProv: Writes a provenance structure out to an NDF.
*     - ndgWriteVotProv: Writes a provenance structure out to a VOTABLE.

*  The PROVENANCE Extension:
*     - The PROVENANCE extension in an NDF contains four components:
*     "PARENTS", "ANCESTORS", "CREATOR", "DATE" and "HASH". The DATE
*     component is a character string holding the date and time at which the
*     information in the provenance extension was last modified. The date is
*     UTC formatted by PSX_ASCTIME. The ANCESTORS component is a 1D array
*     of "PROV" structures (described below). Each element describes a
*     single NDF that was used in the creation of the main NDF, either
*     directly or indirectly. The PARENTS component is a 1D integer
*     array holding the indices within the ANCESTORS array of the NDFs
*     that are the direct parents of the main NDF. The CREATOR component
*     holds an arbitrary identifier for the software that created the
*     main NDF. The HASH component is an integer that identifies the
*     contents of the current History record in the NDF at the time the
*     PROVENANCE extension was created. This is used to determine which
*     history records to copy into the PROVENANCE extension if the main
*     NDF is used in the creation of another NDF.
*     - Each PROV structure describes a single NDF that was used in the
*     creation of the main NDF, and can contain the following components;
*     "PARENTS", "DATE", "PATH", "CREATOR", "HISTORY" and "MORE". If present,
*     the PARENTS component is a 1D integer array holding the the indices
*     within the ANCESTORS array of the direct parents of the ancestor NDF.
*     If PARENTS is not present, the ancestor NDF is a "root" NDF (that is,
*     it has no known parents). If present, the DATE component is a string
*     holding the formatted UTC date at which the provenance information for
*     the ancestor NDF was determined. If this date is not known, the DATE
*     component will not be present (this will be the case, for instance, for
*     all root NDFs). The PATH component will always be present, and is a
*     string holding the full path to the ancestor NDF. This includes any HDS
*     path within the container file, but will not include any NDF or HDS
*     section specifier. Neither will it include the trailing ".sdf" suffix.
*     If present, the MORE component is an arbitrary HDS structure in which
*     any extra information about the ancestor NDF can be stored. The
*     CREATOR component holds an arbitrary identifier for the software that
*     created the ancestor NDF. The HISTORY component is an array of "HISREC"
*     structures, each containing a copy of a single History record from
*     the NDF described by the PROV structure. Only History records that
*     describe operations performed on the NDF itself are stored (including
*     the record that describes the creation of the NDF). That is, History
*     records inherited from the NDF's own parents are not included.
*     - Each HISREC structure contains the following components (all
*     taken from the corresponding items in the NDF History record):
*     DATE, COMMAND, USER and TEXT. If the history record was created by
*     the default NDF history writing mechanism, the TEXT component will
*     contain a list of environment parameter values used by (or created
*     by) the corresponding command, and another statement of the
*     software that performed the action.

*  History:
*     20-JUN-2009 (DSB):
*        Original version, based on earlier provenance module. All public
*        function names have been changed, and they now use AST KeyMaps
*        rather than HDS structures for communicating provenance
*        information, (except that an HDS locator is still used for the
*        MORE component). Also, each ancestor in the PROVENANCE extension
*        now stores NDF history information that is speciifc to that
*        ancestor.
*     6-JUL-2009 (DSB):
*        Added facility for flagging ancestors as hidden, and producing a
*        deep copy of a Provenance structure.
*     20-JUL-2009 (DSB):
*        Added ndgWriteVotProv and ndgReadVotProv.
*     13-FEB-2010 (DSB):
*        Do not purge duplicate entries before leaving ndg1Rmprv, as
*        removing any such entries would upset subsequent ancestor indexing.
*     15-FEB-2010 (DSB):
*        - Purge duplicate entries before leaving ndgModifyProv.
*        - Report an error if inconsitent entries for the same ancestor
*        are found within a provenance structure.
*     13-APR-2010 (DSB):
*        - Modify ndg1TheSame so that CREATOR must match (in addition to
*        PATH and DATE) for two Prov structures to be considered the same.
*        - Remove trailing white space.
*      28-MAY-2010 (DSB):
*        Change ndg1TheSame to include checks on sameness of all ancestors.
*      21-JUN-2010 (DSB):
*         - Save calculated ProvId value in the Prov structure to avoid 
*         recalculating it each time it is needed.
*         - Indicate that the ProvId value in a Prov is stale out of date
*         when the list of parents in the Prov is changed.

*  Description:
*     This routine returns an AST KeyMap holding a set of text strings
*     containing information taken from the supplied provenance structure.
*
*     The returned KeyMap has an entry with key "0" that describes the NDF
*     from which the provenance was read. It also has an entry describing
*     each ancestor NDF. These entries have keys "1", "2", "3", etc, up to
*     the number of ancestors in the NDF.
*
*     Each of these entries contains a pointer to another AST KeyMap
*     which may contain any subset of the following entries (all of which,
*     except for HISTORY, are strings):
*
*     "ID" - the integer index within the ancestors array (zero for the
*            main NDF).
*
*     "PATH" - The full path or base name for the NDF (see "base").
*
*     "DATE" - The date of creation of the NDF.
*
*     "CREATOR" - The software item that created the NDF.
*
*     "PARENTS" - A comma-separated list of indices into the ancestors
*            array that identifies the direct parents of the NDF.
*
*     "MORE" - A summary of the contents of the MORE structure associated
*            with the NDF.
*
*     "HISTORY" - A vector entry holding one or more KeyMaps. Each
*            KeyMap contains items that describe an action performed on
*            the ancestor. The actions are stored in chronological order
*            within the vector entry. The last KeyMap in the vector
*            describes the action that created the ancestor NDF. Any
*            earlier KeyMaps in the vector describe any subsequent actions
*            performed on the ancestor NDF prior to it being used in the
*            creation of its parent. Each KeyMap contains the following
*            scalar character entries (all taken from the corresponding
*            record in the NDF HISTORY component):
*
*            - "DATE": The date and time of the action (e.g. "2009-JUN-24
*                      14:00:53.752" ).
*            - "COMMAND": An indication of the command that performed the
*                      action (e.g. "WCSATTRIB (KAPPA 1.10-6)" ).
*            - "USER": The user name that performed the action
*                      (e.g. "dsb").
*            - "TEXT": The full text of the NDF history record. This is
*                      arbitrary, but for NDFs created by Starlink
*                      software it will usually include environment
*                      parameter values, and the full path of the command
*                      that performed the action.
*
*     Finally, the returned KeyMap has an entry with key "MXLEN" that is
*     again a pointer to another KeyMap with the same entries listed
*     above (except that it has no "HISTORY" entry). However, this time
*     the entries are integers, not strings, and holds the maximum field
*     width used to format the strings.

*  Arguments:
*     IPROV = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for a structure holding the provenance information
*        read from an NDF, as returned by NDG_READPROV.
*     BASE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., then the PATH field in the returned KeyMap holds the
*        base name of each NDF rather than the full path.
*     KEYMAP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to the returned AST KeyMap.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Arguments:
*     IPROV = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for a structure holding the provenance information
*        read from an NDF, as returned by NDG_READPROV.
*     IANC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the ancestor NDF for which information should be
*        returned. A value of zero will result in information being returned
*        that describes the NDF from which the provenance information was
*        read. Otherwise, the IANC value is used as an index into the
*        ANCESTORS array. No error is reported if IANC is too large, but a
*        null identifier will be returned as the function value.
*     KM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to an AST KeyMap containing entries with the following
*        keys and values:
*
*        - "PATH": A string holding the path of the ancestor NDF.
*        - "DATE": A string holding the formatted UTC date and time at
*          which the provenance information for the ancestor NDF was
*          recorded.
*        - "CREATOR": A string identifying the software that created the
*          ancestor NDF.
*        - "PARENTS": A 1D vector of integers that are the indices of the
*          immediate parents of the ancestor.
*        - "MORE": A KeyMap containing any scalar or vector primitive
*          values stored at the top level of the associated HDS MORE
*          structure. The HDS name of the component is used as the key.
*          The full contents of the MORE structure are returned by the
*          MORE argument (see above).
*        - "HISTORY": A vector entry holding one or more KeyMaps. Each
*          KeyMap contains items that describe an action performed on
*          the ancestor. The actions are stored in chronological order
*          within the vector entry. The last KeyMap in the vector
*          describes the action that created the ancestor NDF. Any
*          earlier KeyMaps in the vector describe any subsequent actions
*          performed on the ancestor NDF prior to it being used in the
*          creation of its parent. Each KeyMap contains the following
*          scalar character entries (all taken from the corresponding
*          record in the NDF HISTORY component):
*          - "DATE": The date and time of the action (e.g. "2009-JUN-24
*            14:00:53.752" ).
*          - "COMMAND": An indication of the command that performed the
*            action (e.g. "WCSATTRIB (KAPPA 1.10-6)" ).
*          - "USER": The user name that performed the action (e.g. "dsb").
*          - "TEXT": The full text of the NDF history record. This is
*            arbitrary, but for NDFs created by Starlink software it will
*            usually include environment parameter values, and the full
*            path of the command that performed the action.
*
*        If the specified ancestor does not have any of these items of
*        information, then the corresponding entry will not be present
*        in the returned KeyMap. For instance, if the ancestor has no
*        immediate parent NDFs, then the "PARENTS" entry will not be
*        present in the KeyMap. A NULL pointer will be returned if the
*        NDF has no provenance extension, or if "ianc" is outside the
*        bounds of the ANCESTORS array (and is not zero). The returned
*        KeyMap pointer should be annulled when it is no longer needed,
*        either by calling astAnnul explicitly, or by relying on astEnd
*        to annul it (together with all the other AST Objects created in
*        the current AST Object context).

*        requested ancestor. The returned locator should be annulled using
*        DAT_ANNUL when no longer needed. A value of DAT__NOLOC will be

*        the returned object will be assigned an arbitrary HDS Name, which
*        will not in general be "MORE".

*  Name:
*     NDG_WRITEPROV

*  Purpose:
*     Write provenance information to an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C (callable from Fortran)

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG_WRITEPROV( IPROV, INDF, WHDEF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine writes the contents of the supplied provenance
*     structure out to a given NDF, replacing any existing provenance
*     information in the NDF.

*  Arguments:
*     IPROV = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for a structure holding the provenance information
*        read from an NDF, as returned by NDG_READPROV.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier for the NDF in which to store the provenance
*        information.
*     WHDEF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The correct recording of history information within the
*        PROVENANCE extension requires that the current history record
*        within the supplied NDF at the time this function is called,
*        describes the creation of the NDF. Very often, an application
*        will not itself add any history to the NDF, but will instead
*        rely on the automatic recording of default history provided by
*        the NDF library. Normally, default history is recorded when the
*        NDF is released from the NDF system (e.g. using NDF_ANNUL or
*        NDF_END). So if this function is called prior to the release of
*        the NDF (which it normally will be), then the default history
*        information will not yet have been recorded, resulting in
*        incorrect information being stored in the PROVENANCE extension.
*        For this reason, the WHDEF argument is supplied. If it is set
*        to .TRUE., a check is made to see if default history has already
*        been stored in the NDF. If .FALSE., default history is stored
*        in the NDF before going on to create the PROVENANCE extension.
*        Applications that do not use the default history recording
*        mechanism, but instead store their own history information,
*        should supply .FALSE. for WHDEF, and should also ensure that
*        history information has been stored in the NDF before calling
*        this routine.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This function returns an AST KeyMap holding a set of text strings
*     containing information taken from the supplied provenance structure.
*
*     The returned KeyMap has an entry with key "0" that describes the NDF
*     from which the provenance was read. It also has an entry describing
*     each ancestor NDF. These entries have keys "1", "2", "3", etc, up to
*     the number of ancestors in the NDF.
*
*     Each of these entries contains a pointer to another AST KeyMap
*     which may contain any subset of the following entries (all of which
*     are strings):
*
*     "ID" - the integer index within the ancestors array (zero for the
*            main NDF).
*
*     "PATH" - The full path or base name for the NDF (see "base").
*
*     "DATE" - The date of creation of the NDF.
*
*     "CREATOR" - The software item that created the NDF.
*
*     "PARENTS" - A comma-separated list of indices into the ancestors
*            array that identifies the direct parents of the NDF.
*
*     "MORE" - A summary of the contents of the MORE structure associated
*            with the NDF.
*
*     "HISTORY" - A vector entry holding one or more KeyMaps. Each
*            KeyMap contains items that describe an action performed on
*            the ancestor. The actions are stored in chronological order
*            within the vector entry. The last KeyMap in the vector
*            describes the action that created the ancestor NDF. Any
*            earlier KeyMaps in the vector describe any subsequent actions
*            performed on the ancestor NDF prior to it being used in the
*            creation of its parent. Each KeyMap contains the following
*            scalar character entries (all taken from the corresponding
*            record in the NDF HISTORY component):
*
*            - "DATE": The date and time of the action (e.g. "2009-JUN-24
*                      14:00:53.752" ).
*            - "COMMAND": An indication of the command that performed the
*                      action (e.g. "WCSATTRIB (KAPPA 1.10-6)" ).
*            - "USER": The user name that performed the action
*                      (e.g. "dsb").
*            - "TEXT": The full text of the NDF history record. This is
*                      arbitrary, but for NDFs created by Starlink
*                      software it will usually include environment
*                      parameter values, and the full path of the command
*                      that performed the action.
*
*     Finally, the returned KeyMap has an entry with key "MXLEN" that is
*     again a pointer to another KeyMap with the same entries listed
*     above (except that it has no "HISTORY" entry). However, this time
*     the entries are integers, not strings, and holds the maximum field
*     width used to format the strings.

*  Arguments:
*     prov
*        An identifier for a structure holding the provenance information
*        as returned by ndgReadProv or ndgReadVotProv.
*     base
*        If non-zero, then the PATH field in the returned KeyMap holds the
*        base name of each NDF rather than the full path.
*     keymap
*        A location at which to returned a pointer to the returned AST KeyMap.
*     status

*        The index of the ancestor NDF for which information should be

*        that describes the NDF from which the provenance information was
*        read. Otherwise, the "ianc" value is used as an index into the

*        temporary HDS object containing a full deep copy of the MORE
*        structure associated with the requested ancestor. The
*        returned locator should be annulled using datAnnul when no
*        longer needed. A NULL pointer may be supplied for this argument
*        if the MORE structure is not needed. A NULL pointer will be
*        returned if the requested ancestor has no MORE component. Note,
*        the returned object will be assigned an arbitrary HDS Name,
*        which will not in general be "MORE".
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to an AST KeyMap containing entries with the following
*     keys and values:
*
*     - "PATH": A string holding the path of the ancestor NDF.
*     - "DATE": A string holding the formatted UTC date and time at
*       which the provenance information for the ancestor NDF was
*       recorded.
*     - "CREATOR": A string identifying the software that created the
*       ancestor NDF.
*     - "PARENTS": A 1D vector of integers that are the indices of
*       the immediate parents of the ancestor.
*     - "MORE": A KeyMap containing any scalar or vector primitive
*       values stored at the top level of the associated HDS MORE
*       structure. The HDS name of the component is used as the key.
*       The full contents of the MORE structure are returned by the
*       "more" argument (see above).
*     - "HISTORY": A vector entry holding one or more KeyMaps. Each
*       KeyMap contains items that describe an action performed on
*       the ancestor. The actions are stored in chronological order
*       within the vector entry. The last KeyMap in the vector
*       describes the action that created the ancestor NDF. Any
*       earlier KeyMaps in the vector describe any subsequent actions
*       performed on the ancestor NDF prior to it being used in the
*       creation of its parent. Each KeyMap contains the following
*       scalar character entries (all taken from the corresponding
*       record in the NDF HISTORY component):
*       - "DATE": The date and time of the action (e.g. "2009-JUN-24
*         14:00:53.752" ).
*       - "COMMAND": An indication of the command that performed the
*         action (e.g. "WCSATTRIB (KAPPA 1.10-6)" ).
*       - "USER": The user name that performed the action (e.g. "dsb").
*       - "TEXT": The full text of the NDF history record. This is
*         arbitrary, but for NDFs created by Starlink software it will
*         usually include environment parameter values, and the full
*         path of the command that performed the action.
*
*     If the specified ancestor does not have any of these items of
*     information, then the corresponding entry will not be present
*     in the returned KeyMap. For instance, if the ancestor has no
*     immediate parent NDFs, then the "PARENTS" entry will not be
*     present in the KeyMap. A NULL pointer will be returned if the
*     NDF has no provenance extension, or if "ianc" is outside the
*     bounds of the ANCESTORS array (and is not zero). The returned
*     KeyMap pointer should be annulled when it is no longer needed,
*     either by calling astAnnul explicitly, or by relying on astEnd
*     to annul it (together with all the other AST Objects created in
*     the current AST Object context).

*     km
*        A pointer to an AST KeyMap containing the values to store. Entries
*        with the following keys are recognised:
*
*        - "PATH": A string holding the path of the ancestor NDF.
*        - "DATE": A string holding the formatted UTC date and time at
*          which the provenance information for the ancestor NDF was
*          recorded.
*        - "CREATOR": A string identifying the software that created the
*          ancestor NDF.
*        - "MORE": A KeyMap containing extra information to store at the
*        top level of the MORE component for the ancestor. Only entries
*        holding primitive data values (scalar or vector) are used -
*        entries holding nested KeyMaps, etc, are ignored. If an entry in
*        this KeyMap has the same name as a component in the supplied
*        "more" HDS structure, then the KeyMap value is used in preference

*        corresponding item of information will be deleted from the
*        provenance extension. To delete the "MORE" component in the
*        provenance extension, supply a KeyMap without a MORE entry, and
*        also supply DAT_NOLOC for the "more" argument. An error is
*        reported if the supplied KeyMap has no "PATH" entry. Note, the

*     information in the NDF.

*  Arguments:
*     prov
*        A pointer to the provenance information to be written out.
*     indf
*        Identifier for the NDF in which to store the provenance
*        information.
*     whdef
*        The correct recording of history information within the
*        PROVENANCE extension requires that the current history record
*        within the supplied NDF at the time this function is called,
*        describes the creation of the NDF. Very often, an application
*        will not itself add any history to the NDF, but will instead
*        rely on the automatic recording of default history provided by
*        the NDF library. Normally, default history is recorded when the
*        NDF is released from the NDF system (e.g. using ndfAnnul or
*        ndfEnd). So if this function is called prior to the release of
*        the NDF (which it normally will be), then the default history
*        information will not yet have been recorded, resulting in
*        incorrect information being stored in the PROVENANCE extension.
*        For this reason, the "whdef" argument is supplied. If it is set
*        to a non-zero value, a check is made to see if default history
*        has already been stored in the NDF. If not, default history is
*        stored in the NDF before going on to create the PROVENANCE
*        extension. Applications that do not use the default history
*        recording mechanism, but instead store their own history
*        information, should supply a zero value for "whdef" and should
*        also ensure that history information has been stored in the NDF
*        before calling this function.

*                    array that identifies the direct parents of the NDF.
*
*        "MORE" - A summary of the contents of the MORE structure associated
*                 with the NDF.
*
*        "HISTORY" - A vector entry holding one or more KeyMaps. Each
*               KeyMap contains items that describe an action performed
*               on the ancestor. The actions are stored in chronological
*               order within the vector entry. The last KeyMap in the
*               vector describes the action that created the ancestor NDF.
*               Any earlier KeyMaps in the vector describe any subsequent
*               actions performed on the ancestor NDF prior to it being
*               used in the creation of its parent. Each KeyMap contains

*
*               - "DATE": The date and time of the action
*                         (e.g. "2009-JUN-24 14:00:53.752" ).
*               - "COMMAND": An indication of the command that performed
*                         the action (e.g. "WCSATTRIB (KAPPA 1.10-6)" ).
*               - "USER": The user name that performed the action
*                         (e.g. "dsb").
*               - "TEXT": The full text of the NDF history record. This is
*                         arbitrary, but for NDFs created by Starlink
*                         software it will usually include environment
*                         parameter values, and the full path of the
*                         command that performed the action.
*
*     A key will be missing in the returned KeyMap if the Provenance
*     structure does not contain that item.

*  Arguments:
*     provenance
*        Pointer to the Provenance structure that contains the Prov
*        structure that is to be formatted.
*     i
*        The index of the Prov structure to be formatted within the
*        supplied Provenance structure.
*     base
*        If non-zero, then the PATH field in the returned KeyMap holds the
*        base name of each NDF rather than the full path.
*     mxlenkey
*        Pointer to an existing KeyMap. On exit it will contain an entry
*        for each of the keys listed under "Description:" above (except
*        it will not have a "HISTORY" entry). All entries will be be
*        scalar integers. Each integer value is updated by this function
*        so that it holds the larger of the supplied value and the field
*        width used to format the corresponding item in the returned
*        KeyMap. The supplied value is left unchanged if the returned
*        KeyMap does not contain a value.
*     status

*        An HDS structure holding provenance information. Can be NULL.
*     npath
*        The path of the NDF from which the provenance was read.
*     more
*        An optional HDS structure holding additional information. This is
*        stored in the main Prov structure in the returned Provenance.
*     more2
*        An optional KeyMap holding additional primitive (scalar or vector)
*        information. This is added into the HDS structure specified by
*        "more", over-writing any components with the same names.
*     creator
*        An optional text string to be stored as the "creator" string in
*        the returned Prov structure. This is only used if the supplied
*        provenance has no creator string.
*     isroot
*        If non-zero, then the NDF is treated like a root NDF (that is,
*        information about any parents in the provenance information for
*        the NDF is ignored, and it is assumed the NDF has no parents).
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Description:
*     This function allocates dynamic memory to hold a new Provenance
*     structure, and copies provenance information from the PROVENANCE

*     If the NDF does not have a PROVENANCE extension, then the returned

*  Arguments:
*     indf
*        The NDF identifier.
*     more
*        An optional HDS structure holding additional information about
*        the NDF. This is stored in the main Prov structure in the
*        returned Provenance.
*     more2
*        An optional KeyMap holding additional primitive (scalar or vector)
*        information about the NDF. This is added into the HDS structure
*        specified by "more", over-writing any components with the same
*        names.
*     creator
*        An optional text string to be stored as the "creator" string in
*        the returned Prov structure. This is only used if the supplied
*        NDF has no creator string in its provenance.
*     isroot
*        If non-zero, then the NDF is treated like a root NDF (that is,
*        information about any parents in the provenance information for
*        the NDF is ignored, and it is assumed the NDF has no parents).
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Description:
*     This function erases any existing PROVENANCE extension within the
*     supplied NDF, and creates a new one holding the information in the
*     supplied Provenance structure.

*  Arguments:
*     provenance
*        The Provenance structure.
*     indf
*        The NDF identifier.
*     whdef
*        The correct recording of history information within the
*        PROVENANCE extension requires that the current history record
*        within the supplied NDF at the time this function is called,
*        describes the creation of the NDF. Very often, an application
*        will not itself add any history to the NDF, but will instead
*        rely on the automatic recording of default history provided by
*        the NDF library. Normally, default history is recorded when the
*        NDF is released from the NDF system (e.g. using ndfAnnul or
*        ndfEnd). So if this function is called prior to the release of
*        the NDF (which it normally will be), then the default history
*        information will not yet have been recorded, resulting in
*        incorrect information being stored in the PROVENANCE extension.
*        For this reason, the "whdef" argument is supplied. If it is set
*        to a non-zero value, a check is made to see if default history
*        has already been stored in the NDF. If not, default history is
*        stored in the NDF before going on to create the PROVENANCE
*        extension. Applications that do not use the default history
*        recording mechanism, but instead store their own history
*        information, should supply a zero value for "whdef" and should
*        also ensure that history information has been stored in the NDF
*        before calling this function.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.
