      SUBROUTINE NDG_ASSOC( PARAM, VERB, IGRP, SIZE, FLAG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG_ASSOC

*  Purpose:
*     Store names of existing NDFs specified through the environment.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG_ASSOC( PARAM, VERB, IGRP, SIZE, FLAG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A group expression is obtained from the environment using the
*     supplied parameter. The expression is parsed (using the
*     facilities of the GRP routine GRP_GROUP, see SUN/150) to produce
*     a list of explicit names for existing NDFs which are appended to the 
*     end of the supplied group (a new group is created if none is
*     supplied). If an error occurs while parsing the group expression, the 
*     user is re-prompted for a new group expression. NDF identifiers for
*     particular members of the group can be obtained using NDG_NDFAS.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The parameter with which to associate the group expression.
*     VERB = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If TRUE then errors which occur whilst accessing supplied NDFs
*        are flushed so that the user can see them before re-prompting for
*        a new NDF ("verbose" mode). Otherwise, they are annulled and 
*        a general "Cannot access file xyz" message is displayed before 
*        re-prompting.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The identifier of the group in which the NDF names are to be
*        stored. A new group is created if the supplied value is GRP__NOID.
*        It should be deleted when no longer needed using GRP_DELET.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The total number of NDF names in the returned group.
*     FLAG = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If the group expression was terminated by the GRP "flag
*        character", then FLAG is returned true. Otherwise it is
*        returned false. Returned .FALSE. if an error occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Any file names containing wildcards or "[..]" globbing patterns are 
*     expanded into a list of NDF names. The supplied strings are intepreted 
*     by a shell (/bin/tcsh if it exists, otherwise /bin/csh, otherwise 
*     /bin/sh), and so may contain shell meta-characters (eg twiddle, $HOME, 
*     even command substitution and pipes - but pipe characters "|" need to 
*     be escaped using a backslash "\" to avoid them being interpreted as GRP
*     editing characters).
*     -  Each supplied name may include an HDS path. For instance,
*     "/home/dsb/mydata.a.c(1).b" refers to an NDF stored in component
*     "a.c(1).b" in the HDS container file /home/dsb/mydata.sdf. Note,
*     wild cards are not allowed within HDS component paths (i.e. they
*     are only allowed within the specification of the container file).
*     -  If an HDS object is specified which is not an NDF, then the
*     object will be searched for NDF components. This search is
*     recursive, in that any components of the specified object are also
*     searched. The supplied name will be expanded into a group of names,
*     one for each NDF found within the specified HDS object. Note, NDFs 
*     are not themselves searched for other NDFs. That is, the expanded
*     group of names will not include any NDF which is contained within 
*     another NDF (i.e. NDFs which are stored as an extension item of
*     another NDF are not included in the group). For instance, if the 
*     string "fred" is given, the HDS file fred.sdf will be searched for
*     NDFs and the returned group will contain references for all NDFs
*     found within fred.sdf.
*     - If the environment variable NDF_FORMATS_IN is defined (see
*     SSN/20) then only the highest priority file with any give file name
*     is included in the returned group. The priority of a file is
*     determined by its file type. Native NDFs (.sdf) have highest
*     priority. After that, priority decreases along the list of file
*     types specified in NDF_FORMATS_OUT. If no file type is given by
*     the user, the highest priority available file type is used. If an
*     explicit file type is given, then that file type is used.
*     -  Care should be taken if a trailing string enclosed in square
*     brackets is appended to the end of the file name. These are
*     interpreted first as a globbing pattern. Thus "fred[12]" would
*     match files with base names "fred1" and "fred2". If the pattern
*     does not match any existing files, then the trailing "[..]" string
*     is next interpreted as a foreign extension specifier. Thus if fred.fit 
*     is a multi-extension FITS file, "fred[12]" would be interpreted as
*     the twelth image extension in fred.fit only if files cannot be found
*     with basenames "fred1" or "fred2".
*     -  NDFs contained within HDS files are opened in order to ensure
*     that they are valid NDFs. The user is notified if there are no 
*     valid NDFs matching a supplied name, and they are asked to supply 
*     a replacement parameter value. No check is made that any foreign
*     data files contain valid NDFs since this would involve a potentially
*     expensive data conversion. So, for instance, "*.fit" could pick up
*     FITS catalogues as well as FITS images. If a foreign data file does
*     not contain a valid NDF, an error will be reported when the NDF is
*     accessed using NDG_NDFAS.
*     -  Each element in the returned group contains a full specification 
*     for an NDF. Several other groups are created by this routine, and
*     are associated with the returned group by means of a GRP "owner-slave"
*     relationship. These supplemental groups are automatically deleted
*     when the returned group is deleted using GRP_DELET. The returned
*     group should not be altered using GRP directly because corresponding 
*     changes may need to be made to the supplemental groups. Routines
*     NDG_SETSZ, NDG_GTSUP and NDG_PTSUP are provided to manipulate the
*     entire chain of groups. The full chain (starting from the head) is 
*     as follows:
*
*        - NDF slice specifications
*        - HDS paths
*        - File types
*        - Base file names
*        - Directory paths
*        - Full NDF specification (this is the returned group IGRP)
*
*     -  If an error is reported the group is returned unaltered. If
*     no group is supplied, an empty group is returned.
*     -  A null value (!) can be given for the parameter to indicate
*     that no more NDFs are to be specified. The corresponding error 
*     is annulled before returning unless no NDFs have been added to
*     the group.
*     -  If the last character in the supplied group expression is 
*     a colon (:), a list of the NDFs represented by the group 
*     expression (minus the colon) is displayed, but none are
*     actually added to the group. The user is then re-prompted for 
*     a new group expression.
