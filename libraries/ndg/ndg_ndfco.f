      SUBROUTINE NDG_NDFCO( INDF1, IGRP, INDEX, INDF2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG_NDFCO

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain an NDF identifier for a new NDF created by copying
*     an existing NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG_NDFCO( INDF1, IGRP, INDEX, INDF2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine returns an NDF identifier for a new NDF created by
*     copying an existing NDF. The name of the new NDF is held
*     at a given index within a given group. It is equivalent to NDF_PROP.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier for an existing NDF (or NDF section) to act as a
*        template.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for a group holding the names of NDFs. This
*        will often be created using NDG_CREAT, but groups created "by
*        hand" using GRP directly can also be used.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the group at which the name of the NDF to be
*        accessed is stored.
*     INDF2 = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifier for the new NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If this routine is called with STATUS set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the INDF2 argument, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be
*     returned if the routine should fail for any reason. The NDF__NOID
*     constant is defined in the include file NDF_PAR.
