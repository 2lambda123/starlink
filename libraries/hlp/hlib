#  Translate one or more HELP libraries from source form to the
#  direct-access file used by the software.
#
#  Command:
#
#      hlib  helpfile1 helpfile2...
#
#  A HELP source file called "helpfile" is translated into
#  the file "helpfile.shl".
#
#  It is suggested that HELP source file names end with ".hlp".
#
#  Thus the command "hlib *.hlp" will translate all HELP libraries
#  in the current directory into the form required for use.
