**
**  Satisfy any pending switch to another HELP library.  If a switch is
**  made, return the context information for the first entry in the new
**  library and skip that entry.
**
**  Given (in global data):
**     *hlopen    char    name of open HELP library
**     *hlnext    char    name of next HELP library
**     *fphl      FILE    file pointer for HELP library file
**     nextx      long    index address for this sequential access
**     loffnu     int     logical level for the next HELP library
**
**  Given (arguments):
**     nametr     func     user-supplied name translation routine (note 1)
**     lstring    int      length of string (including '\0')
**
**  Returned (in global data):
**     nextx      long     index address for this sequential access
**     nextd      long     data address for next sequential access
**     levoff     int      logical level for the current HELP library
**
**  Returned (arguments)
**     *string    char     workspace to receive index entry
**     *fname     char     new HELP library name
**     *iadr      long     address for first index entry
**     *logl      int      logical level number for new library
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int      status:  0 = OK
**                      hlp_BAD_INDEX = illegal index record
**                               else = status from called routines
**
**  Defined in #include file:
**     LFNAME     int      maximum length of file names (including '\0')
**     Error codes
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1)  The user-supplied name translation function nametr has
**      arguments command, string1, lstring2, string2 and returns
**      a status:
**
**      * command (given) is an integer which the HELP system always
**        sets to zero;  the application may use other values of
**        command, for example to perform initializations or enquiries;
**
**      * string1 (given) is, for command=0, the HELP library name to
**        be translated;  this name can be is the value of the file
**        argument to the present routine (identifying the root library)
**        or the name following the '@' symbol in a HELP source file
**        (identifying another library grafted onto the current
**        library);
**
**      * lstring2 (given) is, for command=0, the length of string2
**        (defined next);
**
**      * string2 (returned) is, for command=0, the translation of
**        string2 into a filename for use in fopen calls;
**
**      * the nametr function return is a status, zero indicating
**        success.
**
**  2)  If no library switch occurs, string, fname, iadr and logl
**      are unchanged.
