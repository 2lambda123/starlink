Revision Date 13 June 1995

=================================
Starlink HLP system version 3.3-2
=================================

To import a new version from VAX to PC, copy all the files and execute
the command procedure PC.BAT.

To rebuild both the VAX and the Unix releases, execute the CREATE.COM
command procedure.  This ends with instructions on what to do from
the Unix end.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1

*  Logical name HELP_DIR changed to HELPDIR to avoid name clash with
   a JACH system.  (14 June 1991, requested by P N Daly)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2

*  Default file extension .HLB for Starlink HELP libraries changed
   to .SHL in order to avoid confusion with VMS Help library files.
   (25 June 1991, requested by D Mills)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3

*  Small modifications to the PC batch files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0

*  Portable to Sun SPARCstation and DECstation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.1

*  THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE HELP SYSTEM WHICH MAKE IT
   NECESSARY TO MODIFY APPLICATION CODE.

*  The principal interface to the help system is now called hlp_HELP.
   This new routine has the same call as the old hlp_OUTHLP but with
   one extra argument - the name translation routine to be used.

*  The hlp_OUTHLP routine has been retired.

*  A new version of the supplied implementation of the name translation
   routine, still called hlp_NAMETR, includes internal character strings
   which will be, respectively, prefixed and suffixed to the BEFORE
   string to produce the filename AFTER.  The prefix and suffix strings
   will initially be spaces and will cause hlp_NAMETR to continue handing
   back the given string unchanged as in previous releases.

*  The argument list for the name translation routine has been changed,
   and now contains an extra first argument, and integer command number.
   The HELP system only ever calls the routine with zero as the command
   number.  The supplied routine, hlp_NAMETR, accepts commands 0-4, which
   do the following things:

         CALL hlp_NAMETR (command,instring,outstring,status)

         command        action          instring     outstring

            0         translate name     before        after
            1         change prefix      prefix          -
            2         change suffix      suffix          -
            3         enquire prefix       -           prefix
            4         enquire suffix       -           suffix

   In each case, bad status means that a string suffered significant
   truncation.

   (The above changes were implemented in August 1992)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.2

*  There was a bug in the internal routine hlp_HLEAP affecting the
   case where library A points to library B and library B is missing.
   The error was being handled correctly but left the system in a
   state where further invocations of hlp_HELP did not work properly:
   whenever a topic was requested the previous error would get
   re-reported.  This has been fixed.  (25 August 1992, reported by
   A.J.Chipperfield)
   
*  There was a bug in the internal routine hlp_COMSTR which meant that
   under some circumstances an entered help topic could be interpreted
   as if it had been prefixed with a "match n" wildcard.  For example,
   an entered string "c*" might occasionally be matched to the help
   topic "abcdef".  This has been fixed.  (26 August 1992)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.1

*  Added the important missing feature that when a topic is specified
   exactly (no abbreviations or wildcards), the search stops at that
   point to give access to subtopics.

*  Added VMS shareable images and link options file.

*  Added hlp_link_adam for Unix.

*  Simplified makefile, combining build_demo with build etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.2

*  New mk script and makefile supplied.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.3

*  The behaviour in the no-interactive-prompting (JFLAGS=0) case has
   been changed.  Previously, if no topics were found for the given
   INLINE string, no output occurred.  Now, exactly the same output
   occurs as in the normal JFLAGS=1 case (i.e. the "Sorry..." message
   and the list of level-1 topics).

*  The name of the package was changed from HELP to HLP.  The VMS
   directory changed from HELPDIR to HLP_DIR.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.3-2

*  Imported into CVS and autoconfed.  Since autoconfing generally
   obviates the need for the platform-specific files, I took this
   opportunity to rationalise this.  In fact the `platform-specific'
   files `comic*', `crehlp.f*', `insub.f*' and `outsub.f*' were
   identical on all platforms (even to the extent of all saying they
   were the Sparc version!), and have been collapsed to a single file.
   Only the `fopr.f*' files were actually platform dependent, (as
   usual depending on the OPEN READONLY statement), and these have
   been turned into a single .fpp file.  There are no functionality
   changes in this version.
