/* Subroutine:  psx_asctime( tstrct, string, status )
*+
*  Name:
*     PSX_ASCTIME

*  Purpose:
*     Convert a time structure to a character string

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PSX_ASCTIME( TSTRCT, STRING, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Convert the information in the structure pointed to by TSTRCT to a
*     character string. TSRCT should have been set by a call to PSX_LOCALTIME
*     or PSX_GMTIME.

*  Arguments:
*     TSTRCT = POINTER (Given)
*        The pointer to the time structure.
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The character string representation of the time.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Examples:
*        CALL PSX_TIME( NTICKS, STATUS )
*        CALL PSX_LOCALTIME( NTICKS, SEC, MINS, HOUR, DAY, MONTH, YEAR,
*       :   WDAY, YDAY, ISDST, TSTRCT, STATUS )
*        CALL PSX_ASCTIME( TSTRCT, STRING, STATUS )
*        PRINT *,'The time is ',STRING
*
*        Prints the current local time as something like:
*        "Wed Apr 17 09:01:04 1991" (without the quotes).

*  Notes:
*     -  TSTRCT is declared to be of type POINTER. This is usually
*        represented in FORTRAN as an INTEGER, although any type that
*        uses the same amount of storage would be just as good.
*     -  The C string returned by the POSIX function localtime contains
*        a new line character. This is removed before being passed back
*        to the calling FORTRAN routine.
*     -  The actual argument corresponding to STRING should be at least
*        24 characters long.

*  External Routines Used:
*     cnf: cnfCptr, cnfExprt

*  History:
*     17-APR-1991 (PMA):
*        Original version.
*     27-JUN-1991 (PMA):
*        Changed IMPORT and EXPORT macros to GENPTR.
*     23-JUN-2000 (AJC):
*        Properly import TSTRCT
*        Tidy refs to CNF routines
*     08-JAN-2002 (AJC):
*        #include <string.h>
*     22-SEP-2004 (TIMJ):
*        Use asctime_r if present
*     09-MAR-2005 (PWD):
*        Include unistd.h to get POSIX environment.
*        Test for HAVE_ASCTIME_R_THREE_ARGS to work around Solaris asctime_r
*        having three arguments by default.
