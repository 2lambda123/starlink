/* Subroutine:  psx_srand( seed, status )
*+
*  Name:
*     PSX_SRAND

*  Purpose:
*     Set the seed for the random number generator

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PSX_SRAND( SEED, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The argument SEED is used to set a new seed for the sequence of
*     random numbers returned by the subroutine PSX_RAND. If PSX_SRAND
*     is called with the same value of SEED, then the values returned by
*     subsequent calls to PSX_RAND will be the same. If PSX_RAND is
*     called before calling PSX_SRAND, then the sequence of random
*     number returned by PSX_RAND will the the same as if PSX_SRAND had
*     been called with SEED set to one.

*  Arguments:
*     SEED = INTEGER (Given)
*        The seed for the random number generator.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The range of values allowed for SEED is not specified. It is
*        unlikely that values between 1 and the maximum integral value
*        that PSX_RAND can return will cause problems.
