/* Subroutine:  psx_malloc( size, pntr, status )
*+
*  Name:
*     PSX_MALLOC

*  Purpose:
*     Allocate virtual memory

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PSX_MALLOC( SIZE, PNTR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine allocates an amount of virtual memory specified by
*     SIZE. The memory returned is not initialized. The unit of SIZE is
*     the amount of storage required to store a single character. A
*     pointer to the allocated storage is returned in PNTR. This
*     pointer can be passed on to other subroutines using the %VAL
*     construct. If the storage cannot be allocated, then PNTR is set
*     to zero, STATUS is set to PSX__NOALL and an error is reported.

*  Arguments:
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The amount of virtual memory to be allocated.
*     PNTR = POINTER (Returned)
*        A pointer to the allocated storage.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Examples:
*        CALL PSX_MALLOC( 40, PNTR, STATUS )
*        CALL SUB1( %VAL(PNTR), 10, STATUS )
*           ...
*        SUBROUTINE SUB1( ARRAY, N, STATUS )
*        INTEGER N
*        INTEGER ARRAY( N )
*           ...
*
*        Allocates 40 bytes and uses this as a 10 element integer array.
*
*        The call to PSX_MALLOC allocates forty bytes of storage. The
*        pointer to this storage is then passed to subroutine SUB1,
*        where it is accessed as an array of integers.
*        We assume SUB1 returns without action if STATUS is bad.
*
*        Note that here the program needs to know that an INTEGER variable
*        is stored in four bytes. THIS IS NOT PORTABLE. In such a case
*        it is better to use PSX_CALLOC or to use the symbolic
*        constants NUM_NB<T> defined in the file PRM_PAR to determine
*        the number of bytes per unit of storage. (See SUN/39 for a
*        description of these constants).

*  Notes:
*     -  Storage allocated by PSX_MALLOC should be returned by a call to
*        PSX_FREE when it is no longer needed.
*     -  PNTR is declared to be of type POINTER. This is usually
*        represented in FORTRAN as an INTEGER, although any type that
*        uses the same amount of storage would be just as good.
*        The pointer will have been registered for C and FORTRAN use,
*        according to the scheme described in SUN/209, allowing its use
*        where pointers are longer than INTEGERs. For portability, the
*        construct %VAL(CNF_PVAL(PNTR)), rather than simply %VAL(PNTR),
*        should be used to pass the pointer to the subroutine. Function
*        CNF_PVAL is described in SUN/209 Section `Pointers'.
*     -  If several calls to PSX_MALLOC are made, the space returned by
*        each call is completely separate from that made by any other
*        call. In particular, the program should not assume that the
*        space returned by successive calls is contiguous.

*  External Routines Used:
*     cnf: cnfMalloc, cnfFptr
