/* Subroutine:  psx_realloc( size, pntr, status )
*+
*  Name:
*     PSX_REALLOC

*  Purpose:
*     Change the size of an allocated region of virtual memory

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PSX_REALLOC( SIZE, PNTR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine changes the size of the region of virtual memory
*     pointed to by PNTR. The new size may be larger or smaller than
*     the old size. The contents of the object pointed to by PNTR
*     shall be unchanged up to the lesser of the old and new sizes.

*  Arguments:
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The new amount of virtual memory required
*     PNTR = POINTER (Given and Returned)
*        A pointer to the allocated storage
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status

*  Examples:
*        CALL PSX_MALLOC( 20, PNTR, STATUS )
*           ...
*        CALL PSX_REALLOC( 40, PNTR, STATUS )
*        CALL SUB1( %VAL(PNTR), 10, STATUS )
*           ...
*        SUBROUTINE SUB1( ARRAY, N, STATUS )
*        INTEGER N
*        INTEGER ARRAY( N )
*          ...
*
*        Allocates 20 bytes of storage, then extends it to 40 bytes.
*
*        The call to PSX_MALLOC allocates twenty bytes of storage. The
*        subsequent call to PSX_REALLOC extends this area to forty
*        bytes.  The pointer to this storage is then passed to
*        subroutine SUB1, where it is accessed as an array of integers.
*        We assume SUB1 returns without action if STATUS is bad.
*
*        Note that in this case the program needs to know that an
*        INTEGER variable is stored in four bytes. THIS IS NOT
*        PORTABLE. In such a case it is better to use the symbolic
*        constants NUM_NB<T> defined in the file PRM_PAR to determine
*        the number of bytes per unit of storage. (See SUN/39 for a
*        description of these constants).

*  Notes:
*     -  Storage allocated by PSX_REALLOC should be returned by a call
*        to PSX_FREE when it is no longer needed.
*     -  PNTR is declared to be of type POINTER. This is usually
*        represented in FORTRAN as an INTEGER, although any type that
*        uses the same amount of storage would be just as good.
*        The pointer will have been registered for C and FORTRAN use,
*        according to the scheme described in SUN/209, allowing its use
*        where pointers are longer than INTEGERs. For portability, the
*        construct %VAL(CNF_PVAL(PNTR)), rather than simply %VAL(PNTR),
*        should be used to pass the pointer to the subroutine. Function
*        CNF_PVAL is described in SUN/209 Section `Pointers'.
*     -  If SIZE is zero, then the space pointed to by PNTR is freed.
*     -  If the space that PNTR pointed to has been deallocated by a
*        call to PSX_FREE (or to PSX_REALLOC with SIZE = 0), then it is
*        undefined whether the pointer can subsequently be used by
*        PSX_REALLOC.  Consequently this should not be attempted, even
*        though it will work on some machines.
*     -  The value of PNTR may be changed by this routine as it may be
*        necessary to allocate a new region of memory and copy the
*        contents of the old region into the new one.

*  External Routines Used:
