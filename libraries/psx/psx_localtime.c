*  Name:
*     PSX_LOCALTIME

*  Purpose:
*     Convert a value returned by PSX_TIME to individual local time values

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PSX_LOCALTIME( NTICKS, SECS, MINS, HOURS, DAY, MONTH, YEAR,
*    :   WDAY, YDAY, ISDST, TSTRCT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Convert a value returned by PSX_TIME into a set of usable numbers
*     expressed in local time, and a pointer to the corresponding C structure.

*  Arguments:
*     NTICKS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of ticks since the start of the calendar.
*     SECS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of seconds in the given time.
*     MINS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of minutes in the given time.
*     HOURS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of hours in the given time.
*     DAY = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the day of the month.
*     MONTH = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the month in the year (counting from zero).
*     YEAR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the year (last two digits).
*     WDAY = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the day in the week.
*     YDAY = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the day in the year (counting from zero).
*     ISDST = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Daylight savings time flag.
*     TSTRCT = POINTER (Returned)
*        A pointer to the C time structure.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The value of MONTH is 0 for January, 1 for February, etc. This
*        is to maintain compatibility with the C run time library.
*     -  The value of YDAY is 0 for the first of January, 1 for the
*        second of January, etc. This is to maintain compatibility with
*        the C run time library.
*     -  The value of WDAY is 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.
*     -  The value of ISDST is 1 when daylight saving time is in effect,
*        0 when it is not and -1 when the information is not available.
*     -  The pointer TSTRCT points to the C structure that contains the
*        information about the time. This pointer is needed as it may be
*        passed on to PSX_ASCTIME.
*        The structure will be overwritten by any future call to
*        PSX_LOCALTIME or PSX_GMTIME.
*     -  TSTRCT is declared to be of type POINTER. This is usually
*        represented in FORTRAN as an INTEGER, although any type that
*        uses the same amount of storage would be just as good.

*  External Routines Used:
*        cnf: cnFpptr, cnfMalloc

*  History:
*     16-APR-1991 (PMA):
*        Original version.
*     10-JUN-1991 (PMA):
*        Removed the addition of 1 to MONTH and YDAY.
*     27-JUN-1991 (PMA):
*        Changed IMPORT and EXPORT macros to GENPTR.
*     14-APR-1993 (PMA):
*        Cast the argument of localtime to the correct type.
*        Cast the temporary pointer to an F77 pointer.
*     21-JUN-2000 (AJC)::
*        Properly register and export TSTRCT (see CNF, SUN/209)
*     22-SEP-2004 (TIMJ):
*        Remove the cast from nticks to time_t and replace with an internal
*        variable since the cast
