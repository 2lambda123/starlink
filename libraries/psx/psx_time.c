/* Subroutine: psx_time( nticks, status )
*+
*  Name:
*     PSX_TIME

*  Purpose:
*     Get the current calendar time

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PSX_TIME( NTICKS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Determine the current calendar time. The encoding of the value is
*     unspecified, but is the number of ticks since some date in the
*     past. If it is not possible to get the value of NTICKS, STATUS is
*     set to PSX__NOTIM and an error is reported.

*  Arguments:
*     NTICKS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The current time.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine is not directly useful in itself, but the value
*        returned in NTICKS can be passed to other routines that process
*        it further.

*     22-SEP-2004 (TIMJ):
*        Add check for 32bit integer overflow in 2038
*     10-MAR-2005 (TIMJ):
*        Return immediately with nticks=-1 if status is bad on entry
