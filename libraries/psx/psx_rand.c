/* Subroutine:  psx_rand( inum, maxnum, fnum, status )
*+
*  Name:
*     PSX_RAND

*  Purpose:
*     Generate a random number

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PSX_RAND( INUM, MAXNUM, FNUM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Generate a random number. The number is generated as the integer
*     INUM. The maximum value that this may have is returned as MAXNUM.
*     Also the value of INUM/MAXNUM is returned as FNUM.

*  Arguments:
*     INUM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The random (integer) number.
*     MAXNUM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The maximum value that INUM may have.
*     FNUM = REAL (Returned)
*        The value INUM/MAXNUM.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A seed for the random number generator may be set with
*        PSX_SRAND.
*     -  The sequence of numbers generated by the operating system
*        service that is called by this routine is not always as random
*        as it should be. It is probably better to use a different
*        routine such as one of the NAG routines. This routine is
*        included here for completeness, though.
