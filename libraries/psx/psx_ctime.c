/* Subroutine:  psx_ctime( nticks, string, status )
*+
*  Name:
*     PSX_CTIME

*  Purpose:
*     Convert the calendar time to a character string

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PSX_CTIME( NTICKS, STRING, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Convert the number of ticks since the beginning of the calendar
*     (the value returned by PSX_TIME) to a character string.

*  Arguments:
*     NTICKS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of ticks since the start of the calendar.
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The character string representation of the time.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Examples:
*        CALL PSX_TIME( NTICKS, STATUS )
*        CALL PSX_CTIME( NTICKS, STRING, STATUS )
*        PRINT *,'The time is ',STRING
*
*        Prints the current time as something like:
*        "Wed Apr 17 09:01:04 1991" (without the quotes).

*  Notes:
*     -  The C string returned by the POSIX function ctime contains a
*        new line character. This is removed before being passed back
*        to the FORTRAN routine.
*     -  The actual argument corresponding to STRING should be at least
*        24 characters long.

*  External Routines Used:
*     cnf: cnfExprt

*  History:
*     17-APR-1991 (PMA):
*        Original version.
*     27-JUN-1991 (PMA):
*        Changed IMPORT and EXPORT macros to GENPTR.
*     23-JUN-2000 (AJC):
*        Tidy refs to CNF routines
*     22-SEP-2004 (TIMJ):
*        Use ctime_r if available.
*        Remove the cast from nticks to time_t and replace with an internal
*        variable since the cast does not work reliably if sizeof(Fortran int)
*        != sizeof(time_t).
*     09-MAR-2005 (PWD):
*        Include unistd.h to get POSIX environment.
*        Test for HAVE_CTIME_R_THREE_ARGS to work around Solaris ctime_r
*        having three arguments by default.
*     {enter_changes_here}
