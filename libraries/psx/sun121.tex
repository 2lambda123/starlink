\section{\xlabel{introduction}Introduction}

% \subsection{Warning}

% The current version of this software is a preliminary version. It is not yet
% complete and will continue to be developed in the near future. However, this
% first release has been made to provide much needed facilities as soon as
% possible and to whet the appetite of the programmer.

% Future modifications to this package should not change any existing routines,
% but will consist of the addition of many new routines.

\subsection{\xlabel{who_should_read_this_document}Who should read this document?}

It is frequently the case that a FORTRAN programmer will need to use
facilities that the operating system of the host computer provides and
which pure FORTRAN~77 does not.  This document is intended for
programmers who need to use such facilities, and to do so in a portable
way.

\subsection{\xlabel{overview}Overview}

When writing programs that interact with the real world, as opposed to
those that do some purely mathematical calculation, it is often
necessary to make use of features of the operating system. A simple
example of this is getting the current date and time. Most FORTRAN
systems provide subroutines to let the programmer get this information,
but the syntax of these routines differ from one computer to another,
making the resulting code non portable. What is required
is a portable operating system interface, and that is exactly what
POSIX is. It is a set of routines that let an application program
interact with the host operating system of the computer in a standard
manner.

POSIX will eventually define a whole set of standards, but the one of
interest here is that known as IEEE~1003.1-1988. This standard is
published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers
(IEEE) and is recognized by the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI). To quote from the standard \cite{psx:std}, `It defines a
standard operating system interface and environment to support
application portability at the source code level.' What this means is
that if you include a POSIX call in your program, then your program
will work on any system that is POSIX compliant. Since POSIX has its
origins in Unix, it is not surprising that several of the many
different Unix systems are already fully or nearly, POSIX compliant.
% Significantly, VMS is not yet POSIX compliant, but it will be `in a
% future major release of VMS', to use the DEC parlance.

On account of the Unix origin of POSIX, some of the terminology used in
describing the routines has a Unix accent. Any confusion caused by this
should be resolved by the notes for each routine.

\subsection{\xlabel{what_exactly_is_posix}What exactly \emph{is} POSIX?}

If you really mean that, you had better go and read the standard\cite{psx:std}.
However, to a reasonable approximation, POSIX (1003.1) is just the C run time
library and indeed the POSIX standard makes reference to the ANSI C standard
\cite{c:std}. Unfortunately, different computers have somewhat different C
run time libraries. The point of POSIX is to define a common run time library
that will be available on all computers.

\section{\xlabel{the_psx_library}The PSX library}

The 1003.1 standard actually defines a C interface to POSIX. This is
the obvious thing to do since POSIX is derived from the C run time
library. However, that is not much comfort if you actually want to call
the POSIX routines from FORTRAN. There is a draft standard (1003.9)
that defines how the routines should be called from FORTRAN (referred
to as the FORTRAN binding), but that is still a draft and commercial
products based on that standard are unlikely to be available for some
while. Furthermore, in order to cope with the C concepts that are
inherent in POSIX, the draft standard for the FORTRAN binding has
defined things in such a way that it makes using POSIX directly from
FORTRAN somewhat painful.

To make life easier for the FORTRAN programmer, a package of routines
called PSX has been written to which let FORTRAN programs make calls to
POSIX functions in a manner consistent with other Starlink subroutine
libraries. This means that FORTRAN programs that need to make use of
functions provided by the operating system can be written in a portable
manner. Another advantage of using the PSX routines instead of using
raw POSIX (even if we could) is that it allows us to use inherited
status that is a common feature of Starlink subroutine libraries. If a
PSX routine detects an error, it sets the STATUS argument of the
routine to one of the values given in appendix~\ref{include} and
reports an error via EMS (see \xref{SSN/4}{ssn4}{}).

Note that the names of the PSX routines are often longer than the
Starlink recommendation (\xref{SGP/16}{sgp16}{}) of the PSX\_ prefix
plus five more characters. This has been done so that the name of the
PSX routine corresponds directly with the name of the `real' POSIX
routine. This creates a potential problem with porting the routines to
other computers that might not accept names longer than six characters.
However, the draft standard for the FORTRAN binding to POSIX assumes
that compilers will accept names up to 31 characters (this is the
\emph{only}, extension to ANSI standard FORTRAN~77 that it assumes), so
this is no worse than basing routines directly on the specification of
the draft standard.

The PSX routines are just wrap around routines for POSIX routines. For further
details on these routines, you should consult the relevant standards documents
\cite{psx:std} and \cite{c:std}. If you do not have copies of these, the
documentation for the C run time library on your computer may be helpful.

\section{\xlabel{the_level_of_the_implementation}The Level of the Implementation}

So far, not all of the POSIX 1003.1 routines have been provided with a
PSX equivalent. Indeed this may never be achieved. The purpose of the
PSX routines is to enable the programmer to use functionality of POSIX,
so only those routines that are actually thought to be needed will be
provided. If you have a need for a routine that has not been provided,
please mail the author, who will do his best to provide the routine.
Each routine is fairly simple to write; it is only the sheer number of
routines that prevents a complete set being provided to date.

The POSIX 1003.1 standard refers to the ANSI~C standard for the
description of some of the routines. These are listed in the POSIX
standard under `language specific services for the C programming
language'. There are no corresponding routines in the draft FORTRAN
binding. Nevertheless, some of these routines are so useful that a PSX
implementation of them has been provided. Examples are allocating
virtual memory (using malloc) and getting the current date and time.

Descriptions of the routines that are currently available in the PSX
library are given in appendix~\ref{description}. Those routines that
have been considered for inclusion in the library and have been
rejected are listed in appendix~\ref{not-implelmented}.

\subsection{\xlabel{future_extensions}Future Extensions}

While the PSX routines are clearly very useful as they stand, they do
not always present the information in the manner that you may want. An
example of this is the subroutine PSX\_CTIME, which returns the data
and time in a particularly perverse format. The temptation to `improve'
some routines has been resisted to ensure that there is consistency
between the PSX routines and the corresponding true POSIX or C run-time
library routines. However, there is clearly a need for routines that
pull together some of the PSX routines in a more user friendly way and
to provide information in a different manner. These routines will be
provided in a separate package.

\section{\xlabel{xopen}X/OPEN}

Another attempt to achieve portable programs is that of the X/OPEN
group. The X/OPEN portability guide is a similar document to the POSIX
standard and is also based on the C run time library. The routines
defined in the X/OPEN portability guide tend to be of a higher level
than those in the POSIX standard and where appropriate, PSX equivalents
for X/OPEN routines will also be provided.

\section{\xlabel{compiling_and_linking}Compiling and Linking}

To use the PSX routines, you first need to `log on' for development by using
the \texttt{psx\_dev} command to create the necessary soft links in your
directory so that you can use the short form of the include file names.

\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
% psx_dev
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

If a FORTRAN program wishes to check for a particular error status returned by
a PSX routine, then it should contain the line

\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
INCLUDE 'PSX_ERR'
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

The use of upper-case in the file name is important. This will define the
symbolic constants listed in appendix~\ref{include}.

To compile and link a program that uses the PSX library, type

\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
% f77 program.f -L/star/lib `psx_link` -o program
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\section{\xlabel{examples}Examples}

So much for theory, here are some examples of the use of PSX routines. Each
POSIX routine tends to stand on its own, so the examples are fairly simple.

\subsection{\xlabel{create_a_file_with_name_that_is_specific_to_a_user}Create a file with name that is specific to a user}

The requirement is to create a file that will be used to hold the output of
several programs, but this file must be in a directory that is used by several
people. Clearly the file name must be related to the username. Also it is
necessary to take into account the difference in the syntax of directory names
on VMS and Unix systems.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
      PROGRAM NEWFIL

      IMPLICIT NONE
      INCLUDE 'SAE_PAR'
      INTEGER STATUS                   ! The global status value
      CHARACTER * ( 32 ) NAME          ! The name of the current user
      CHARACTER * ( 80 ) FILNAM        ! The name of the file to be created
      CHARACTER * ( 15 ) SYSNAME       ! The name of the operating system
      CHARACTER * ( 1 ) DUMMY1
      CHARACTER * ( 1 ) DUMMY2
      CHARACTER * ( 1 ) DUMMY3
      CHARACTER * ( 1 ) DUMMY4

* Set STATUS since this is is not an ADAM program.
      STATUS = SAI__OK

* Get the username.
      CALL PSX_GETENV( 'USER', NAME, STATUS )

* Get the system name.
      CALL PSX_UNAME( SYSNAME, DUMMY1, DUMMY2, DUMMY3, DUMMY4, STATUS )

* Create the file.
      IF( STATUS .EQ. SAI__OK ) THEN
         IF( SYSNAME .EQ. 'VMS' ) THEN
            FILNAM = 'COMMON_AREA:' // NAME // '.DAT'
         ELSE
            FILNAM = '/usr/common/' // NAME // '.DAT'
         END IF
         OPEN( UNIT=1, FILE=FILNAM, STATUS='NEW' )
         CLOSE( UNIT=1 )
      ELSE
         PRINT *,'Could not get username'
      END IF

      END
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

Although the PSX routines are designed to be used with other Starlink routines
in the ADAM environment and use the concept of inherited status, they can just
as easily be used in a stand alone program like the one above provided that the
status is set correctly before calling the first routine. This is important
since the PSX routine will exit immediately if STATUS is not set to the value
of the symbolic constant SAI\_\_OK.

\subsection{\xlabel{get_some_virtual_memory}Get some virtual memory}

One of the annoying features of FORTRAN~77 is that all storage space must be
allocated at compile time, \emph{i.e.} there are no dynamic arrays. Here is an
example of using PSX routines to dynamically allocate an array.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
      PROGRAM MAIN
      IMPLICIT NONE
      INCLUDE 'SAE_PAR'
      INTEGER STATUS

* Set the STATUS to OK.
      STATUS = SAI__OK

* Call the subroutine.
      CALL GETVM( STATUS )

      END


      SUBROUTINE GETVM( STATUS )
      IMPLICIT NONE
      INCLUDE 'SAE_PAR'
      INCLUDE 'CNF_PAR'
      INTEGER STATUS, PNTR

* Check global status.
      IF( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

* Create a ten element integer array and return a pointer to it.
      CALL PSX_CALLOC( 10, '_INTEGER', PNTR, STATUS )

* If all is well, operate on the array.
      IF (STATUS .EQ. SAI__OK) THEN
         CALL FILL( %VAL(PNTR), 10 )
         CALL PRNT( %VAL(PNTR), 10 )
         CALL PSX_FREE( PNTR, STATUS )
      END IF

      END


      SUBROUTINE FILL( ARRAY, N )
* Put some numbers in the array.
      INTEGER N, ARRAY( N )
      INTEGER I

      DO I = 1, N
         ARRAY( I ) = I
      END DO

      END


      SUBROUTINE PRNT( ARRAY, N )
* Print the elements of ARRAY.
      INTEGER N, ARRAY( N )
      INTEGER I

      DO I = 1, N
         PRINT *,ARRAY( I )
      END DO

      END
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

In this case the main program merely sets the value of STATUS and calls
the subroutine GETVM to do the work. Although this is more typing, it
does have the advantage that this could be made into an ADAM task
simply by deleting the main program. GETVM tests that the value of
STATUS returned from PSX\_CALLOC is OK, but does not print any error
message. This is not necessary, as the PSX routines all report their
own errors via the EMS routines. The reporting of error messages may be
deferred if required, as described in \xref{SUN/104}{sun104}{} and
\xref{SSN/4}{ssn4}{}.

If the code is required to work where pointers may be longer than INTEGERs,
The construct \texttt{\%VAL(CNF\_PVAL(PNTR))}, rather than simply
\texttt{\%VAL(PNTR)}, should be used in passing the pointer to FILL and PRNT.
Function CNF\_PVAL is defined in the CNF\_PAR include file and described in
\xref{SUN/209}{sun209}{accessing_dynamic_memory_from_c_and_fortran}\latex{
(section `Pointers')}.

\section{\xlabel{include_files}Include Files}
\label{include}

The symbolic constants that define the error codes returned by PSX
routines are defined in the file \texttt{/star/include/psx\_err}.  The
meaning of these constants is given below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
PSX\_\_INTYP & Invalid argument TYPE given in call to PSX\_CALLOC \\
PSX\_\_NOALL & Null pointer returned on memory allocation \\
PSX\_\_NOENV & No translation of an environment variable \\
PSX\_\_NOGMT & Could not get GMT with gmtime() \\
PSX\_\_NOTIM & Could not get current time with time() \\
PSX\_\_NOMEM & Could not get required memory \\
PSX\_\_ERRNO & System error during POSIX call
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

      NMEMB and TYPE. The number of bytes allocated is equal to the
      number of bytes required to store a single variable of type TYPE,
      multiplied by NMEMB. A pointer to the allocated storage is
      returned in PNTR. This pointer can be passed on to other
      subroutines using the \%VAL construct. If the storage cannot be
      allocated, then PNTR is set to zero, STATUS is set to PSX\_\_NOALL

            when it is no longer needed.

         \sstitem
         PNTR is declared to be of type POINTER. This is usually
            represented in FORTRAN as an INTEGER, although any type that
            uses the same amount of storage would be just as good.
            The pointer will have been registered for C and FORTRAN use
            according to the scheme described in
            \xref{SUN/209}{sun209}{pointers},
            allowing its use where pointers are longer than INTEGERs.
            For portability, the construct
            \%VAL(\xref{CNF\_PVAL}{sun209}
            {accessing_dynamic_memory_from_c_and_fortran}(PNTR)),
            rather than simply \%VAL(PNTR),
            should be used to pass the pointer to the subroutine.
            \latex{Function CNF\_PVAL is described in SUN/209 Section
            `Pointers'.}

         \sstitem
         If several calls to PSX\_CALLOC are made, the space returned by
            each call is completely separate from that made by any other
            call. In particular, the program should not assume that the
            space returned by successive calls is contiguous.

         \sstitem
         PSX\_CALLOC differs from the POSIX function calloc in that the
            size of each member to be allocated is specified by a character
            string (TYPE) rather than as a numerical value. This has been
            done to increase the portability of the routine.

         \sstitem
         The allowed values of TYPE are \_INTEGER, \_REAL, \_DOUBLE,
            \_LOGICAL, \_CHAR, \_BYTE, \_UBYTE, \_WORD and \_UWORD.
            The number of bytes allocated for each is as defined in the
            f77.h header file.

         \sstitem
         PNTR is declared to be of type POINTER. This is usually
            represented in FORTRAN as an INTEGER, although any type that
            uses the same amount of storage would be just as good.
            The pointer will have been registered for C and FORTRAN use
            according to the scheme described in
            \xref{SUN/209}{sun209}{pointers},
            allowing its use where pointers are longer than INTEGERs.
            For portability, the construct
            \%VAL(\xref{CNF\_PVAL}{sun209}
            {accessing_dynamic_memory_from_c_and_fortran}(PNTR)),
            rather than simply \%VAL(PNTR),
            should be used to pass the pointer to the subroutine.
            \latex{Function CNF\_PVAL is described in SUN/209 Section
            `Pointers'.}

         \sstitem
         If SIZE is zero, then the space pointed to by PNTR is freed.

         \sstitem
         If the space that PNTR pointed to has been deallocated by a
            call to PSX\_FREE (or to PSX\_REALLOC with SIZE = 0), then it is
            undefined whether the pointer can subsequently be used by
            PSX\_REALLOC.  Consequently this should not be attempted, even
            though it will work on some machines.

This is an alphabetical list of POSIX routines that have been considered for
implementation as PSX routines and have been rejected as unnecessary. Any
routine that has not been implemented, yet is not in the following list has
simply not yet been looked at and may well be done in the future.

If you have a need for any routine that has not been implemented, for whatever
the reason, then please contact the author of this document, who will endeavour

\end{description}

\section{\xlabel{notes_for_system_programmers}Notes for System Programmers}

Although the PSX routines appear to the user as FORTRAN subroutines,
they are actually written in C. The FORTRAN~--~C interface is handled
by the macros and functions of Starlink's
\xref{CNF}{sun209}{abstract}
package\latex{ (see SUN/209)}.
The use of these macros makes the source code sufficiently portable that it
runs on all Starlink supported hardware platforms.

Despite the fact that the routines are written in C, all character strings are
returned as normal FORTRAN strings with trailing blanks.

The PSX routines call the C run time library.

The PSX routines report errors via
\xref{EMS}{ssn4}{abstract}\latex{ (see SSN/4)}.
While this is a standard
feature of Starlink subroutine libraries, occasionally it will be
necessary \emph{not} to report errors via EMS. For example, if a PSX routine
is used within EMS, and that PSX routine were to report an error then
there is the potential for recursive error reports being generated.
Also, if the PSX routines were needed on a non-Starlink system, then
EMS would not necessarily be present. To try to take account of these
situations, the PSX routines actually call the internal routine
\texttt{psx1\_rep\_c} to report an error. This normally calls
\texttt{emsRep} (the C interface to
\xref{\texttt{EMS\_REP}}{ssn4}{EMS_REP}),
but could be re-coded where required.
