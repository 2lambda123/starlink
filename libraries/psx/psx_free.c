/* Subroutine:  psx_free( pntr, status )
*+
*  Name:
*     PSX_FREE

*  Purpose:
*     Free virtual memory

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PSX_FREE( PNTR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine frees the virtual memory pointed to by PNTR that was
*     previously allocated by a call to PSX_CALLOC or PSX_MALLOC.
*     It will try to free the memory regardless of the given value of
*     STATUS.

*  Arguments:
*     PNTR = POINTER (Given and Returned)
*        A pointer to the allocated storage.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  PNTR is declared to be of type POINTER. This is usually
*        represented in FORTRAN as an integer, although any type that
*        uses the same amount of storage would be just as good.

*  External Routines Used:
*     cnf: cnfCptr, cnfFree

*  History:
*     11-APR-1991 (PMA):
*        Original version.
*     27-JUN-1991 (PMA):
*        Changed IMPORT and EXPORT macros to GENPTR.
*     30-JAN-1992 (PMA):
*        Fixed bug - free(pntr) should have been free(*pntr).
*     14-APR-199 (RFWS):
*        Use CNF for memory de-allocation. Execute even if STATUS is set.
*     23-JUN-2000 (AJC):
*        Tidy refs to CNF routines
