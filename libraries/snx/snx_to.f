      SUBROUTINE snx_TO (SORN)
*+
*  Name:
*     TO

*  Purpose:
*     Switch from NCAR plotting to SGS or vice versa

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Arguments:
*     SORN = CHAR (Given)
*         New plotting interface

*  Notes:
*     The first character of SORN specifies which form of plotting
*     is about to start:
*
*       SORN(1:1) = 'S' or 's' means we have been plotting with
*                              NCAR and wish now to use SGS
*
*       SORN(1:1) = 'N' or 'n' means we have been using SGS and
*                              wish now to revert to NCAR
*
*     At the time this routine is first called, SGS must have been
*     opened and NCAR plotting must have occurred, so that the call
*     is to switch to SGS.  Subsequent calls must alternate
*     strictly between NCAR and SGS.  If this sequence is violated,
*     a message is output to the NCAR error reporting I/O unit.
*
*     An illegal SORN value is reported via a message to the
*     NCAR error reporting I/O unit.
