      IMPLICIT NONE

      INTEGER I1MACH,LUIN,LUOUT,J,IZONID
      CHARACTER WKSTN*20

*  Get standard I/O units
      LUIN=I1MACH(1)
      LUOUT=I1MACH(2)

*  Ask for SGS workstation name
 100  CONTINUE
      WRITE (LUOUT,'(1X,''Workstation?'')')
      READ (LUIN,'(A)') WKSTN

*  Display list if so requested
      IF (WKSTN(:1).EQ.' '.OR.
     :    WKSTN(:1).EQ.'?') GO TO 200

*  Attempt to open SGS and GKS
      CALL sgs_OPEN(WKSTN,IZONID,J)

*  Skip if OK
      IF (J.EQ.0) GO TO 300

*  Display list of workstation names and try again
 200  CONTINUE
      CALL sgs_WLIST(LUOUT)
      GO TO 100

*  Match the AUTOGRAPH coordinate system to the current zone
 300  CONTINUE
      CALL snx_AGWV

*  Make null calls to AGPWRT and AGCNHL to force linking with
*  SNX library versions.
