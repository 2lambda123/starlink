      SUBROUTINE snx_CURS (X,Y,N)

*+
*  Name:
*     CURS

*  Purpose:
*     Read a cursor position

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     This routine may only be called after NCAR AUTOGRAPH has been
*     used to plot a graph, thus having specified the mapping between
*     the coordinate systems involved.
*
*     Variations of choice device, cursor visibility, echo type, etc
*     may be made by direct SGS/GKS calls prior to calling this
*     routine.

*  Arguments:
*     X,Y = REAL (Given & Returned)
*         Where cursor is to be preset to if possible
*         and where cursor was when choice was made
*         X,Y are USER coordinates (i.e. data coordinates)
*     N = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Choice selected
