*  Name:
*     star_strlcat

*  Purpose:
*     Simple wrapper around the BSD strlcat function.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Description:
*     The strlcat function is similar to the strncat function except
*     that it guarantees to nul terminate the destination string
*     and returns the number of characters that will have been copied.

*  Invocation:
*     len = star_strlcat( char * dest, const char * src, size_t sizedest );


*  Arguments:
*     dest = char * (Returned)
*        Destination buffer for "src". Must be nul-terminated.
*        If status is bad on entry, "dest" will not be touched.
*     src = const char * (Given)
*        String to be appended onto "dest".
*     sizedest = size_t (Given)
*        The actual buffer size of "dest" including space for a nul.

*  Returned Value:
*     size_t retval
*        Length of the string that was created or the length of the
*        string that would have been created if sizedest was large enough.

*  History:
*     2008-07-11 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version.

*  Notes:
*     - This is for use from C only. 
*     - If available the system strlcat routine will be used. The entire
*       purpose of this routine is to provide a version of strlcat if
*       the operating system does not provide one (e.g. on Linux)
*     - The ONE implementation should always be used if
*       Starlink error handling is available.
