      SUBROUTINE GRP1_MODIF( BSIZE, SLOT1, SLOT2, INDEX, EDEP, EIFILE, 
     :                       NADDED, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_MODIF

*  Purpose:
*     Copy a basis group to another group

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_MODIF( BSIZE, SLOT1, SLOT2, INDEX, EDEP, EIFILE, NADDED,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The contents of the supplied basis group (SLOT1) are inserted
*     into another group (SLOT2) starting at the index specified by
*     INDEX. The supplemental information stored with the names is
*     modified to describe the new names. The supplied depth of
*     indirection (EDEP), and indirection file index (EIFILE) are
*     stored as the DEPTH and FILE attributes for the new names. The
*     GRP identified issued for the basis group is stored as the MODGRP
*     attribute for all the new names, and the index within SLOT1 from
*     which each name was copied is stored as the MODIN attribute of
*     each name.

*  Arguments:
*     BSIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements from the basis group which are to be 
*        copied. Elements with indices higher than BSIZE are not copied.
*     SLOT1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number for the basis group.
*     SLOT2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number for the group into which the names are to be
*        inserted.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within group SLOT2 at which the first name is to be
*        stored.
*     EDEP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The DEPTH attribute to be stored with each new name in group
*        SLOT2.
*     EIFILE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the FILES array (see routine GRP1_PTIND) at
*        which the the indirection file name is stored. This file name
*        will be returned as the FILE attribute for the new names.
*     NADDED = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of names addded to the group SLOT2. This will equal
*        the size of group SLOT1.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
