A new release (V3.0-2) of the GRP library is now available. It includes
fixes for the following bugs

 - GRP_FIND sometimes indicated that a matching string has been found 
 beyond the end of the group.

 - The last line of an indirection file was sometimes not read correctly 
 if the line was terminated by an end-of-file rather than a newline.
