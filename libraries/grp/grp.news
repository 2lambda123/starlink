A new release (V3.7) of the GRP library is now available. It includes
the following changes:

- A new routine GRP_SAME determines if two identifiers refer to the same
   group.
- A new routine GRP_SHOW to list the contents of a group to the screen.
- The GRP_OWN routine returns GRP__NOID without error if the supplied
  group identifier is GRP__NOID.
