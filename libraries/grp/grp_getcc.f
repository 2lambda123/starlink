      SUBROUTINE GRP_GETCC( IGRP, CCLIST, CC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_GETCC

*  Purpose:
*     Returns requested control characters for the specified group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_GETCC( IGRP, CCLIST, CC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Each group has associated with it several "control characters"
*     which are the characters used to indicate various items of syntax
*     within a group expression. These control characters can be
*     changed at any time by calling GRP_SETCC. This routine returns
*     the current values of a list of these control character.  The
*     individual characters are described in GRP__SETCC.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the group for which the control characters
*        are required.
*     CCLIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A comma separated list of control character names to be
*        returned. See routine GRP_SETCC for a description of these
*        names.
*     CC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        A character variable to receive the requested list of control
*        characters. The control characters are stored at adjacent
*        indices within this character variable, starting at index 1.
*        The characters are stored in the same order that they are
*        specified in CCLIST. An error is reported if the character
*        variable is not long enough to receive all the requested
*        control characters.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
