      SUBROUTINE GRP_PUT( IGRP, SIZE, NAMES, INDEX, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_PUT

*  Purpose:
*     Put a given set of literal names into a group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_PUT( IGRP, SIZE, NAMES, INDEX, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The given names are stored in the group in the form in which they
*     are supplied (including any control characters). They overwrite
*     any previous names stored at the specified indices. The group is
*     extended if the range of indices extends beyond the current size
*     of the group. The names can be appended to the end of the group
*     by giving INDEX a value of zero or one greater than the current
*     size of the group. An error is reported if the names are added
*     beyond the end of the group (i.e.  if adding the names would
*     result in a gap within the group for which no names would be
*     defined).

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the group.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the NAMES array.
*     NAMES( SIZE ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The names to be stored in the group. The first name is stored
*        at the index given by INDEX, the last is stored at index
*        INDEX+SIZE-1.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index at which to store the first name. A value of zero
*        causes the names to be appended to the end of the group.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
