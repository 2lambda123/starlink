*  Name:
*     GRP1_GSUPP

*  Purpose:
*     Retrieve group supplementary information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_GSUPP( INDEX, SIZE, LEVELS, IFILES, MODGPS, MODINS,
*                      LEVEL, IFILE, MODGP, MODIN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine retrieves the supplementary information relating to
*     a member of a group, from the corresponding GROUP arrays.

*  Arguments:
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the group from which the information is to be
*        retrieved.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the GROUP arrays.
*     LEVELS(SIZE) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The LEVEL array.
*     IFILES(SIZE) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FILE_INDEX array.
*     MODGPS(SIZE) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The MOD_GROUP  array.
*     MODINS(SIZE) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The MOD_INDEX  array.
*     LEVEL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The indirection depth at which the name was specified. Zero
*        is returned if the name was given directly, instead of by
*        an indirection element.
*     IFILE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index within the FILES array (see routine GRP1_PTIND) at
*        which the name of the indirection file in which the name was
*        specified is stored. A value fo zero is returned if the name
*        was given directly, instead of by an indirection element.
*     MODGP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The GRP slot number of the group used as a basis for the name
*        if it was created as a result of a modification element. A
*        value of zero is returned if the name was not created as a
*        result of a modification element.
*     MODIN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index within the group specified by MODGP, of the name
*        used as a basis for the name returned by argument NAME.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
