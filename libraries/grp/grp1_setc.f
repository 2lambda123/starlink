      SUBROUTINE GRP1_SETC( FIRST, LAST, SIZE, ARRAY, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_SETC

*  Purpose:
*     Set part of a character array to a constant value.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_SETC( FIRST, LAST, SIZE, ARRAY, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The given value is written into the given part of the array.

*  Arguments:
*     FIRST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first array element to be written to.
*     LAST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The last array element to be written to.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The total size of the array.
*     ARRAY( SIZE ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The array.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The value to write to the array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
