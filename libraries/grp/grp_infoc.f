      SUBROUTINE GRP_INFOC( IGRP, INDEX, ITEM, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_INFOC

*  Purpose:
*     Retrieve an item of character information about a name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_INFOC( IGRP, INDEX, ITEM, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns an item of character information about a
*     single name from a group. The item can be any one of those
*     described under argument ITEM.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP group identifier.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        An index within the group specified by IGRP.  If the supplied
*        value is outside the bounds of the group, then a blank value
*        is returned for VALUE, and an error is reported.
*     ITEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of an item of information. This can be any of the
*        following (abbreviations are not allowed):
*
*        NAME  -  The name itself. If the group is case insensitive
*        (as established by a call to routine GRP_SETCS) then the name
*        is returned in upper case.
*
*        FILE  -  The text file within which the name was explicitly
*        given. If the name was not specified within a file then FILE
*        is returned blank.
*
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The requested item of information. If the supplied character
*        variable is too short, the string is truncated. If an error
*        occurs a blank value is returned.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
