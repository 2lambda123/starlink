      SUBROUTINE GRP1_CPOIN( POINT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_CPOIN

*  Purpose:
*     Convert a pointer to a UNIX character array descriptor into a
*     pointer to the area of mapped memory which holds the characters.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_CPOIN( POINT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     UNIX does not use descriptors for character arrays, so just
*     return the supplied pointer unchanged.

*  Arguments:
*     POINT = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        On input, this is a pointer to a VMS character array
*        descriptor obtained using GRP1_CDESC. On exit, it is unchanged.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
