      INTEGER FUNCTION GRP1_SIMIN( A, B, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_SIMIN

*  Purpose:
*     Find the index of a given string within another string ignoring
*     the case of both strings.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = GRP1_SIMIN( A, B, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This function performs the same function as the Fortran intrinsic
*     function INDEX, except that the match between the two strings is
*     case insensitive.

*  Arguments:
*     A = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The string in which to search for the substring.
*     B = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The substring to search for.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     GRP1_SIMIN = INTEGER
*        The offset of the start of the first occurence of substring B
*        within string A (ignoring differences in case). If no match is
*        found a value of zero is returned.
