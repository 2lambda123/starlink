      SUBROUTINE GRP_LIST( PARAM, INDXLO, INDXHI, COMNT, IGRP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_LIST

*  Purpose:
*     Write names to a text file specified by the environment.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_LIST( PARAM, INDXLO, INDXHI, COMNT, IGRP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A text file is created with a name obtained from the environment
*     using the supplied parameter. The supplied comment is written to
*     the file as the first record (so long as it is not blank), using
*     the groups current comment character (see routine GRP_SETCC) .
*     All the names stored within the specified group section are then
*     written to the file, one name per record. If the group is case
*     insensitive (as set up by a call to routine GRP_SETCS) then the
*     names are written out in upper case, otherwise they are written
*     out as supplied.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter to be used to get the name of the text file to
*        be created.
*     INDXLO = INTEGER (Given)
*        The low index limit of the group section. If both INDXLO and
*        INDXHI are zero, then the entire group is used.
*     INDXHI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The high index limit of the group section.
*     COMNT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A comment line to form the first record in the file. The text
*        is prefixed with the group's current comment character before
*        being written to the file.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identifier for the group to be listed.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
