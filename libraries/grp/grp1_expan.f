*  Name:
*     GRP1_EXPAN

*  Purpose:
*     Expands indirection and modification elements, and lists.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_EXPAN( GRPEXP, START, END, BSIZE, SLOT1, SLOT2, GINDEX,
*                      EDEP, EIFILE, EMODGP, EMODIN, NADDED, NAME, FLAG,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The specified section of the supplied group expression is split
*     up into delimited elements. If more than one element is found,
*     each element is stored in the supplied group starting at the
*     supplied index. If only one element is found, the element is
*     checked to see if it is an indirection element. If it is, the
*     named file is read and each record from the file (excluding
*     comments) is stored in the supplied group, starting at the
*     supplied index. If the element is not an indirection element, it
*     is checked to see if it is a modification element. If it is, and
*     if a basis group has been supplied, the names contained in the
*     basis group are modified by the addition of the specified prefix
*     and suffix, and stored in the supplied group starting at the
*     supplied index. If the element is not a modification element, or
*     if it is but no basis group has been supplied, then the element is
*     stored in the supplied group at the supplied index without
*     modification, and NAME is returned .TRUE. (NAME is returned
*     .FALSE. otherwise). NAME is a flag used to indicate if the element
*     was a simple literal name. The supplied supplemental information
*     is stored with each new name added to the group.

*  Arguments:
*     GRPEXP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The group expression.
*     START = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the first character to be considered from the
*        group expression.
*     END = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the last character to be considered from the
*        group expression.
*     BSIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements from the basis group which are to be
*        used. Basis group elements with index larger than BSIZE are
*        ignored.
*     SLOT1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number for an existing group to be used as the basis
*        for an output group. If zero is given for SLOT1 then no check
*        is made for modification elements.  If any are given, they
*        will be treated as a single literal name.
*     SLOT2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number for the group in which to store the expanded
*        elements.
*     GINDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the group given by SLOT2 at which the first
*        new element is to be stored.
*     EDEP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The indirection depth at which the name was specified. Zero
*        should be given if the name was given directly, instead of by
*        an indirection element.
*     EIFILE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the FILES array (see routine GRP1_PTIND) at
*        which the the name of the indirection file in which the name
*        was specified is given. A value of zero should be given if the
*        name was given directly, instead of by an indirection element.
*     EMODGP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identifier for the group used as a basis for the name
*        if it was created as a result of a modification element. A
*        value of GRP__NOID should be given if the name was not created
*        as a result of a modification element.
*     EMODIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the group specified by MODGP, of the name
*        used as a basis for the name given by argument NAME.  If MODGP
*        is given as GRP__NOID, then MODIN is ignored.
*     NADDED = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of elements added to the group given by SLOT2.
*     NAME = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Returned true if the given section of the group expression
*        contained a single literal name.
*     FLAG = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Returned true if the last element read from an indirection
*        file is flagged.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
