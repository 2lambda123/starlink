      SUBROUTINE GRP1_IHEAD( ISLOT, IGRP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_IHEAD

*  Purpose:
*     Find the group at the head of a master-slave chain.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_IHEAD( ISLOT, IGRP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The identifier for the group at the head of the master-slave chain
*     containing the group with the supplied slot number is returned.
*     If the group is not part of a chain, then the identifier for the
*     supplied group is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     ISLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        A slot number.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP identifier for the group at the head of the chain.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Find the identifier issued for the group with slot number ISLTOW.
