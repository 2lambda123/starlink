      SUBROUTINE GRP_OWN( IGRP1, IGRP2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_OWN

*  Purpose:
*     Returns the identifier of the group which owns the specified
*     group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_OWN( IGRP1, IGRP2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     If the group identified by IGRP1 has had an "owner" group
*     established for it by a call to GRP_SOWN, then the identifier of
*     the owner group is returned in IGRP2. Otherwise, the value
*     GRP__NOID is returned (but no error is reported).

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the slave group whose owner is to be
*        returned.
*     IGRP2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the group which owns the group identified by
*        IGRP1. Returned equal to GRP__NOID if an error occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
