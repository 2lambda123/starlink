      SUBROUTINE GRP_DELET( IGRP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_DELET

*  Purpose:
*     Delete a group from the GRP system.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_DELET( IGRP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine releases the identifier and internal resources used
*     by the specified group so that they can be used for another
*     group.  There is a limited number of groups available for use
*     within an application, so each group should be deleted when it is
*     no longer needed to avoid the possibility of reaching the limit.
*
*     Note, any parameter association used to establish the group is NOT
*     cancelled.
*
*     This routine also deletes any groups which are related to the
*     supplied group by means of "owner-slave" relationships
*     established by calls to GRP_SOWN. All groups in the same
*     "owner-slave" chain are deleted whether higher up or lower down
*     than the supplied group.
*
*     This routine attempts to execute even if STATUS is bad on entry,
*     although no further error report will be made if it subsequently
*     fails under these circumstances.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        A GRP identifier for the group. Returned equal to GRP__NOID.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
