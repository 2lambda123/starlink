      SUBROUTINE GRP1_MODNM( SLOT2, ELEM, DEPTH, IFILE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_MODNM

*  Purpose:
*     Perform specified editing on a single specified name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_MODNM( SLOT2, ELEM, DEPTH, IFILE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Modification elements may contain a literal string instead of
*     a NAME_TOKEN character. In this case the editing specified by
*     the strings between the SEPARATOR characters is applied to the
*     literal string preceeding the first separator (i.e. all
*     occurrences of the string between the first pair of separators is
*     replaced by the string between the second pair of separators),
*     and the resulting single name is added to the end of the group.
*     See routine GRP1_MODIF for more information about modification
*     elements. This routine assumes that there is at least one
*     separator character in the supplied element, and that the
*     SEPARATOR control character is not currently set to the NULL
*     character.
*
*  Arguments:
*     SLOT2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP slot number for the output group. The control characters
*        associated with this group are used to define the syntax of the
*        modification element.
*     ELEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The text of the modification element.
*     DEPTH = INTEGER (Given)
*        The indirection depth at which the modification element was
*        given.
*     IFILE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the FILES array (see routine GRP1_PTIND) at
*        which the indirection file in which the modification element
*        was given is stored.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
