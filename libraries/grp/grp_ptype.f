      SUBROUTINE GRP_PTYPE( IGRP, TYPE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_PTYPE

*  Purpose:
*     Associate a new type string with a group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_PTYPE( IGRP, TYPE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The given type string is stored with the group, replacing the
*     previous value.  The maximum length of the type string is given
*     by symbolic constant GRP__SZTYP. If the supplied type string is
*     longer than this, the title is truncated.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the group.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The group type.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
