      SUBROUTINE GRP1_PTELM( SLOT, INDEX, NAME, LEVEL, IFILE, MODGP,
     :                       MODIN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_PTELM

*  Purpose:
*     Put an element into a group, including supplementary information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_PTELM( SLOT, INDEX, NAME, LEVEL, IFILE, MODGP, MODIN,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine stores the given text string in an element of the
*     NAMES array associated with the group identified by SLOT. The
*     supplementary information is stored in the corresponding elements
*     of the LEVEL, FILE_INDEX, MOD_GROUP and MOD_INDEX arrays (see
*     routine GRP1_GTSLT). The calling routine can specify an explicit
*     index at which the element is to be stored in the group, or
*     alternatively, if INDEX is negative or zero (or greater than the
*     current group size), the element is appended to the end of the
*     group.  If the index is greater than the size of the group
*     arrays, the arrays are extended to accommodate it.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP slot number for the group to which the new name is to
*        be added.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the group at which the element is to be
*        stored. If this is negative or zero, the element is appended
*        to the end of the group. If INDEX is is bigger than the size
*        of the group, then the group is extended to include the given
*        index. This may introduce blank elements.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The text to be stored in the NAMES array.
*     LEVEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The indirection depth at which the name was specified. Zero
*        should be given if the name was given directly, instead of by
*        an indirection element.
*     IFILE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the FILES array (see routine GRP1_PTIND) at
*        which the the name of the indirection file in which the name
*        was specified is given. A value of zero should be given if the
*        name was given directly, instead of by an indirection element.
*     MODGP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identifier for the group used as a basis for the name
*        if it was created as a result of a modification element. A
*        value of GRP__NOID should be given if the name was not created
*        as a result of a modification element.
*     MODIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the group specified by MODGP, of the name
*        used as a basis for the name given by argument NAME.  If MODGP
*        is given as GRP__NOID, then MODIN is ignored.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
