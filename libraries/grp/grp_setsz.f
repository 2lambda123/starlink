      SUBROUTINE GRP_SETSZ( IGRP, SIZE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_SETSZ

*  Purpose:
*     Reduce the size of a group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_SETSZ( IGRP, SIZE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine sets the size of the given group to the specified
*     value. The new size must be less than or equal to the old size.
*     The names with indices greater than the new size are lost. Other
*     names remain unaltered.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the group.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The new group size. If a negative value is given, then zero
*        is used.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
