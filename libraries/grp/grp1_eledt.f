      SUBROUTINE GRP1_ELEDT( SLOT, IN, OUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_ELEDT

*  Purpose:
*     Apply editing to a literal name

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_ELEDT( SLOT, IN, OUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine is supplied with an element expression containg a
*     single literal name, optionally contained within several levels
*     of nested OPEN_KERNEL and CLOSE_KERNEL characters. The kernel at
*     each level of nesting may have prefix, suffix and/or substitution
*     strings associated with it. The literal name contained within the
*     inner-most kernel is found, and any associated editing is
*     applied.  This is done by first doing any substitution specified
*     by a substitution string associated with the inner-most kernel.
*     Any prefix and suffix surrounding the inner most kernel are then
*     added to the name. Once the editing associated with the
*     inner-most kernel has been applied, the editing associated with
*     the next level of kernel nesting is applied, and so on until all
*     levels of kernel nesting have been processed. The resulting
*     literal name is returned in OUT.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number for the group whose control characters are to
*        be used to define the syntax of the element expression.
*     IN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The element expression.
*     OUT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The literal name corresponding to the element expression given
*        by IN.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
