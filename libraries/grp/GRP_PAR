*  Name:
*     GRP_PAR

*  Purpose:
*     Define public global constants for the GRP_ system.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global constants include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of global constants which are used
*     by the GRP_ system and which may also be needed by software which
*     calls routines from this system.

*  Global Constants:



*  General
*  =======

*  An illegal GRP_ identifier value. This value can sometimes be
*  specified by an application in place of a GRP_ identifier in order
*  to supress some operation.
      INTEGER GRP__NOID
      PARAMETER ( GRP__NOID = 0 )

*  String lengths.
*  ==============

*  Maximum length of a group expression.
      INTEGER GRP__SZGEX
      PARAMETER ( GRP__SZGEX = 2047 )

*  Length of a name within a group.
      INTEGER GRP__SZNAM
      PARAMETER ( GRP__SZNAM = 255 )

*  Max. length of a group type
      INTEGER GRP__SZTYP
      PARAMETER ( GRP__SZTYP = 80 )

*  Max. length of a file name.
      INTEGER GRP__SZFNM
      PARAMETER ( GRP__SZFNM = 256 )

*  Private status values returned by GRP1_WILD.
      INTEGER GRP__OK           ! GRP1_WILD success
      INTEGER GRP__WNMF         ! GRP1_WILD no more files
      INTEGER GRP__WPER         ! GRP1_WILD pipe error
      INTEGER GRP__WLER         ! GRP1_WILD length error
      INTEGER GRP__WMER         ! GRP1_WILD malloc error

      PARAMETER (
