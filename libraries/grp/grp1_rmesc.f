      SUBROUTINE GRP1_RMESC( SLOT, FIRST, LAST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_RMESC

*  Purpose:
*     Remove escape characters from a set of names.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_RMESC( SLOT, FIRST, LAST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine removes escape characters from the specified range
*     of names in the supplied group. Escape characters are only
*     removed if they preceed an active control character.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot index for the group.
*     FIRST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the first name to be checked.
*     LAST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the last name to be checked.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
