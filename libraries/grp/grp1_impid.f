      SUBROUTINE GRP1_IMPID( IGRP, SLOT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_IMPID

*  Purpose:
*     Import an identifier.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_IMPID( IGRP, SLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine converts a GRP identifier, previously issued by
*     GRP1_EXPID, into an index to the appropriate entry in the common
*     arrays.  The identifier value is fully checked and an error is
*     reported if it is not valid.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        GRP identifier.
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Index to an entry in the common arrays.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*      -  Set an initial value for the SLOT argument before checking
*      the inherited status.
*     -  Decode the IGRP value into an index for the common arrays.
*     -  If a valid index was not obtained, then report an error.
