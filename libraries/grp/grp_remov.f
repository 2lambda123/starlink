      SUBROUTINE GRP_REMOV( IGRP1, NAME, IGRP2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_REMOV

*  Purpose:
*     Remove all occurrences of a given name from a group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_REMOV( IGRP1, NAME, IGRP2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A new group is created by copying the contents of an existing
*     group, excluding any occurrences of a specified name. Note, a name
*     with a given index in the input group will in general have a
*     different index in the output group. The new group inherits the
*     type, control characters and case sensitivity flag of the old
*     group, but does not inherit any owner/slave relationships (see
*     routine GRP_SOWN). If the input group is no longer required, it
*     should be deleted using GRP_DELET.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the input group.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * )(Given)
*        The name to be removed. Leading blanks are significant, and
*        case is also significant unless the group has been marked as
*        case insensitive by calling GRP_SETCS.
*     IGRP2 = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP identifier for the created group. Returned equal to
*        GRP__NOID if an error occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*        CMN_CHARS( GRP__MAXG ) = CHARACTER*(GRP__NCHAR) (Read and Write)
*           The control characters used to define the syntax of group
*           expressions. A set of characters stored in a single string
*           for each group. The order is defined by global constants
*           GRP__PINDC, GRP__PDELC, GRP__PCOMC, etc (see GRP_PAR).
*        CMN_FLSIZ( GRP__MAXG ) = INTEGER (Read)
*           The size of the FILES array associated with each group.
*        CMN_GSIZE( GRP__MAXG ) = INTEGER (Read)
*           The index of the last entry in each group.
*        CMN_TYPE( GRP__MAXG ) = CHARACTER (Read)
*           Group types.
*        CMN_UPPER( GRP__MAXG ) = LOGICAL (Read and Write)
*           If true, then all names in the group should be converted
*           to upper case before being used. Otherwise, they are left
*           as they are.
