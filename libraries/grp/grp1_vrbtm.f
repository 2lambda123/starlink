      SUBROUTINE GRP1_VRBTM( SLOT, GEXP, VERB, GRPEXP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_VRBTM

*  Purpose:
*     Escape any control characters within verbatim sections of the
*     supplied group expression.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_VRBTM( SLOT, GEXP, VERB, GRPEXP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine searches the supplied group expression for the
*     strings "<!!" (which marks the start of a verbatim section) and
*     "!!>" (which marks the end of a verbatim section). A modified form
*     of the supplied group expression is created in which:
*
*     1) any control characters located within a verbatim section are
*     preceeded by an escape character. If no escape character is defined
*     for the group, then the control characters will NOT be escaped.
*
*     2) the srings marking the start or end of a verbatim section are
*     removed.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP slot number for the group.
*     GEXP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The group expression to be checked.
*     VERB = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Indicates whether or not we are currently within a verbatim
*        section.
*     GRPEXP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The modified group expression.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
