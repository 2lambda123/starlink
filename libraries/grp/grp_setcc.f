      SUBROUTINE GRP_SETCC( IGRP, CCLIST, CC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_SETCC

*  Purpose:
*     Sets requested control characters for the specified group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_SETCC( IGRP, CCLIST, CC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Each group has associated with it several "control characters"
*     which are the characters used to indicate various items of syntax
*     within a group expression. These characters are listed and
*     described in the "Notes" section below. The control characters are
*     given default values when the group is created, but can be changed
*     at any time by calling this routine.
*
*     Checks for particular control characters may be suppressed by
*     assigning the NULL character to them. The NULL character is
*     itself a control character which may be assigned a value using
*     this routine. Some control characters form pairs, and an error is
*     reported if only one member of a pair is assigned the NULL value.
*     These pairs are OPEN_NEST and CLOSE_NEST, and OPEN_KERNEL and
*     CLOSE_KERNEL.
*
*     If a blank value for argument CCLIST is supplied, then the default
*     control characters described in the "Notes" section are
*     re-established.
*
*     An error is reported if any two control characters are the same.
*     The exception to this is that any number of control characters
*     may have the same value as the NULL control character. If any
*     error occurs, the control characters are left unaltered.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the group to which the control characters
*        refer.
*     CCLIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A comma separated list of names specifying which control
*        character are to be altered. Unambiguous abbreviations may be
*        used. A blank value causes all control characters to be reset
*        to the default values.
*     CC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A list of the new control characters, in the same order as the
*        corresponding names in CCLIST. Note, if CCLIST contains N
*        names, then the first N characters are used out of the string
*        specified by CC. If the total length (including any trailing
*        blanks) of CC is less than N, then an error is reported.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The following names are used to refer to the individual control
*     characters:
*     -  INDIRECTION: (Default "^") The name given to the character used
*     to indicate that an element of a group expression is the name of a
*     text file from which further elements should be read.
*     -  COMMENT: (Default "#") The name given to the character used to
*     introduce comments in group expressions.
*     -  DELIMITER: (Default ",") The name given to the character used
*     to delimit elements within group expressions. Note, delimiters
*     within group expressions are ignored if they occur within matched
*     nesting characters (see OPEN_NEST and CLOSE_NEST below).
*     -  NAME_TOKEN: (Default "*") The name given to the character used
*     as a token for input names in a modification element.
*     -  SEPARATOR: (Default "|") The name given to the character used
*     to separate the substitution strings within a modification
*     element.
*     -  OPEN_NEST: (Default "(") The name given to the character used
*     to open a "nest" within a group expression. Any delimiter
*     characters occurring within matched nesting characters are ignored.
*     -  CLOSE_NEST: (Default ")") The name given to the character used
*     to close a "nest" within a group expression.
*     -  FLAG: (Default "-") The name given to a character which can
*     be appended to the end of a group expression in order to
*     "flag" that expression. The interpretation of this flag is left
*     up to the application.
*     - OPEN_KERNEL: (Default "{") The name given to the character used
*     to open a "kernel" within a group expression.
*     - CLOSE_KERNEL: (Default "}") The name given to the character used
*     to close a "kernel" within a group expression.
*     -  NULL: (Default "%") The name given to the character which can
*     be assigned to other control characters to suppress checks for
*     those control characters. If this is changed, any other characters
*     currently set to the null character are also changed to the new NULL
*     character.
*     - ESCAPE: (Default to the NULL character) The name given to the 
*     character which can be used to escape control characters within 
*     a group expression.
