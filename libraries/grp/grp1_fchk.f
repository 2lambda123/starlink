      SUBROUTINE GRP1_FCHK( SLOT, GRPEXP, FLAG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_FCHK

*  Purpose:
*     See if a group expression is flagged, and remove comments.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_FCHK( SLOT, GRPEXP, FLAG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Any string following a comment character is removed from the 
*     supplied group exression (along with the comment character 
*     itself). The last non-blank character of the remaining group 
*     expression is compared with the groups current flag character. 
*     If it matches, the character is removed, and FLAG is returned 
*     .TRUE. Otherwise FLAG is returned .FALSE.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        A grp slot number for the group.
*     GRPEXP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The group expression.
*     FLAG = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Returned .TRUE. if the group expression was flagged.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     18-AUG-1992 (DSB):
*        Original version
*     9-SEP-1992 (DSB):
*        Call to MSG_SETC added to set up token F.
*     13-JAN-1994 (DSB):
*        Modified to look at the last character in a group expression
*        rather than at the last element in a group (argument GRPEXP
*        added).
*     27-AUG-1999 (DSB):
*        Added control character escape facility.

*  Get the group's current escape character.

*  Get the group's current comment character.

*  supplied group expression.
