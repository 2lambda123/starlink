      SUBROUTINE GRP1_GTSLT( TYPE, SLOT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_GTSLT

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new empty group and return its index within the common
*     arrays.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_GTSLT( TYPE, SLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine finds the lowest common array index not currently in
*     use, and returns it in argument SLOT. The slot is flagged as
*     being in use. If there is no free space in the common arrays an
*     error is reported. The five mapped arrays holding the group
*     contents are then created, and pointers to them stored in common.
*     The default syntax characters are assigned to the group. Groups
*     are initially set to be case sensitive on all systems, but this
*     can be changed by calling GRP_SETCS.  If any error occurs, an
*     slot number of zero is returned.
*
*     The GRP_ system stores information describing each group in
*     arrays in common.  The same element from different arrays holds
*     information for the same group. Different elements within each
*     array hold information for different groups. The "slot" number
*     for a group is just the index into these common arrays at which
*     the information describing the group is stored. The arrays in
*     common have a lower bound of 1 and an upper bound given by
*     symbolic constant GRP__MAXG.
*
*     The common arrays hold "global" properties of each group (such as
*     the group size for instance). The actual contents of each group
*     are stored in five temporary dynamic arrays:
*
*     NAMES(SIZE) (_CHAR*GRP__SZNAM ) - The names which form the group.
*     This is a character array. The array is extended as necessary to
*     make room for new names. The current size is stored in common
*     array CMN_SIZE. Unused elements of the NAMES array are set blank.
*
*     MOD_GROUP(SIZE) (_INTEGER) - This is GRP__NOID for all names NOT
*     created by a modification element. For names created by a
*     modification element, MOD_GROUP gives the GRP identifier of the
*     group containing the name upon which this name was based.
*
*     MOD_INDEX(SIZE) (_INTEGER) - This is zero for all names not
*     created by a modification element. For names created by a
*     modification element, MOD_INDEX gives the index of the name upon
*     which this name was based. The index refers to the group
*     identified by MOD_GROUP.
*
*     LEVEL(SIZE) (_INTEGER) - This gives the depth of indirection at
*     which the corresponding name was specified. Names given directly,
*     rather than by indirection have a value zero.
*
*     FILE_INDEX(SIZE) (_INTEGER) - This holds zero for names with
*     indirection level of zero. For other names, it gives the
*     index into another array (called the FILES array) at which the
*     specification of the file in which the name was given is stored.
*     The FILES array is created by routine GRP1_PTIND when the first
*     indirection element is found.
*
*     Pointers to all these mapped arrays are stored in common. The
*     arrays are kept permanently mapped until the group is deleted.

*  Arguments:
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A description of the contents of the group.
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The slot number for the new group. Set to zero if an error
*        occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
