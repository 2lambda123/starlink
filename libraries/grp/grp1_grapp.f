      SUBROUTINE GRP1_GRAPP( SLOT1, SLOT2, GEXP, FLAG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_GRAPP

*  Purpose:
*     Append a set of names specified by a group expression, to an
*     existing group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_GRAPP( SLOT1, SLOT2, GEXP, FLAG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine splits the supplied group expression up into
*     elements and replaces any indirection elements of modification
*     elements with the corresponding list of explicit names. Any
*     editing specified in the supplied group expression is applied to
*     the resulting names, which are then appended to the end of the
*     group given by SLOT2. A flag is returned indicating if the group
*     expression was terminated with the current flag control character
*     defined for SLOT2.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number for an existing group to be used as the basis
*        for an output group. If zero is given for SLOT1 then no check
*        is made for modification elements.  If any are given, they
*        will be treated as a single literal name.
*     SLOT2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number for the group to which the names are to be
*        appended. The group must previously have been created by a
*        call to GRP1_GTSLT.
*     GEXP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The group expression specifying the names to be appended to
*        the group specified by SLOT2 (see SUN/150 for a description of
*        the format of group expressions). It is assumed that this
*        group expression was supplied at an "indirection depth" of
*        zero (i.e. it was NOT supplied in a text file, but as a direct
*        response to a parameter prompt or as a subroutine argument).
*     FLAG = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if the last name in the group expression is terminated by
*        the current "flag" character for group SLOT2. Note, if
*        present, the flag character is removed from the last element
*        of the returned group.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
