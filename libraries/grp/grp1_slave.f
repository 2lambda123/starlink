      SUBROUTINE GRP1_SLAVE( ISLOT, IGRP, SLAVE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_SLAVE

*  Purpose:
*     See if a group is a slave of another group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_SLAVE( ISLOT, IGRP, SLAVE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A check is made to see if the group identified by ISLOT is a slave
*     of the group identified by IGRP, and SLAVE is returned true if
*     it is. The check is recursive, that is SLAVE is returned true if
*     IGRP is the owner of a group which is the owner of ISLOT (etc).

*  Arguments:
*     ISLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number of the group to be checked.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the owner group. Assumed valid.
*     SLAVE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Returned true if the group identified by ISLOT is a direct, or
*        indirect slave of the group identified by IGRP, or if IGRP and
*        ISLOT identify the same group. Returned false otherwise.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Arguments Given:
