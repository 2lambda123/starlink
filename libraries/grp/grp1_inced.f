      SUBROUTINE GRP1_INCED( SLOT2, FIRST, LAST, GRPEXP, START, KSTART,

*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_INCED

*  Purpose:
*     Incorporate editing specifications into a name

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_INCED( SLOT2, FIRST, LAST, GRPEXP, START, KSTART, KEND,
*                      NEXT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     All elements stored in the group given by SLOT2 with indices
*     between FIRST and LAST (inclusive) are modified by the addition
*     of a prefix and a suffix, derived from the supplied group
*     expression.  The prefix is any string occuring between index
*     START and KSTART.  The suffix is any string occuring between
*     index KEND and NEXT.
     
*  Arguments:
*     SLOT2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number for the group containing the elements to be
*        modified.
*     FIRST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the first element within the group to be modified.
*     LAST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the last element within the group to be modified.
*     GRPEXP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The group expression.
*     START = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the first character to be considered in the
*        supplied group expression.
*     KSTART = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the first character in the kernel from which the
*        elements being modified are derived.
*     KEND = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the last character in the kernel from which the
*        elements being modified are derived.
*     NEXT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the element delimiter which follows the kernel. If
*        this is supplied as zero, then it is assumed that there is no
*        delimiter following the kernel.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
