      SUBROUTINE GRP_INFOI( IGRP, INDEX, ITEM, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP_INFOI

*  Purpose:
*     Retrieve an item of integer information about a name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP_INFOI( IGRP, INDEX, ITEM, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns an item of integer information about a
*     single name from a group. The item can be any one of those
*     described under argument ITEM.
*
*     It can also return the current number of active GRP identifiers.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP group identifier.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        An index within the group specified by IGRP.  If the supplied
*        value is outside the bounds of the group, then a "null" value
*        is returned for VALUE as described below, and an error is
*        reported.
*     ITEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of an item of information. This can be any of the
*        following (abbreviations are not allowed):
*
*        MODGRP  -  If the name was specified by means of a
*        modification element, then the the GRP identifier of the group
*        used as a basis for the modification element is returned in
*        VALUE. If the name was not specified by a modification
*        element, then GRP__NOID is returned.  If INDEX is outside the
*        bounds of the group, then a value of GRP__NOID is returned.
*
*        MODIND  -  If the name was specified by means of a
*        modification element, then the index of the original name
*        (upon which the returned name was based) is returned in VALUE.
*        This is an index into the group identified by MODGRP. If
*        MODGRP is returned equal to GRP__NOID, then MODIND will be
*        zero.
*
*        DEPTH  -  The number of levels of indirection at which the
*        name was specified is returned in VALUE. Names given
*        explicitly within a group expression have a DEPTH value of
*        zero. Names given explicitly within a DEPTH zero indirection
*        element have DEPTH 1. Names given explicitly within a DEPTH 1
*        indirection element, have DEPTH 2, etc. If INDEX is out of
*        bounds, then zero is returned.
*
*        NGRP - The number of GRP group identifiers currently in use.
*        The values of the IGRP and INDEX arguments are ignored. 
*
*        ACTIVE - Like "NGRP", except that in addition to returning the
*        number of GRP group identifiers currently in use, the numerical
*        identifier values are also listed on standard output (using
*        MSG_OUT).
*
*     VALUE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The requested item of information.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
