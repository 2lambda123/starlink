      SUBROUTINE GRP1_IDELE( SLOT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_IDELE

*  Purpose:
*     Delete a group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_IDELE( SLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     It is assumed that the supplied GRP slot is currently in
*     use. All mapped array associated with the group are unmapped. The
*     slot number is flagged as no longer being in use.
*
*     Note, this routine executes even if STATUS is bad on entry.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP slot number of the group to be deleted.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
