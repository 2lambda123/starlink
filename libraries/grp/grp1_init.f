*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_INIT

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise the GRP common blocks.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     BLOCK DATA

*  Description:
*     All GRP slot numbers are set un-used. The group expression
*     control character names are established.

*  Type Definitions:
      IMPLICIT NONE              ! No implicit typing

*  Global Constants:
      INCLUDE 'SAE_PAR'          ! Standard SAE constants.
      INCLUDE 'GRP_CONST'        ! GRP private constants.
      INCLUDE 'GRP_PAR'          ! GRP public constants.
      INCLUDE 'GRP_ERR'          ! GRP error constants (including
                                 ! facility number)

*  Global Variables:
      INCLUDE 'GRP_COM'          ! GRP common blocks.
*        CMN_CCNAM( GRP__NCHAR ) = CHARACTER*(GRP__SZWRD) (Write)
*           The names which are used to refer to each control character.
*        CMN_IDCNT = INTEGER (Write)
*           Count of slot numbers issued so far.
*        CMN_IDCTX = INTEGER (Write)
*           Current slot number context level.
*        CMN_USED( GRP__MAXG ) = LOGICAL (Write)
*           True if the corresponding common array slot is in use.

*  Local Variables:
      INTEGER I                  ! Implicit loop count.

*  Global Data:
*  Indicate that no slots within the common arrays are currently used.
      DATA (CMN_USED( I ), I = 1, GRP__MAXG) / GRP__MAXG*.FALSE. /

*  Set the count of slot numbers issued so far to a random number
*  (actually the GRP facility number).
      DATA CMN_IDCNT / GRP__FAC /

*  Set the current slot number context level to 1.
      DATA CMN_IDCTX / 1 /

*  Set up the control character names.
