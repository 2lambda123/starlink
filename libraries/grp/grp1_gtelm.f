      SUBROUTINE GRP1_GTELM( SLOT, INDEX, NAME, LEVEL, IFILE, MODGP,
     :                       MODIN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_GTELM

*  Purpose:
*     Get an element from a group, including supplementary information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_GTELM( SLOT, INDEX, NAME, LEVEL, IFILE, MODGP,
*                      MODIN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine retrieves the information describing a given element
*     from the group identified by SLOT. If the supplied index is
*     outside the bounds of the group, a blank value is returned for
*     NAME.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP slot number for the group from which information is to
*        be retrieved.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the group of the element which is to be
*        retrieved.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The text retrieved from the NAMES array.
*     LEVEL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The indirection depth at which the name was specified. Zero
*        is returned if the name was given directly, instead of by
*        an indirection element.
*     IFILE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index within the FILES array at which the name of the
*        indirection file in which the name was specified is stored. A
*        value of zero is returned if the name was given directly,
*        instead of by an indirection element.
*     MODGP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP identifier of the group used as a basis for the name if
*        it was created as a result of a modification element. A value
*        of GRP__NOID is returned if the name was not created as a
*        result of a modification element.
*     MODIN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index within the group specified by MODGP, of the name
*        used as a basis for the returned name. A value of zero is
*        returned if the name was not created as a result of a
*        modification element.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
