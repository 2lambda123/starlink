*  Name:
*     GRP1_IPUT

*  Purpose:
*     Store group information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_IPUT( INDEX, SIZE, NAMES, LEVELS, IFILES, MODGPS,
*                     MODINS, NAME, LEVEL, IFILE, MODGP, MODIN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine stores the given information relating to a member of
*     a group, in the corresponding GROUP structure arrays.

*  Arguments:
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the group at which the information is to be
*        stored.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the GROUP structure arrays.
*     NAMES(SIZE) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The NAMES array.
*     LEVELS(SIZE) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The LEVEL array.
*     IFILES(SIZE) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The FILE_INDEX  array.
*     MODGPS(SIZE) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The MOD_GROUP  array.
*     MODINS(SIZE) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The MOD_INDEX  array.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The text to be stored in the NAMES array.
*     LEVEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The indirection depth at which the name was specified. Zero
*        should be given if the name was given directly, instead of by
*        an indirection element.
*     IFILE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the FILES array (see routine GRP1_PTIND) at
*        which the name of the indirection file in which the name was
*        specified is stored. A value of zero should be given if the
*        name was given directly, instead of by an indirection element.
*     MODGP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identifier for the group used as a basis for the name
*        if it was created as a result of a modification element. A
*        value of GRP__NOID should be given if the name was not created
*        as a result of a modification element.
*     MODIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the group specified by MODGP, of the name
*        used as a basis for the name given by argument NAME.  If MODGP
*        is given as GRP__NOID, then MODIN is ignored.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
