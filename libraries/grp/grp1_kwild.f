*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_KWILD

*  Purpose:
*     Enclose NAME_TOKEN characters within kernel delimiters.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_KWILD( SLOT, GEXP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Any NAME_TOKEN characters within the supplied group expression are
*     enclosed within a pair of OPEN_KERNEL and CLOSE_KERNEL control
*     characters.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number of the group whose control characters are to be
*        used.
*     GEXP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The group expression,
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
