      SUBROUTINE GRP1_ELEMS( SLOT, GRPEXP, DEPTH, IFILE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_ELEMS

*  Purpose:
*     Store the elements within a group expression in the associated
*     group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_ELEMS( SLOT, GRPEXP, DEPTH, IFILE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The given group expression is divided into elements, and each
*     element is appended to the end of the group identified by SLOT.
*     The group is extended if necessary to make room for the new
*     elements.  Any text occurring within the group expression after a
*     comment character is ignored. Element delimiters occurring within
*     matching nesting characters are ignored.
*
*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The slot number for the group to which the group expression
*        refers. The group must previously have been created by
*        a call to GRP1_GTSLT.
*     GRPEXP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A group expression specifying names to be appended to the
*        given group (see SUN/150 for a description of the format of
*        group expressions).
*     DEPTH = INTEGER (Given)
*        The depth of indirection at which the group expression was
*        given. A depth of zero implies that the group expression was
*        given directly (no indirection).
*     IFILE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the FILES array (see routine GRP1_PTIND) at
*        which the name of the indirection file in which the given group
*        expression was found is stored. A value of zero should be given
*        if the group expression was not contained within an indirection
*        file.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
