*  Name:
*     GRP1_FIND

*  Purpose:
*     Find a name in a character array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_FIND( UPPER, SIZE, START, ARRAY, TEXT, INDEX, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The array is searched (starying at START) for the given text, and
*     the index of the first occurrence returned. If the text is not
*     found an index of zero is returned. The search is case
*     insensitive if argument UPPER is supplied true.

*  Arguments:
*     UPPER = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then strings comparisons are case insensitive.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the array specified by argument ARRAY.
*     START = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lowest index to be checked.
*     ARRAY( SIZE ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The array.
*     TEXT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The text to be searched for.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index at which the text was found within ARRAY. A value of
*        zero is returned if the text is not found.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
