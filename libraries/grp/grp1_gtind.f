      SUBROUTINE GRP1_GTIND( SLOT, INDEX, FILE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GRP1_GTIND

*  Purpose:
*     Get an indirection file name from the list of indirection file
*     names used by the specified group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GRP1_GTIND( SLOT, INDEX, FILE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine retrieves the indirection file name stored at the
*     given index in the FILES array associated with the group
*     identified by SLOT. If an index of zero is supplied, a blank
*     string is returned. Any other out-of-bounds index causes an
*     error to be reported.

*  Arguments:
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP slot number for the group to which the indirection file
*        related.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the FILES array at which the required
*        indirection file name is stored. An error is reported if this
*        is outside the range of the array.
*     FILE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The file name stored at the requested index within the FILES
*        array. A blank value is returned if an error occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
