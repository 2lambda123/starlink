/*
*  Name:
*     grp1.h

*  Purpose:
*     Defines the C interface to the GRP library, including the private
*     Grp structure.

*  Description:
*     This module defines the C interface to the GRP library for use
*     internally within GRP. It defines the public interface, plus the
*     private Grp structure. C source files within GRP should include
*     this file rather than "grp.h". This file should not be installed.

*  Authors:
*     DSB: David .S. Berry (UCLan)
*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)

*  History:
*     2-MAR-2006 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     7-AUG-2006 (TIMJ):
*        GRP__NOID is a private definition.
*     6-NOV-2007 (TIMJ):
*        Fix compiler error from confusion of C GRP__NOID with Fortran
*        GRP__NOID.
