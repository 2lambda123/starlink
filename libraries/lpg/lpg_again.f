      LOGICAL FUNCTION LPG_AGAIN( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     LPG_AGAIN

*  Purpose:
*     Decide if the application should be executed again.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = LPG_AGAIN( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine is used to allow multiple invocations of an application
*     within an Starlink monolith to process a group of data files. The
*     initialization routine LPG_START should be called prior to this
*     routine. This routine returns a logical flag indicating if the
*     application should be invoked again. A typical way to use this
*     routine within a monolith is as follows:

*        CALL LPG_START( VERB, DELAY, DISAB, STATUS )
*        DO WHILE ( LPG_AGAIN( STATUS ) )
*           IF ( ACTION .EQ. 'ADD' ) THEN
*              CALL ADD( STATUS )
*           ELSE IF ( ACTION .EQ. 'SUB' ) THEN
*              CALL SUB( STATUS )
*           ELSE IF...
*           ...
*           END IF
*        END DO

*     The application corresponding to the required action will always be
*     invoked once. The applications should use the routines LPG_ASSOC,
*     LPG_PROP, LPG_CREAT and LPG_CREP to get identifier for NDFs, in
*     place of the corresponding routines from the NDF library.
*
*     For catalogues, routines LPG_CATASSOC and LPG_CATCREAT should be
*     used in place of CAT_ASSOC and CAT_CREAT.
*
*     LPG_AGAIN returns a .TRUE. value until a group of data files is
*     exhausted, where-upon it deletes all its groups and returns a
*     .FALSE. value.
*
*     On the first invocation of the application, groups of data files are
*     obtained whenever one of the above LPG routines is used to get an NDF
*     or CAT identifier, and an identifier corresponding to the first name in
*     each group is returned to the application. On subsequent invocations,
*     the names in the groups obtained during the first invocation are used
*     without obtaining new parameter values from the environment. The
*     index of the returned data file within each group is increment by 1
*     each time the application is invoked.
*
*     If an application is invoked more than once, all other parameters
*     retain the values they had at the end of the first invocation.
*     Applications that use this scheme should avoid having parameters
*     with "VPATH=DYNAMIC" in the interface file, since the dynamic
*     default calculated on the first invocation will then be re-used for
*     all subsequent invocations, which may be inappropriate. A better
*     scheme is to have "VPATH=DEFAULT", "PPATH=DYNAMIC" and "DEFAULT=!".
*     The code should then annul any PAR__NULL status after accessing
*     the parameter, and use the previously calculated dynamic default
*     value for the parameter. With this scheme, the parameter value is
*     "!" at the end of the first invocation, and so retains this value
*     for all subsequent invocations, resulting in appropriate dynamic
*     defaults being used.
*
*     A situation in which the above suggestion does not work is if an
*     application sometimes sets a dynamic default, and sometimes doesn't.
*     In this case, you do not want to have VPATH=DEFAULT,DEFAULT=! because
*     this would require the application to abort in the cases where there
*     is no dynamic default available. It is probably better in these
*     cases to have VPATH=PROMPT,PPATH=DYNAMIC and accept the fact that
*     the user will be prompted for a parameter that was previously
*     defaulted.
*
*     Some applications test to see if a parameter was specified on the
*     command line, and vary their behaviour accordingly. This is done
*     by checking the state of the parameter before accessing it, a
*     state of PAR__ACTIVE (or SUBPAR__ACTIVE) indicating that the
*     parameter already has a value. This is correct on the first
*     invocation, but not on subsequent invocations because the first
*     invocation may have set a parameter value, resulting in subsequent
*     invocations thinking that the parameter was given on the command
*     line. To avoid this, applications should use LPG_STATE in place of
*     PAR_STATE. LPG_STATE remembers the state of the parameter on the
*     first invocation, and returns that state, rather than the current
*     parameter state, on subsequent invocations.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     LPG_AGAIN = LOGICAL
*        .TRUE. if the application should be executed again.
