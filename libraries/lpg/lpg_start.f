      SUBROUTINE LPG_START( VERBO, DELAYO, DISABO, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     LPG_START

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise the contents of the LPG common blocks.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LPG_START( VERBO, DELAYO, DISABO, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Initialises the global variables used by LPG. See LPG_AGAIN.

*  Arguments:
*     VERBO = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE. then the name of the data file being used for each
*        parameter will be displayed on each invocation of the
*        application at the point where the parameter is accessed.
*        Parameters which are not multi-valued (i.e. that are associated
*        with the same data file on all invocations) are not displayed.
*        In addition, a blank line will be displayed on the screen
*        between each invocation of the application. No text is displayed
*        if VERB is .FALSE..
*     DELAYO = REAL (Given)
*        Put a delay of DELAY seconds between invocations.
*     DISABO = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., the looping facilities are disabled. LPG_AGAIN 
*        returns .TRUE. only on the first invocation, and LPG_ASSOC, 
*        LPG_CREAT, LPG_PROP, LPG_CREP, LPG_CATASSOC and LPG_CATCREAT 
*        make simple calls to the corresponding NDF or CAT routine.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*        PNAME( LPG__MXPAR ) = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZNAM ) (Write)
*           The names of the NDF parameters used by the application.
*        PNAME2( LPG__MXPAR ) = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZNAM ) (Write)
*           The names of non-NDF parameters used by the application.
*        IGRP( LPG__MXPAR ) = INTEGER (Write)
*           The identifier for the GRP groups holding the NDF names 
*           supplied for each NDF parameter.
*        SIZE( LPG__MXPAR ) = INTEGER (Write)
*           The number of NDFs supplied for each NDF parameter.
*        NPAR = INTEGER (Write)
*           The number of NDF parameters used by the application.
*        NPAR2 = INTEGER (Write)
*           The number of non-NDF parameters used by the application.
*        NRUN = INTEGER (Write)
*           The number of times the application has been invoked so far.
*        OLD( LPG__MXPAR ) = LOGICAL (Write)
*           A flag for each NDF parameter indicating if the parameter is 
*           used to access existing (i.e. old) NDFs. If not, the parameter 
*           is used to access new NDFs to be created by the application.
*        REP( LPG__MXPAR ) = LOGICAL (Write)
*           A flag for each NDF parameter indicating if the parameter value 
*           has been reported yet by the current invocation of the
*           application.
*        STATE2( LPG__MXPAR ) = INTEGER (Write)
*           The original (i.e. before the first invocation was performed) 
*           PAR state of each parameter listed in array PNAME2.
*        VERB = LOGICAL (Write)
*           Run in verbose mode, displaying the name of each NDF as it is
*           used?
*        DELAY = REAL (Write)
*           Delay between invocations, in seconds.
*        DISAB = LOGICAL (Write)
*           Disable looping?
*        TMPLST = INTEGER (Read and Write)
*           A GRP identifier for a group holding the full specification
*           for any temporary output NDFs created during the previous
*           invocation of the application. A temporary output NDF is
*           created if the output NDF requested by the user may already
*           be open by the NDF system. In this case the temporary NDF
*           is copied to the requested position once the application has
*           finished.  The TMPLST group holds adjacent pairs of file
*           specs; the first one in each pair is the spec of the temporary 
*           output NDF, the second is the spec of the requested output NDF.
*        OPNLST = INTEGER (Read and Write)
*           A GRP identifier for a group holding the full specification
*           for any existing NDFs which have been opened for read-only
*           input by this invocation of the application. 
*        REPLACE = LOGICAL (Read)
*           Should the user be allowed to use the same input as both
*           input and output? If so, a temporary NDF will be used to
*           store the output while the application is running. Once the
*           application has finsished, the existing input NDF will be
*           replaced by a copy of the temporary NDF. If REPLACE is false
*           an error will be reported if an attempt is amde to use a
*           single NDF as both input and output.
