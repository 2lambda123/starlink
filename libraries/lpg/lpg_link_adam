#  Name:
#     lpg_link

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking standalone version
#     of IRQ library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building standalone
#     applications which use LPG in order to generate the correct
#     arguments for the compiler (or ld) command. The arguments
#     generated are written to the standard output.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a compiler command line,
#     such as:
#
#        f77 -o program -L$STARLINK_DIR/lib `lpg_link` program.f
