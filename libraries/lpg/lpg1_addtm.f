      SUBROUTINE LPG1_ADDTM( IGRP1, INDX, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     LPG1_ADDTM

*  Purpose:
*     Copy temporary output NDFs totheir correct location.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LPG1_ADDTM( IGRP1, INDX, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine replaces an output NDF name with a temporary NDF name
*     if the output NDF is already being used as an input NDF. It also
*     saves the association between the requested NDF and the temporary
*     NDF in a GRP group.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identifier for an NDG group holding the requested output
*        NDF specification.
*     INDX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within IGRP1 of the output NDF specification.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*        TMPLST = INTEGER (Read)
*           A GRP identifier for a group holding the full specification
*           for any temporary output NDFs created during the previous
*           invocation of the application. A temporary output NDF is
*           created if the output NDF requested by the user may already
*           be open by the NDF system. In this case the temporary NDF
*           is copied to the requested position once the application has
*           finished.  The TMPLST group holds adjacent pairs of file
*           specs; the first one in each pair is the spec of the temporary
*           output NDF, the second is the spec of the requested output NDF.
*        OPNLST = INTEGER (Read)
*           A GRP identifier for a group holding the full specification
*           for any existing NDFs which have been opened for read-only
*           input by this invocation of the application.
*        REPLACE = LOGICAL (Read)
*           Should the user be allowed to use the same input as both
*           input and output? If so, a temporary NDF will be used to
*           store the output while the application is running. Once the
*           application has finsished, the existing input NDF will be
*           replaced by a copy of the temporary NDF. If REPLACE is false
*           an error will be reported if an attempt is amde to use a
*           single NDF as both input and output.
