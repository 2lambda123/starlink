#  Name:
#     idi_dev

#  Purpose:
#     Create links to IDI include files.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script sets up (or removes) symbolic links in the current
#     working directory which refer to IDI public include files. 
#     It exists to allow source code which contains references to the
#     standard public IDI include files to be compiled without 
#     having to know where these files actually reside.

#  Invocation:
#     idi_dev
#        Sets up links for all ths IDI public include files.
#     idi_dev remove
#        Removes the links previously set up.

#  Notes:
#     The pathname of the installation include directory (/star/include)
#     must be edited into this script when it is installed.  This is 
#     normally done by the standard Starlink makefile.
