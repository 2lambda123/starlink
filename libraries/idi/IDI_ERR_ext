* Note: IDI__OK status added manually since it must always
*       match SAI__OK

*     Normal status
      INTEGER IDI__OK
      PARAMETER ( IDI__OK = 0 )

* IDI__VD_DEVNULL added for backwards compatibility reasons.
* since the C library has been using VD_NULLDEV and the Fortran
* include files used VD_DEVNULL. Presumably Fortran code is not
* using the C version so we have to provide both.

*     Environment device name not defined
      INTEGER IDI__DEVNULL
      PARAMETER (IDI__DEVNULL = IDI__NULLDEV)
