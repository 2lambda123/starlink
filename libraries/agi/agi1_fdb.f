      SUBROUTINE AGI_1FDB ( FOUND, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_1FDB

*  Purpose:
*     Find the database.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1FDB ( FOUND, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Get a locator to the database container file if it is there.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     If this is the first call to AGI_1FDB then
*        See if HDS has been started
*        If it hasn't been started then
*           Start HDS locator facility
*        Endif
*        Initialise the database cache.
*        Set a flag ( and save it ) to ensure this section is not repeated.
*     Endif
*     See if the locator in the common block is valid
*     If it is then the database is already open so set found to true
*     Else see if a database file exists
*        Open the database file
*        Set found to false if an error has occured in this section
