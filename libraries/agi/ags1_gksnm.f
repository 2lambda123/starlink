      SUBROUTINE AGS_1GKSNM ( WKID, CONID, GNAME, STRLEN, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGS_1GKSNM

*  Purpose:
*     Make up a GKS name string from the wkid and conid.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGS_1GKSNM( WKID, CONID, GNAME, STRLEN, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine makes up a GKS name from the workstation id and
*     the connection id. The name is made up as 'GKS_<wkid>_<conid>'.
*     The resulting name can be used to open SGS on the particular
*     device.

*  Algorithm:
*     Convert the workstation and connection identifiers to character
*     strings.
*     Append these onto the prefix and calculate the string length.

*  Arguments Returned:
*     GKS name for the device

*   Write the WKID and CONID into character strings
         WRITE( SWKID,  '( I10 )' ) WKID
