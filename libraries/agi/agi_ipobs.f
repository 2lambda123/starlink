      SUBROUTINE AGI_IPOBS ( PICID, LOBS, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_IPOBS
*
*  Purpose:
*     Is current picture obscured by another?
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_IPOBS( PICID, LOBS, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     Inquire if the current picture is obscured, either totally or
*     partially by another picture. Obscured means that a picture
*     intersects the current picture and was created more recently.
*     If the input value for the picture identifier is negative the
*     current picture is tested against all other overlying pictures;
*     i.e. those created more recently than the current picture. If the
*     picture identifier corresponds to a valid picture then the current
*     one is only tested against the given one.
*
*  Arguments:
*     PICID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Picture identifier.
*     LOBS = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if picture is obscured, otherwise false.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
*
*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     Get details of the current picture.
*     Get a locator to the top level database structure.
*     Get a locator to the workstation.
*     Inquire the number of pictures on the workstation.
*     Get a locator to the given picture.
*     Read the device coordinates of this picture.
*     If the test is against all pictures then
*        Set the obscuration flag to false.
*        Set the picture counter to the total number of pictures.
*        Do while the picture is not obscured, and the picture counter
*        is less than the picture number.
*           Get a locator to the picture indicated by the picture counter.
*           Read the device coodrdinates of this picture.
*           If the pictures overlap indicate that the picture is obsured.
*           Decrement the picture counter.
*        Enddo
*     Else
*        Read the device coordinates of the given picture.
*        See if this overlaps the current picture.
*     Endif
*     Tidy up.
