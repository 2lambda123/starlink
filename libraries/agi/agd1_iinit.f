      SUBROUTINE AGD_1IINIT ( STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGD_1IINIT

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise the IDI parameter common blocks.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGD_1IINIT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Initialise the IDI parameter common blocks which contain the
*     values of the zoom and scroll factors for the memories.
*     The definitions are held in the INCLUDE file 'AGI_IDIPS'.

*  Algorithm:
*     Set all thje values to zero. For the zoom and scroll factors
*     these are valid vaules which indicate the default display;
*     i.e. no zoom and the display origin in the bottom left hand
*     corner.
