      SUBROUTINE AGI_1DEFBA ( WKNAME, AGINAM, DEVICE, NDC, WORLD,
     :                        STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_1DEFBA
*
*  Purpose:
*     Define the coordinates of the base picture
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1DEFBA( WKNAME, AGINAM, DEVICE, NDC, WORLD, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     This defines the coordinate system of the base picture for the
*     given workstation. The coordinate system is obtained from the
*     GKS desciption of the device and therfore the workstation name
*     or the AGI name must translate into a GKS type.
*     The device, normalised device and world coordinates of the base
*     picture are returned.
*
*  Arguments:
*     WKNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Workstation name
*     AGINAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        AGI name
*     DEVICE = REAL ( 4 ) (Returned)
*        Device coordinates of base picture
*     NDC = REAL ( 4 ) (Returned)
*        Normalised device coordinates of base picture
*     WORLD = REAL ( 4 ) (Returned)
*        World coordinates of base picture
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
*
*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     Get the GKS workstation identifier for the current picture.
*     If GKS is closed then open it.
*     If the device is an input/output device then
*        Inquire the device size.
*     Else
*        Assume a square display for a metafile or segment.
*     Endif
*     Close GKS if it was opened in this routine.
*     Define the device, ndc and world coordinates for the base picture.

*  History:
*     Oct 1988 (NE):
*        Original version
*     Jun 1990 (NE):
*        Added AGINAM to argument list
*     Dec 1990 (NE):
*        Use raster units from GQDSP
*     Feb 1992 (NE):
*        GKS 7.4 version
*     Jul 1992 (NE):
*        Test status from all GKS inquiry routines.
*        Calculate NDC's from display size rather than raster units.
*     Oct 1992 (NE):
*        Improve error reporting
