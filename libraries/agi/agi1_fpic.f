      SUBROUTINE AGI_1FPIC ( PSTLOC, PICNUM, PICLOC, FOUND, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_1FPIC

*  Purpose:
*     Find a picture in a picture structure.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1FPIC( PSTLOC, PICNUM, PICLOC, FOUND, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Find a picture in a picture stucture.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     Inquire the current number of pictures in the array of pictures.
*     If number less than given picture number
*     or picture number less than one then
*        Indicate picture not found.
*     Else
*        Get locator to picture cell.
*     Endif
