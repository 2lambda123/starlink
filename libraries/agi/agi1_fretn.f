      SUBROUTINE AGI_1FRETN ( FRELEN, FREEID, FRELIS, NEXFRE, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_1FRETN

*  Purpose:
*     Return a member to the free list.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1FRETN ( FRELEN, FREEID, FRELIS, NEXFRE )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Return a member to the free list. The FRELIS and NEXFRE are
*     updated. If the element is already free then an error status is
*     returned. The FRELIS element pointed to by FREEID is filled with
*     NEXFRE, and then FREEID is copied into NEXFRE. For example if the
*     contents were
*     --------------          --------------          -----------------
*     | FREEID | 6 |          | NEXFRE | 3 |          | FRELIS(3) | 9 |
*     --------------          --------------          -----------------
*                                                     .               .
*                                                     ------------------
*                                                     | FRELIS(6) | -2 |
*                                                     ------------------
*     Then the result will be
*                --------------          -----------------
*                | NEXFRE | 6 |          | FRELIS(3) | 9 |
*                --------------          -----------------
*                                        .               .
*                                        -----------------
*                                        | FRELIS(6) | 3 |
*                                        -----------------
