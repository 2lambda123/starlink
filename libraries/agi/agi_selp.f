*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_SELP
*
*  Purpose:
*     Select the given picture as the current one
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_SELP( PICID, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     Select the given picture as the current one.
*
*  Arguments:
*     PICID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Picture identifier
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
*
*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     Verify the picture identifier.
*     Save the identifier in the common block and in the database.
*     Release any previously deferred pictures.
