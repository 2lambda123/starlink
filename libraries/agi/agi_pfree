*   This contains the common blocks for the picture identifier free
*   list and storage space.
*   The picture identifier is just a pointer into the storage space
*   and they are allocated by the next member of the free list.
*   When picture identifiers are released the free list should be updated.
*   The end of the free list is recognised by a negative number.
*   The free list is initialised by AGI_FINIT.
*   The common block also contains an array for storing the ADAM
*   parameter name associated with the devices.
*
*   Note. Have to include 'SAE_PAR' and 'AGI_PAR' in front of this.
