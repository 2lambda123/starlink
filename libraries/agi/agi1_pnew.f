*  Name:
*     AGI_1PNEW

*  Purpose:
*     Save current picture parameters.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1PNEW( WKNAME, PNAME, COMENT, DEVICE, NDC, WORLD,

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Save current picture parameters in the database and in the cache

*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     Get a locator to the top level database structure.
*     Get a locator to the workstation.
*     Inquire how many pictures are on the workstation.
*     Make the picture number one greater than the number of pictures.
*     Create a new picture containing the passed parameters.
*     Indicate this is the active picture.
*     Write this picture into the cache.
