      SUBROUTINE AGI_1FPST ( WKSLOC, PSTLOC, FOUND, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_1FPST

*  Purpose:
*     Find the picture structure.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1FPST( WKSLOC, PSTLOC, FOUND, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Find the picture structure in the database.

*  Algorithm:
*     Initialise the returned variable.
*     Check status on entry.
*     If picture structure is in workstation then
*        Get the locator to the picture structure.
*     Endif
