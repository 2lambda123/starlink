Plan for AGI

 - Need to build AGI_ERR before anything else is built.

 - Need to change agi_par to AGI_PAR

 - Need to edit source code to change lower case AGI_PAR and AGI_ERR
   to upper case.

      perl -pi -e 's/agi_par/AGI_PAR/' *.f

 - Since AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS traverses subdirs before
   building files in current directory, the AGI_ERR  
   has to be built in a subdir first.

    Else move AGI_ERR creation to start of dependencies.

 - Everything now works if AGI_ERR is created first.

Tests are outstanding since
  1. They test with IDI
  2. They need the fortran SLEEP call and so an extra C file.
     This files is not needed if SLEEP intrinsic is available.
