      SUBROUTINE AGP_ASPEC( AGINAM, GNS, SPEC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     AGP_ASPEC

*  Purpose:
*     Find the GNS or native PGPLOT specification for an AGI workstation name.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGP_ASPEC( AGINAM, GNS, SPEC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Returns the GNS device specification for a supplied AGI workstation
*     name. If the application is linked with native PGPLOT through the
*     agp_link_adam command, the native PGPLOT device specification can
*     instead be returned by supplying .FALSE. for the GNS argument.
*
*     An error is reported if the supplied AGI workstation name is not known.

*  Arguments:
*     AGINAM = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The AGI workstation name. No abbreviations allowed.
*     GNS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Supplied .TRUE. if the GNS device specification is required, and
*        .FALSE. if the native PGPLOT device specification is required.
*        An error is reported if a native PGPLOT device specifications is
*        requested but cannot be produced (e.g. because the application
*        is not linked with native PGPLOT).
*     SPEC = CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        The returned PGPLOT or GNS device specification.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
