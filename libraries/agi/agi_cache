*   ---------
*   This contains the common blocks for the picture cache.
*   This is used for reducing the number of enquiries to the database.
*   The picture cache works on a simplified First In First Out ( FIFO )
*   principle. There are no checks to see if the FIFO is full, instead
*   the oldest member is simply overwritten.
*   An array FIFO contains picture numbers which have already been
*   cached, and a pointer PFIFO points to the most recent member.
*   When pictures are erased from the cache, the FIFO is not sorted,
*   and the pointer is not updated.
*   FIFO array is initialised with AGI_INIT
*
*   The FIFO is reproduced a number of times to further reduce the
*   search time. This is done by adding another dimension to the
*   arrays which is accessed by the FIFO number. The FIFO number is
*   constructed by hashing the picture number using the function
*   MOD( PICNUM, NFIFO ).
*
*   Note. Have to include 'SAE_PAR' and 'AGI_PAR' in front of this.
