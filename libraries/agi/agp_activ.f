*
*  Purpose:
*     Initialise PGPLOT
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGP_ACTIV( STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     Initialise PGPLOT. This has to be called before any other AGP or
*     PGPLOT routines. An error is returned if this or any other
*     graphics interface, other than AGS_, is active.
*
*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
