      SUBROUTINE AGI_1IPIC ( WKSLOC, PSTLOC, TOTNUM, FOUND, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_1IPIC

*  Purpose:
*     Inquire the number of pictures on a workstation.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1IPIC ( WKSLOC, PSTLOC, TOTNUM, FOUND, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Inquire the number of pictures on a workstation. Return the
*     picture structure locator if it was found.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     If picture structure is present then
*        Get the locator to the picture structure.
*        Inquire how many pictures are in the picture structure.
*     Endif
