1 AGI_update

  AGI Version 2.2-0

  o Encapsulated Postscript files created by native PGPLOT can now be
  merged automatically, avoiding the need to use something like psmerge.
  This is provided by some new "pseudo-device" types: /APS, /ACPS, /AVPS
  and /AVCPS.

  o A new routine AGI_TRUNC has been added which will reduce the AGI
  database file size by removing unused space.
