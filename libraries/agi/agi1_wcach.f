*  Name:
*     AGI_1WCACH

*  Purpose:
*     Write the contents of a picture into the cache.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1WCACH( WKNAME, PICNUM, PNAME, COMENT, DEVICE, NDC,

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Write the contents of a picture into the dynamic cache

*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     Update the cache pointer.
*     Delete any compiled transformations at the new pointer.
*     Write the picture contents into the cache.
*     Indicate that the transformations have not been compiled.

*     June 1989  Amended to allow for the extra FIFO's
*     Sept 1989  Annul compiled transforms in the cache
*     June 1990  Added MEMID parameter
