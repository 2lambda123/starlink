      SUBROUTINE AGD_DEASS ( PARAM, PARCAN, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGD_DEASS
*
*  Purpose :
*     Deassociate a device from AGI and IDI.
*
*  Invocation :
*     CALL AGD_DEASS( PARAM, PARCAN, STATUS )
*
*  Description :
*     This is a wrap-up routine to deassociate a device from the AGI
*     database and to close down IDI. The picture current when
*     AGD_ASSOC was called is reinstated. This routine calls AGD_DEACT,
*     AGI_END and either AGI_CANCL or AGI_ANNUL. This routine is
*     executed regardless of the given value of status.
*
*  Arguments :
*     PARAM = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter associated with the device.
*     PARCAN = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true the parameter given by PARAM is cancelled, otherwise
*        it is annulled.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*
*  Algorithm :
*     Record the input status and begin an error context.
*     Deactivate the IDI interface.
*     End the AGI context.
*     Annul any errors from the last two steps.
*     If PARCAN is true then
*        Cancel the AGI device parameter.
*     Else
*        Annul the current picture identifier.
*     Endif
*     Reinstate the input status.

*  Arguments Given :
      CHARACTER * ( * ) PARAM
      LOGICAL PARCAN

*  Status :
      INTEGER STATUS

*  Local variables :
      INTEGER ISTAT, PICID
*.

*  Record the input status and set the internal status to OK.
      ISTAT = STATUS
      STATUS = SAI__OK

*  Start a new error context to prevent error reports if there is no
*  active workstation or no current picture.
      CALL ERR_MARK

*  Deactivate IDI and close the workstation. If the workstation was
*  not activated an error results.
      CALL AGD_DEACT( STATUS )

*  Close the AGI context and reinstate the input current picture.  If
*  there is no current picture an error results.
      CALL AGI_END( -1, STATUS )

*  We do not want either error message, but want to retain the
*  original error status, if there is one.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) CALL ERR_ANNUL( STATUS )

*  Release the new error context.
      CALL ERR_RLSE

*  Close the AGI database.  Record the name of the workstation only
*  if it was used successfully.
      IF ( PARCAN ) THEN
         CALL AGI_CANCL( PARAM, STATUS )

*  Inquire the input picture identifier so that it may be annulled
*  and the database closed.
      ELSE
         CALL AGI_ICURP( PICID, STATUS )
         CALL AGI_ANNUL( PICID, STATUS )
      END IF

*  Restore the input status if nothing went wrong.
      IF ( STATUS .EQ. SAI__OK ) STATUS = ISTAT
