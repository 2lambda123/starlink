      SUBROUTINE AGI_MORE ( PICID, ACMODE, MORLOC, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_MORE
*
*  Purpose:
*     Return an HDS locator to a MORE structure
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_MORE( PICID, ACMODE, MORLOC, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     An HDS locator that points to a MORE structure in the database
*     is returned. A MORE structure can be associated with any picture
*     and it can be used to store any application specific information.
*     If the given value for PICID is negative then the current picture
*     is used. If the access mode is 'WRITE' then an empty MORE structure
*     is created if none existed. If there is an existing structure then
*     'WRITE' mode will erase the existing contents and return a locator
*     to an empty structure. If the access mode is 'READ' or 'UPDATE' then
*     a locator to an existing structure is returned. In this case an
*     error is returned if there is not a MORE structure for the given
*     picture. The database is not responsible for what goes in the MORE
*     structure or how the information is used. The application is also
*     responsible for annulling the returned locator.
*
*  Arguments:
*     PICID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Picture identifier
*     ACMODE = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Access mode for MORE structure. 'READ', 'WRITE' or 'UPDATE'.
*     MORLOC = CHARACTER*(DAT__SZLOC) (Returned)
*        Locator to the transformation structure
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
*
*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     Convert the acces mode to upper case.
*     Get details of the specified picture.
*     Get a locator to the specified picture.
*     If there is a more structure already there then
*        If the mode is WRITE then
*           Erase the existing structure and create an empty one.
*        Endif.
*        Return a locator to the more structure.
*     Else if there is no more structure
*        If the mode is WRITE then
*           Create an empty structure and return the locator.
*        Else for READ or UPDATE access
*           Return an error as there is no structure to access.
*        Endif
*     Endif
