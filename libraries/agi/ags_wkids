*   This contains the common blocks for those variables that are
*   indexed by the GKS workstation identifier. These are required
*   because, for example,  the workstation identifier on its own

*   MWKIDS specifies the maximum possible value of the GKS workstation
*   identifiers and thus the length of the arrays. SGS assigns values to
*   these identifiers between 1 and MXOPWK, where MXOPWK is returned
*   from GQWKM. This value is currently 4.
      INTEGER MWKIDS
      PARAMETER ( MWKIDS = 4 )

*   The contents of the common block are as follows
*     cbzone      i()    SGS base zone identifiers
*     cgonam      c()    Graphics name used to open device.
