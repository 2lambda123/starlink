      SUBROUTINE AGS_DEASS ( PARAM, PARCAN, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGS_DEASS
*
*  Purpose:
*     Deassociate a device from AGI and SGS.
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGS_DEASS( PARAM, PARCAN, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     This is a wrap-up routine to deassociate a device from the AGI
*     database and to close down SGS. The picture current when AGS_ASSOC
*     was called is reinstated. This routine call AGS_DEACT, AGI_END and
*     either AGI_CANCL or AGI_ANNUL. This routine is executed regardless
*     of the given value of status.
*
*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter associated with the device.
*     PARCAN = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true the parameter given by PARAM is cancelled, otherwise
*        it is annulled.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*
*  Algorithm:
*     Record the input status and begin an error context.
*     Deactivate the SGS interface.
*     End the AGI context.
*     Annul any errors from the last two steps.
*     If PARCAN is true then
*        Cancel the AGI device parameter.
*     Else
*        Annul the current picture identifier.
*     Endif
*     Reinstate the input status.

*  Record the input status and set the internal status to OK.

      STATUS = SAI__OK

*  Start a new error context to prevent error reports if there is no
*  active workstation or no current picture.
      CALL ERR_MARK

*  Deactivate SGS and close the workstation.  If the workstation was
*  not activated an error results.
      CALL AGS_DEACT( STATUS )

*  Close the AGI context and reinstate the input current picture.  If
*  there is no current picture an error results.
      CALL AGI_END( -1, STATUS )

*  We do not want either error message, but want to retain the
*  original error status, if there is one.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) CALL ERR_ANNUL( STATUS )

*  Release the new error context.
      CALL ERR_RLSE

*  Close the AGI database.  Record the name of the workstation only
*  if it was used successfully.
      IF ( PARCAN ) THEN
         CALL AGI_CANCL( PARAM, STATUS )

*  Inquire the input picture identifier so that it may be annulled
*  and the database closed.
