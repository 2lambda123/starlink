      SUBROUTINE AGI_ISAMP ( PICID, LSAME, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_ISAMP
*
*  Purpose:
*     Inquire if two pictures are the same
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_ISAMP( PICID, LSAME, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     Inquire if a picture identifier references the same picture as
*     the current picture. The picture referenced by the given picture
*     identifier is compared with the current picture to see if they
*     point to the same picture in the database.
*
*  Arguments:
*     PICID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Picture identifier.
*     LSAME = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if the pictures are the same, otherwise false.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*
*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     Get the workstation name and picture number of the current picture.
*     Get the workstation name and picture number of the given picture.
*     Compare the names and numbers.
