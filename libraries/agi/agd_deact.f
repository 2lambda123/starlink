      SUBROUTINE AGD_DEACT ( STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGD_DEACT
*
*  Purpose:
*     Close down IDI
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGD_DEACT( STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     Close down IDI whatever the value of status. This should be called
*     after all AGD and IDI routines.
*
*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
*
*  Algorithm:
*     Make sure the database contains the latest zoom and scroll factors.
*     Close all the devices that have been opened by AGD.
*     Clear the IDI active flag.
*     Clear the IDI-related common blocks.
