      SUBROUTINE AGI_1INIT

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_1INIT

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise the dynamic cache.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1INIT

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Initialise the dynamic cache.

*  Algorithm:
*     For every record in the cache
*        Indicate the element of the FIFO array to be empty = -1.
*        Make the forward and inverse transformation numbers = 0.
*     Enddo
*     Initialise the FIFO pointer to be FIFLEN - 1.

*   Initialise the number of pictures and the workstation flag
      CNUMPS = 0
      CNUMPW = ' '

*   Initialise the header control block
      CHEAD = -1

*   Initialise each fifo in turn
      DO J = 0, NFIFO - 1

*   Initialise the FIFO array to -1
         DO I = 0, FIFLEN - 1
            FIFO( I, J ) = -1

*   Make sure that the transformation numbers are zero
            CTRFOR( I, J ) = 0
            CTRINV( I, J ) = 0

         ENDDO

*   Initialise the pointer to FIFLEN - 1,
*   so it gets changed to 0 on first pass
         PFIFO( J ) = FIFLEN - 1

      ENDDO

      END
