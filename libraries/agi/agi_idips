*   MXMEMS specifies the maximum number of memories on a device
      INTEGER MXMEMS
      PARAMETER ( MXMEMS = 4 )

*   The contents of the common block are
*        cdipid    i    display identifier of device being stored
*        cnmems    i    actual number of memories on the device
*        czoomf    i()  zoom factors of the memories
*        cxscrl    i()  x-scroll factors of the memories
*        cyscrl    i()  y-scroll factors of the memories
*        cidion    l    flag to indicate IDI has been started
*        cgkson    l    flag to indicate GKS has been started
*        cpgpon    l    flag to indicate PGPLOT has been started

*   The display identifier of the device being stored
      INTEGER CDIPID

*   Actual number of memories on the device
      INTEGER CNMEMS

*   Zoom factors of the memories
      INTEGER CZOOMF( 0 : MXMEMS - 1 )

*   X-scroll factors of the memories
      INTEGER CXSCRL( 0 : MXMEMS - 1 )

*   Y-scroll factors of the memories
      INTEGER CYSCRL( 0 : MXMEMS - 1 )

*   Flag to indicate IDI has been started
      LOGICAL CIDION

*   Flag to indicate GKS has been started
      LOGICAL CGKSON

*   Flag to indicate PGPLOT has been started
      LOGICAL CPGPON
