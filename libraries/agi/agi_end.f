      SUBROUTINE AGI_END ( PICID, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_END
*
*  Purpose:
*     Mark the end of an AGI scope.
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_END( PICID, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     Mark the end of an AGI scope. The given picture is made the
*     current one. If the argument is a negative number then the picture
*     current when the matching AGI_BEGIN was called is made current.
*     All identifiers allocated within this begin-end block are annulled.
*     If the last active identifier is annulled the database is closed.
*
*  Arguments:
*     PICID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Picture identifier
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
*
*  Algorithm:
*     Initialise control variables.
*     Ensure the database locator is annuled.
*     Close the database if the flag is set
