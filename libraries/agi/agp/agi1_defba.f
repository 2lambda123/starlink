      SUBROUTINE AGI_1DEFBA ( WKNAME, AGINAM, DEVICE, NDC, WORLD,
     :                        STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_1DEFBA
*
*  Purpose:
*     Define the coordinates of the base picture (Native PGPLOT)
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1DEFBA( WKNAME, AGINAM, DEVICE, NDC, WORLD, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     This defines the coordinate system of the base picture for the
*     given workstation. The coordinate system is calculated to be the
*     same as that used by GKS to enable interoperability of AGI database 
*     entries. The PGPLOT view surface is defined to be represented by NDC 
*     coodinates of (0,1.,0,1.) even on rectangular devices while GKS
*     always maintains a square aspect ratio until explicitly altered.
*
*     GKS compatible representations of the device, normalised device and 
*     world coordinates of the base picture are returned.

*  Arguments:
*     WKNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Workstation name
*     AGINAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given but not used)
*        AGI name
*     DEVICE = REAL ( 4 ) (Returned)
*        Device coordinates of base picture
*     NDC = REAL ( 4 ) (Returned)
*        Normalised device coordinates of base picture
*     WORLD = REAL ( 4 ) (Returned)
*        World coordinates of base picture
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
