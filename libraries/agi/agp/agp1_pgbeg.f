      SUBROUTINE AGP1_PGBEG( PARAM, WKNAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     AGP1_PGBEG
*
*  Purpose:
*     Ensure PGPLOT is open for plotting on the specified device.
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGP1_PGBEG( PARAM, WKNAME, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     This routine does nothing if PGPLOT is already active.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter name associated with the graphics device. May be
*        blank. Only used for error messages.
*     WKNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Workstation name
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
