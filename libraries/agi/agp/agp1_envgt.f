*+
*  Name:
*     AGP1_ENVGT

*  Purpose:
*     Attempt to translate an environment variable.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGP1_ENVGT( NAME, TRANS, OK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine attempts to find the value of an environment variable
*     with the supplied name. If no such environment variable exists,
*     OK is returned .FALSE., but no error is reported.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The environment variable name.
*     TRANS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The value of the enviroment variable.
*     OK = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        .TRUE. if the environment variables exists, .FALSE. otherwise.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
