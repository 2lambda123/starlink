      SUBROUTINE AGI_1OWORK ( WKNAME, WKSLOC, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_1OWORK

*  Purpose:
*     Open workstation structure.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_1OWORK ( WKNAME, WKSLOC, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Open a workstation structure

*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     Find out if the workstation is already open.
*     If it is not then
*        Create a new workstation structure and get a locator to it.
*     Endif
