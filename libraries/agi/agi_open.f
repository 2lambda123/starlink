      SUBROUTINE AGI_OPEN ( WKNAME, ACMODE, PICID, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_OPEN
*
*  Purpose:
*     Open an AGI device in a non-ADAM environment
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_OPEN( WKNAME, ACMODE, PICID, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     Open an AGI device and return an identifier to the current picture.
*     If there are no pictures on the device then a base picture is
*     created and made current. If the size of the display window has
*     changed since a previous database operation the database is cleared
*     and a message sent to the user. The access mode does not affect the
*     database operation, but it is used by the graphics system to
*     determine if the display should be cleared the first time a zone is
*     created; 'READ' and 'UPDATE' access do not clear the display, but
*     'WRITE' access does.
*
*  Arguments:
*     WKNAME = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Name of the device to open
*     ACMODE = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Access mode: 'READ', 'WRITE' or 'UPDATE'
*     PICID = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifier for current picture on the given device
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
*
*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     If this is the first time this routine has run then
*        Initialise the common blocks and graphics package flags.
*     Endif
*     Get an AGI name for the given workstation name.
*     Get a picture identifier.
*     Open the database and the workstation structure.
*     If there is a current picture in the database then
*        Get its picture number.
*     Else
*        Define the base picture for this workstation.
*        Store the base picture in the database.
*     Endif
*     Put the details of the picture in the common block.
