*+
*  Name:
*     AGI_ISAMD
*
*  Purpose:
*     Inquire if pictures are on same device
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL AGI_ISAMD( PICID, LSAME, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     Inquire if the given picture is on the same device as the current
*     picture.
*
*  Arguments:
*     PICID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Picture identifier
*     LSAME = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if pictures on same device, otherwise false.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
*
*  Algorithm:
*     Check status on entry.
*     Get the workstation name of the current picture.
*     Get the workstation name of the given picture.
*     Compare the names.
