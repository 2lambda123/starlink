      SUBROUTINE sgs_1GETZ (IWKID, IZONID)
*+
*  Name:
*     GETZ

*  Purpose:
*     Allocate a zone table entry.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type Of Module:
*     Internal routine

*  Description:
*     A negative IWKID is specified when the base zone for a workstation
*     is being created.
*
*     IZONID = 0 indicates either that the workstation ID is illegal
*     (i.e. zero) or that all zone table entries are in use.

*  Arguments:
*     IWKID = INTEGER (Given)
*         Workstation ID or its complement
*     IZONID = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Zone ID  (0=failure)

*  Preset zone ID to failure
