      SUBROUTINE sgs_ISTAT (MODE, JSTAT)
*+
*  Name:
*     ISTAT

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise SGS status mode.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     In inherited status mode SGS routines with a status argument only
*     execute if the status is set to zero on entry; in non-inherited
*     mode the status is ignored and the routines always execute.

*  Arguments:
*     MODE = INTEGER (Given)
*         Status Mode:
*            0  = non-inherited
*            >0 = inherited
*            <0 = set to default (non-inherited) if not
*                 already set
*     JSTAT = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*         Status in inherited status mode.
*         Returns zero in non-inherited status mode.
