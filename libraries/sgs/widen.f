      SUBROUTINE sgs_WIDEN (CIDENT,WS,CONID,JSTAT)
*+
*  Name:
*     WIDEN

*  Purpose:
*     Convert a character string workstation description to an integer
*     workstation sequence number and connection identifier by calling
*     the GNS library.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Arguments:
*     CIDENT = CHAR (Given)
*         The character workstation identifier
*     WS = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Workstation sequence number (if JSTAT=0)
*     CONID = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Connection ID (if JSTAT=0)
*     JSTAT = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Status  = 0 if success
