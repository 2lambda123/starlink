*+
*  Name:
*     MARKL

*  Purpose:
*     Draw marker at current end of polyline.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     The marker type is set to MARKL. The marker type ASF is assumed to
*     be set to GINDIV.
*
*     If no polyline has yet been begun no marker is drawn.

*  Arguments:
