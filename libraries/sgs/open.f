      SUBROUTINE sgs_OPEN (WKSTN, IZONID, JSTAT)
*+
*  Name:
*     OPEN

*  Purpose:
*     Open SGS with logical unit 6 for errors, and one workstation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     When the "Starlink" GKS error handler is being used, all errors are
*     sent to the Starlink error reporting system, and the error channel
*     passed to GOPKS is never used - except that the channel may be
*     opened which causes an empty file to be created on some systems.
*     This can be avoided by using a channel which is pre-connected to the
*     terminal (usually 6).  This may not be appropriate on all systems.

*  Arguments:
*     WKSTN = CHAR (Given)
*         Workstation name
*     IZONID = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Zone identifier
*     JSTAT = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Status: 0=OK
