      SUBROUTINE sgs_TXR (X,Y, R, NFI, NDP)
*+
*  Name:
*     TXR

*  Purpose:
*     Begin a new text string with a formatted real number.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     (In practice, this means simply "plot a formatted real number")

*  Arguments:
*     X = REAL (Given)
*         Position of text string (x)
*     Y = REAL (Given)
*         "    "   "      "   (y)
*     R = REAL (Given)
*         Real number to be formatted
*     NFI = INTEGER (Given)
*         Format indicator:-
*         either  number of leading spaces (NFI.GE.0)
*         or  minus the field width (NFI.LT.0)
*     NDP = INTEGER (Given)
*         Number of decimal places
*         If NDP.LT.0, only the integer part appears
*         If NDP.EQ.0, the decimal point appears
*         If NDP.GT.0, NDP digits appear after the point

*  Notes:
*     The field width is limited in size - see sgs_ATXR coding.

      REAL X,Y,R
      INTEGER NFI,NDP



*  Begin the new text string
