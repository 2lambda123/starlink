  <description>SGS -- Simple Graphics System</description>
  <abstract><p> SGS is a set of subroutines for performing low-level
  graphics input/output.  SGS is implemented above the GKS package
  (described in SUN/83, the RAL GKS Guide and the ISO document GKS
  7.4) which is a device independent graphics system designed to be
  the kernel of a wide variety of graphics systems.  GKS, which is
  very comprehensive, does not itself set out to provide the most
  convenient interfaces for all applications, and SGS allows easy
  access to many of its more straightforward features.</p> <p> SGS,
  while preserving GKS concepts and indeed allowing direct GKS calls
  to be interspersed with SGS calls, is optimised for convenience in
  simple cases.  Many of its features are low level (for example:
  open, draw a line, draw a text string, close), but there are some
  routines of a slightly higher level (drawing arcs and formatted
  numbers etc).  SGS does not include routines for high level
  operations like drawing annotated axes or complete graphs.
