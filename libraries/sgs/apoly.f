      SUBROUTINE sgs_APOLY (X,Y)
*+
*  Name:
*     APOLY

*  Purpose:
*     Append new point to current polyline.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     If the polyline buffer is full, call OPOLY to flush the polyline to
*     GKS and start a new polyline beginning at the last point of the old
*     one.  Copy the new point into the buffer and increment the number of
*     points.

*  Arguments:
*     X = REAL (Given)
*         X coordinate of new point
*     Y = REAL (Given)
*         Y     "      "   "    "
