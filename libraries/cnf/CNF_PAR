*  Name:
*     CNF_PAR

*  Purpose:
*     Define public global constants for the CNF_ system.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Platform-specific global constants include file.
*     Although this is in principle platform-specific, it appears that
*     all the platform-specific code is identical.  That variation
*     was therefore discarded on import to CVS/autoconfing -- it is
*     better done through configuration switches in any case
*     (NG, 12-Dec-2003)

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of global constants which are used
*     by the CNF_ system and which may also be needed by software which
*     calls routines from this system.
