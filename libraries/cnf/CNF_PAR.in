*  Name:
*     CNF_PAR

*  Purpose:
*     Define public global constants for the CNF_ system.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Platform-specific global constants include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of global constants which are used
*     by the CNF_ system and which may also be needed by software which
*     calls routines from this system.
*
*     It is dynamically generated such that CNF_PVAL returns the declared
*     size of the return value from CNF_PVAL is large enough to hold
*     a C pointer.
