FIO Version 1.5-3 is released.

This version corrects problems arising from the use of a single BLOCK_DATA
segment with two different shared libraries.

FIO Version 1.5-2 is released.

The value of the public parameter FIO__SZFNM is increased from 80 to
200.

The Linux version has been brought in line with other platforms to return
status FIO__FILNF rather than the obsolete FIO__NOTFD if it cannot find a
file which is supposed to exist.

Other minor changes are made to improve the consistency of behaviour
on different platforms under error conditions. A note on the effect of EOF
terminated records has been added to the descriptions of FIO_READ and
FIO_READF in SUN/143.

The makefile has been brought up to date - amongst other things, shared
libraries will now be produced on Linux.

The format of SUN/143 has been updated and early `Changes' sections have been
removed but there is no change in other sections.
