      SUBROUTINE FIO_UNIT( FD, UNIT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FIO_UNIT

*  Purpose:
*     Get a unit number given a file descriptor

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FIO_UNIT( FD, UNIT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The Fortran unit number associated with the given file descriptor
*     is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The file descriptor.
*     UNIT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Variable to receive the unit number.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     The file descriptor is checked for validity then, if OK
*     the unit number is obtained from the descriptor tables.
