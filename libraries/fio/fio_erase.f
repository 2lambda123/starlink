      SUBROUTINE FIO_ERASE( FILE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FIO_ERASE

*  Purpose:
*     Delete a file

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FIO_ERASE( FILE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Delete the named file.

*  Arguments:
*     FILE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Expression giving the name of the file to be deleted.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     Get a Fortran unit number and attempt to delete the file using
*     the Fortran 77 OPEN and CLOSE statements.

*  History:
*     30-Jul-1980 (SLW):
*        Original.
*     10-May-1983 (SLW):
*        Tidy up for Starlink version.
*     13-Oct-1986 (AJC):
*        Remove DISP from OPEN and replace DISP in CLOSE with STATUS
*        i.e. F77 standards.
*     16-Feb-1988 (AJC):
*        Rationalize include files.
*     25-Feb-1988 (AJC):
*        Improve prologue.
*     29-OCT-1991 (PMA):
*        Changed references to FIO_$xxxxx to FIO1_xxxxx.
*        Removed include of FIOFIL_CMN as none of the variables in the
*        common block are referenced by this routine.
*     28-JAN-1992 (PMA):
*        Change RETURN statement to GOTO end of code.
*     9-MAR-1992 (PMA):
*        Change thevariable VMSERR to SYSERR
*     12-MAR-1992 (PMA):
*        Change the call to FIO1_SERR to FIO_SERR.
*     17-MAR-1992 (PMA):
*        Add missing IMPLICIT NONE statement
*     3-APR-1992 (PMA):
*        Change the name of include files to lower case.
*     24-AUG-1992 (PMA):
*        Fix layout of brackets.
*     18-FEB-1993 (PMA):
*        Change the name of include files to upper case.
