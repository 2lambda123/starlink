#  Documentation is uncomplicated
STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION(sun143)

#   Declare options for platform-specific sources.
#   The original set of extensions was [alpha_OSF1 ix86_Linux mips
#   sun4 sun4_Solaris vms], which has migrated to [_dec_osf
#   _pc_linux _sun_solaris _sun mips vax].  The `vax' option is
#   actually the old VMS option -- which is redundant in some sense,
#   since VMS not a Unix (gosh): perhaps this would be better as __ultrix.
#
#   Note that fio1_open.f was originally handled this way, but has
#   been replaced by fio1_open.fpp, and fio1_open.f{_dec_osf,
#   _pc_linux, _sun, _sun_solaris, default, and mips} have been
#   deleted.  fio1_open.fvax has been retained, but this is largely
#   for historical interest.  Exactly the same for rio1_open.f ->
#   rio1_open.fpp and rio1_open.fvax.
#
#   fio1_serr.f has significant platform dependencies, and
#   can't be easily handled through this sort of configuration.

                      [_dec_osf _pc_linux _sun_solaris _sun mips vax _apple_darwin _pc_cygwin _linux_gnu _pc_solaris])
#   The sun options require a sun_iosdef file, but if neither of these
#   two matches, that's OK -- presumably we're not on a Sun.

#   Header checks.  There are no such explicit checks at present,

#   included by anything.  However we might as well include this
#   stanza here, to support that in future, but also to keep down
#   the length of generated command lines.
