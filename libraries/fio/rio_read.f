      SUBROUTINE RIO_READ( FD, RECNO, NCHAR, BUF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     RIO_READ

*  Purpose:
*     Read record from direct access file

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RIO_READ( FD, RECNO, NCHAR, BUF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Read the specified unformatted record from the file with the
*     given file descriptor.

*  Arguments:
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The file descriptor.
*     RECNO = INTEGER (Given)
*        Expression giving the number of the record to be read.
*     NCHAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        Expression giving the buffer size
*     BUF = BYTE( NCHAR ) (Returned)
*        A byte array to receive the record.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Check for a valid file descriptor and that the file is open.
*     -  Read a record from the file using a READ statement.
*     -  If there are any errors in reading the file, call FIO_SERR to
*        report the error.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Uses the non-standard BYTE variable type.

*  History:
*     06-Aug-1980: Original. (SLW)
*     10-May-1983: Tidy up for Starlink version. (SLW)
*     17-Feb-1988: Rationalize include files  (AJC)
*     25-Feb-1988: Improve prologue
*        and correct use of NCHAR  (AJC)
*     01-Nov-1991: Change to new style prologue (KFH)
*        Insert IMPLICIT NONE (KFH)
*        Change variable vmserr to ioerr (KFH)
*        Change fac_$name to fac1_name (KFH)
*        Replace tabs with spaces in end-of-line comments (KFH)
*     26-FEB-1992 (PMA):
*        Tidy up prologue.
*        The statement   CALL FIO1_CHKFD( FD, RFD, STATUS )
*        was commented out. Remove the comment character.
*     17-MAR-1992 (PMA):
*        Remove the assignment to RFD and the check of its value as this
*        is done by the call to FIO1_CHKFD.
*     3-APR-1992 (PMA):
*        Change the name of include files to lower case.
*     24-AUG-1992 (PMA):
*        Change the layout of brackets.
*     18-FEB-1993 (PMA):
*        Change the name of include files to upper case.
*     29-NOV-1994 (AJC):
*        Add END= clause as Solaris gives that if RECNO beyond end of file
*      5-DEC-1996 (AJC):
*        Remove both END and ERR clause as all systems behave differently
