      SUBROUTINE RIO_CLOSE( FD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     RIO_CLOSE

*  Purpose:
*     Close a direct access file

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RIO_CLOSE( FD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Close the file with the specified file descriptor.

*  Arguments:
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        A variable containing the file descriptor.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     If the STATUS variable is not SAI__OK on input, then the routine
*     will still attempt to execute, but will return with STATUS set to
*     the import value.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check that the file descriptor is valid, and that the file is
*     open.
*     Flush any buffers yet to be written to the file, and then close
*     it.
*     Release the relevant table entries.
