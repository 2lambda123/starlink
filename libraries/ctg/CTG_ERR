*  Name:
*     CTG_ERR

*  Purpose:
*     Define global constants used to define CTG_ error conditions.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global constants include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of global constants used to define
*     error conditions generated within the CTG_ system. CTG routines
*     can also return error values generated by any of the packages
*     called within CTG.
