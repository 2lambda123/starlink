# We are building libgks.la from convenience libraries.  However, all
# the libraries contain Fortran source, and so must be assembled into
# a library using the F77 or FC languages, rather than the C linker
# (this matters on OSX, since the OSX linker has a big downer on
# common blocks, and needs the Fortran voodoo to make it happy).  In
# order to make this happen, we list a dummy Fortran file as a
# source.  This is enough to tell automake to use Fortran in the link.
