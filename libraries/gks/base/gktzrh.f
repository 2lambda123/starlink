*
*  ALGORITHM
*  ---------
*     This routine assumes that the edge table structure supplied
*     does correspond to a polygon.
*     The edges are assumed to be sorted in the order of the Y-values
*     of their tops, downwards and edges of equal Y-value by the vertex
*     index of their tops.
*
*     The edge table does not explicitly include all horizontal edges.
*     Those derived from chopping of peak (refered to as peak edges)
*     are indicated by the presence of two edges with the same vertex
*     Y-index for their tops. To find such a pair easy to find the
*     edge table is sorted to ensure so that they are consecutive.
*
*     For edges from the start of the edge table in the edge table
*     ordering, until one is reached, whose top is lower than the first,
*        Find a peak and remove all horizontal edges leading from it.
*
*     Count number of peaks found and number of edges removed.
*     Report error if no peaks were found and return number of edges
*     removed.
