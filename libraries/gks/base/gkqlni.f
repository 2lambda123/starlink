*  PURPOSE OF THE ROUTINE
*  ----------------------
*     Determine whether two line segments intersect and if so
*     give the intersection point.
*
*  MAINTENANCE LOG
*  ---------------
*     20/04/89  KEVP  Eliminated false positive in event of 1st line
*                     being of negligible length.
*     25/04/89  KEVP  Removed debug WRITE statements.
*     22/07/90  PLP   Commenting brought in line with standard format.
*     29/10/91  KEVP  Improved precision (C69).
*
*  ARGUMENTS
*  ---------
*     INP  XL1,YL1  The end points of the first line segment
*     INP  XL2,YL2  The end points of the second line segment
*     OUT  CROSS    True, if the lines intersect
*     OUT  COLLIN   True, if CROSS and lines are collinear
*     OUT  XC,YC    The intersection point, if CROSS is true
*                      If the lines are colinear, both end pts of
*                      the intersection are given.
