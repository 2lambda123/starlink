These are the standard RAL GKS files with three exceptions:

gkcell.f has a bona fide bug fix

gkesc.f returns an error code 180 for escapes other than -1 and -2

gkvers.f disables printing on the GKS version to stdout on initialisation.
         This is simply commented out. We could enable this via a preprocessor
         directive if it needs to be resurrected.

gprec.f  Fix include of check.inc to use ../include

gesc.f   Add escape -3

It is the combined files from both the original 'sources' (the 
gk* files) directory and the 'fortran' directory.

All files compile to libgks_base.la for later inclusion into the
normal libgks library by the parent directory.

Note that in the original RAL GKS distribution optimization for gkclip.f
was disabled on sun3 and sun4 platforms.
