These are the standard RAL GKS include files with the exception
that the explicit CPP processing that used switching on operating
systems has been tidied up for inclusion in autoconf system.


check.inc

  Since modern fortran compilers understand 'IMPLICIT NONE'
  this include file now simply includes that one statement.

gkmc.par

  This is now processed by the configure system which then generates
  a files suitable for CPP processing (.fpp).

  The configure processing generates the version string.

  Fortran CPP processor inserts the units of RECL. (KRCBYT)

  KMNIO was always 0 and so is now simply 0

  QTOL was 1.0E-7 for all cases except vax. Simply set it to 1.0E-7

  Calculation of KMXIO is now set at 40 until a configure test
  can be created.

gkwca.cmn

  String size set to 512 for all. RS6000 used 500. Cray used 152.

gkpid.par

  All systems were identical except for Cray.
  Since we are not running autoconf on Cray, simply ignore the difference
  for now.
