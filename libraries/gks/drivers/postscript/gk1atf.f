*
*  Type of routine:  (Part of) workstation driver
*
      INCLUDE '../../include/check.inc'
*
*  PURPOSE OF THE ROUTINE
*  ----------------------
*     Send a series of trapezoids (parallel sides horizontal) into
*     the current path,(for Fill Areas that have been subjected to
*     trapezoid decomposition).
*
*  MAINTENANCE LOG
*  ---------------
*     Maintenance log is incorporated in main driver
*
*  ARGUMENTS
*  ---------
*     INP NT      - The Actual Number of Trapezoids
*     INP NAT     - Number of Trapezoids that can be put into the arrays
*     INP TZA     - Array trapedoid specifications
*
*     The array TZA contains the specification of NT trapezoids in
*     sequentially each of form:
*
*        (Upper-Left X, Lower-Left X, Upper-Right X, Lower-Right X,
*         Upper Y, Lower Y).

*
*  ALGORITHM
*  ---------
*     A path is formed out trapezoids. Each trapezoid is a subpath
*     formed by the 'tz' procedure. The path is preceded by a
*     'gsave' and followed by the appropiate fill area
*     prodecure 'fasoldo' 'fapi' etc  and  'grestore'.
*
*     The coordinates specifying the each trapeziod are put into the
*     current path, using the 'tz' operater that allows each trapezoid
*     to be specified by 6 real numbers, rather than 8, since the
*     Y-coordinates are the same for both the left and right hand
*     sides of the trapezoid.
*     The format of the coordinates is chosen to save file space.
*
*  NOTE
*  ----
*     This routing does not call 'save' or 'restore' one of the
*     routines calling this one should do it.
