/*
 * RAL GKS SYSTEM
 *
 * gk9scm_: Colour manager for the Sun workstation using WW.
 *
 * Type of Routine:  Part of WORKSTATION DRIVER
 * Author:           TAW
 *
 * Copyright (C) SERC 1987
 *
 * Maintenance Log:
 *
 *  31/03/87  TAW   Created.
 *  22/03/87  PJWR  Redocumented and extended.
 *  14/07/87  PJWR  IS: Changed error 2006 to error -2006.
 *  08/09/87  PJWR  Corrected description of parameter 'range'.
 *  15/09/87  PJWR  Modified handling of monochrome workstations to
 *                  reflect changes to the underlying software.
 *  22/09/87  PJWR  Changed from editing single entries to getting old
 *                  colourmap,  editing and reloading.  Parameter 'range'
 *                  no longer needed - size of colour table is read from
 *                  workstation description table.  Tweaking of SunView
 *                  foreground colour to prevent resetting by SunView
 *                  added and yet more changes to monochrome handling.
 *  08/12/87  PJWR  Changed colour mapping so GKS uses SunView conventions.
