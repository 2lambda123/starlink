/*
 * RAL GKS SYSTEM
 *
 * gk9ssf_: Selects an appropriate raster font for STRING and CHAR precision
 *          text,  given the character height.
 *
 * Type of Function:  Part of WORKSTATION DRIVER
 * Author:            TAW
 *
 * Copyright (C) SERC 1987
 *
 * Maintenance Log:
 *
 *  ??/??/87  TAW   Original version stabilised.
 *  10/09/87  PJWR  Rewritten to keep all the variable font information in
 *                  one place.  Main driver no longer needs to know anything
 *                  about font geometry.
 *  21/10/87  PJWR  Modified returned height so that it gives a pixel centre
 *                  to pixel centre measurement in DC rather than the height
 *                  in raster units.
 *  16/12/87  PJWR  Switched to cour.r fonts for RAL GKS 1.10 and added notes
 *                  on necessary WDT updates.

 *
 * Comments:
 *
 *  The constant ICHSIZ above is dependant on the PARAMETER of the same name
 *  in GK9SWD(),  and should have a value one less than the PARAMETER.
 *
 *  The font geometry information is copied into QWKDAT,  and the index of the
 *  font in 'fonts' is stored in KWKDAT.
 *
 *  If the font style used is changed,  you must update the WDT files for the
 *  Sun workstation types.  The values that need changing are kchh, qmnchh and
 *  qmxchh in the WDT section (the number of fonts as given by NFONT and the
 *  minimum and maximum height of the font family as given in FONT_TABLE).
 *
 *  The quantities held in a Font_info structure relate to a Sun raster
 *  character as follows (a 'M' is used as an example):
 *
 *			. . . . . . .> cap_to_top (1)
 *		       <X . . . . X .
 *		       <X . . . . X .
 *		       <X X . . X X .
 *		       <X X . . X X .
 *	    height (9) <X . X X . X .
 *		       <X . X X . X .
 *		       <X . . . . X .
 *		       <X . . . . X .<---- SunView baseline
 *		       <X . . . . X .<---- GKS baseline
 *			. . . . . . .> 
 *			. . . . . . .> base_to_bottom (3)
 *			. . . . . . .>
 *			V V V V V V V
 *                        width (7)
 *
 *  baseline_offset is set by inspection.  If the GKS baseline (the lowest
 *  pixel set on a letter with no descenders) is one pixel below the SunView
 *  baseline (as shown by fontedit) then baseline_offset = -1,  and so forth.
 *
 *  Note that base_to_bottom is the number of pixels from below the GKS
 *  baseline to the lowest set pixel in a raster, NOT the bottom of the raster.
