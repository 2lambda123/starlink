 *  Name:
 *    datExportFloc

 *  Purpose:
 *    Export from a C HDS Locator to a Fortran HDS locator

 *  Language:
 *    Starlink ANSI C

 *  Invocation:
 *    datExportFloc( HDSLoc** clocator, int free, int len, char flocator[DAT__SZLOC], int * status );

 *  Description:
 *    This function should be used to populate a Fortran HDS locator buffer
 *    (usually a Fortran CHARACTER string of size DAT__SZLOC) from a C HDS
 *    locator structure. This function is also available in the
 *    HDS_EXPORT_CLOCATOR macro defined in hds_fortran.h.

 *  Arguments:
 *    HDSLoc ** clocator = Given & Returned
 *       Pointer to Locator to be exported. If the memory is freed, the
 *       locator will be set to NULL on return, else it will be untouched.
 *    int free = Given
 *       If true (1) the C locator is freed once the
 *       Fortran locator is populated. If false, the locator memory is not
 *       touched.
 *    int len = Given
 *       Size of Fortran character buffer to recieve the locator. Sanity check.
 *    char flocator[DAT__SZLOC] = Returned
 *       Fortran character string buffer. Should be at least DAT__SZLOC
 *       characters long. If clocator is NULL, fills the buffer
 *       with DAT__NOLOC.
 *    int * status = Given & Returned
 *       Inherited status. If status is bad the Fortran locator will be
 *       filled with DAT__NOLOC. The memory associated with clocator will
 *       be freed if free is true regardless of status.

 *  Authors:
 *    TIMJ: Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)

 *  History:
 *    16-NOV-2005 (TIMJ):
 *      Initial version
 *    18-NOV-2005 (TIMJ):
 *      Make semi public to allow other Fortran wrappers to use this function.
 *      Rename from dat1_export_floc to datExportFloc

 *  Notes:
 *    - Fortran locator string must be preallocted. The C locator can be freed
 *    at the discretion of the caller. This simplifies code in the Fortran
 *    interface wrapper.
 *    - This routine is intended to be used solely for
 *    wrapping Fortran layers from C. "Export" means to export a native
 *    C locator to Fortran.
 *    - There is no Fortran eqiuvalent to this routine.
