NDF Library
-----------
   A new release (V1.5-6) of the NDF library is now available.

   - A bug has been fixed in the C interface for function ndfChunk.

   - Facilities for handling foreign extension specifiers (such as 
     FITS image extensions) within the "on-the-fly" data conversion 
     scheme have been added. SSN/20 has been updated to include these
     changes.
