NDF Library
-----------

V2.1

- A new tuning parameter called ROUND has been added that controls how
floating-point values are converted to integer during automatic type
conversion.

- The behaviour of ndfUnlock has changed. Previously, calling ndfUnlock
would automatically annull all other identifiers associated with the same
base NDF. This no longer happens. Such identifiers can now be used safely
once the original thread has regained the lock on the base NDF.
