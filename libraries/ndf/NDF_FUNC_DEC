*  Name:
*     NDF_FUNC_DEC

*  Purpose:
*     Declare statement functions and their arguments for the NDF_
*     system.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Function declaration include file.

*  Description:
*     This include file declares statement functions and their
*     arguments which are used internally by the NDF_ system and which
*     may also be used by other software which calls NDF_ routines.

*  Notes:
*     -  This file exists to encapsulate functions which require
*     non-portable Fortran and which may therefore need to be
*     implemented differently on different machines. It should be
*     followed by the include file NDF_DEF, which defines the functions
*     declared here.
