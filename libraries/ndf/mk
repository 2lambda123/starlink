#  Name:
#     mk
#
#  Version:
#     Version for Mk V library makefile.
#
#  Purpose:
#     Invoke make to build and install the NDF package.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.
#
#  Description:
#     This script should normally be used to invoke the make utility
#     to build and install the NDF package and to perform other
#     housekeeping tasks.  It invokes the make utility after first
#     defining appropriate environment variables and macros for the
#     computer system in use.  This file also serves to document the
#     systems on which NDF is implemented.
#
#  Invocation:
#     The user of this script should normally first define the SYSTEM
#     environment variable to identify the host computer system (see
#     the "Supported Systems" section).  This script should then be used
#     in the same way as the make utility would be used.  For instance,
#     to build, install and test NDF, you might use the following
#     commands:
#
#        ./mk build
#        ./mk install
#        ./mk test
#        ./mk clean
#
#  Supported Systems:
#     The following systems are currently supported and may be
#     identified by defining the SYSTEM environment variable
#     appropriately before invoking this script:
#
#        alpha_OSF1
#           DEC Alpha machines running OSF1
#
#        ix86_Linux
#           Intel PC running Linux
#
#        sun4_Solaris
#           SUN Sparcstations running SunOS 5.x (Solaris)
#
#     In addition, the following systems have been supported at some
#     time in the past.  This script contains the macro definitions 
#     needed for these systems, but it is not known whether NDF
#     will still build or run on these systems:
#
#        mips
#           DECstations running Ultrix
#
#        sun4
#           SUN Sparcstations running SunOS 4.x
#
#     This script will exit without action if the SYSTEM environment
#     variable is not defined.  A warning will be issued if it is
#     defined but is not set to one of the values above.  In this case,
#     no additional environment variables will be defined by this
#     script (any that are pre-defined will be passed on to make
#     unaltered).
#
#  Targets:
#     For details of what targets are provided, see the associated
#     makefile.  The latter will normally provide a default target
#     called "help", which outputs a message describing this script
#     and lists the targets provided.
#
#  Notes on Porting:
#     If your machine or system setup does not appear in this script,
#     then it should be possible to build and install NDF by
#     adding a new case to this script with appropriate definitions
#     (probably based on one of the existing implementations).
#
#  make Macros:
#     The following "global" make macros are used in the associated
#     makefile and may be changed by means of appropriate environment
#     variable definitions (in each case the default is shown in
#     parentheses).  Note that these macros are provided to allow
#     external control over the directories in which software is
#     installed, etc., so they should not normally be re-defined within
#     this script.
#
#        STARLINK (/star)
#           Pathname of the root directory beneath which Starlink
#           software is currently installed.  This indicates to
#           NDF where to find other Starlink software (include
#           files, libraries, etc.) which it uses.
#
#        INSTALL ($HOME)
#           Pathname of the root directory beneath which NDF will
#           be installed for use.  Your home directory will be used by
#           default.  This macro is provided to allow NDF to be
#           installed locally for personal use (e.g. during development
#           or testing).  It should be set to the $STARLINK directory if
#           you want to add NDF into an already installed set of
#           Starlink software.  You should ensure that the appropriate
#           sub-directories appear on any relevant search paths which
#           your system uses for locating software (e.g. binaries and
#           libraries).
#
#        EXPORT (.)
#           Pathname of the directory into which compressed tar files
#           will be written if the "export" or "export_source" make
#           targets are used to produce an exportable copy of NDF
#           or its source files.  The current working directory (i.e.
#           the NDF source directory) will be used by default.
#
#     The following "local" make macros are used in the associated
#     makefile and should normally be overridden by environment variable
#     definitions within this script.  All the local macros that are
#     used in building a package should be overridden even when the value
#     is the same as the default.  This documents which macros are used
#     and ensures that the package will continue to build correctly even
#     if the default values are changed.  Macros that are not used on a
#     particular machine (e.g. BLD_SHR on DECstations) should not be
#     overridden.  In each case the default is shown in parentheses.
#
#        AR_IN (ar -r)
#           The command to use to insert an object (.o) file into an
#           archive (.a) library.  On some systems the variation 'ar r'
#           may be required instead.
#
#        BLD_SHR (:)
#           Command to build a shareable library when given three
#           arguments specifying (1) the name of the library file to be
#           built (2) a list of the object files to be used in the
#           library and (3) a list of any additional libraries against
#           which to link.  By default, it is assumed that shareable
#           libraries are not available, and the default acts as a null
#           command.
#
#        CC (c89)
#           The C compiler command to use. NDF requires an ANSI C
#           compiler, although other compilers may be acceptable so
#           long as they support function prototyping. Users of GNU C
#           should be aware that the ANSI versions of include files are
#           required, and that problems may be encountered with GNU C if
#           your C run-time library departs from ANSI behaviour.
#
#        CFLAGS (-O)
#           The C compiler options to use.
#
#        FC (fort77)
#           The Fortran compiler command to use.  NDF requires a Fortran
#           77 compiler that supports the common "permitted" Starlink
#           extensions, as documented in Starlink General Paper SGP/16.
#           (These include only the most common extensions, such as
#           long names, end of line comments, include files, etc.)
#
#        FFLAGS (-O)
#           The Fortran compiler options to be used.
#
#        LINK (ln)
#           The command required to establish a link to a file.  The
#           default assumes POSIX.2 behavior, which only provides a
#           "hard" link operating within a single file system.  If the
#           host operating system allows "symbolic" links, then this
#           macro might be re-defined as 'ln -s'.  Alternatively, if the
#           use of multiple file systems is essential but not supported
#           by any form of link, then a copy command could be
#           substituted (e.g. 'cp -p'), at some cost in file space.
#
#        RANLIB (:)
#           The command required to "randomise" an object library.  By
#           default, this operation is not performed (the default acts
#           as a null command).  On systems which require it, this
#           should typically be set to 'ranlib'.
#
#        SHARE (.so)
#           The file type suffix to be applied to produce the name of a
#           shareable library file.  By default, the ".so" suffix is
#           applied without a library version number.  For systems which
#           support version numbers on shareable libraries, the macro
#           LIB_VERS is defined within the associated makefile and may
#           be used as part of a definition such as '.so.$(LIB_VERS)'.
#
#        SOURCE_VARIANT ('')
#           The name used to distinguish between platform-specific
#           files (by appending it to file names). Using the default
#           ('') implies that there are no files that differ between
#           platforms. If this is not the case, set SOURCE_VARIANT to a
#           suitable string. For example setting it to '_$(SYSTEM)' would
#           allow files to be distinguished by the name of the system to
#           which they apply.
#
#        TAR_IN (pax -w -v -x ustar -f)
#           Command to use to insert a file into a .tar archive file.
#           The default uses the POSIX.2 pax command, which is not
#           available on traditional UNIX systems.  These typically use
#           a tar command such as 'tar -cvhf' instead (if symbolic
#           links are supported, then an option to follow these must be
#           included in this command).
#
#        TAR_OUT (pax -r -f)
#           Command to use to extract a file from a .tar archive file.
#           The default uses the POSIX.2 pax command, which is not
#           available on traditional UNIX systems.  These typically use
#           a tar command such as 'tar -xf' instead.
#
#  Implementation Deficiencies:
#     -  The implementation of shareable libraries on the alpha_OSF1
#        system is still preliminary.
