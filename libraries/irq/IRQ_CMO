*  Name:
*     IRQ_CMO

*  Purpose:
*     Declares the variables and common blocks used to hold information
*     about the logical operators supported by IRQ.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     The variables which are used to store information defining the 
*     properties of the logical operators which can be used within
*     IRQ quality expressions are declared, together with the common 
*     blocks /IRQ_COI/ and /IRQ_COC/ which are used to store them.
*
*     Modules IRQ_PAO and IRQ_PAR must be included before this module.

*  Declare integer variables:
      INTEGER OPC_DSTK( IRQ__MXINS )! Change in size of evaluation stack
                                   ! as a result of each symbol.
      INTEGER OPC_L( IRQ__MXINS )  ! No. of used characters in SYM.
      INTEGER OPC_OPL( IRQ__MXINS )! If set to one, then an operand is
                                   ! needed to the left of the symbol.
      INTEGER OPC_OPR( IRQ__MXINS )! If set to one, then an operand is
                                   ! needed to the right of the symbol.
      INTEGER OPC_OPS( IRQ__MXINS )! The number of operands required by
                                   ! the symbol.
      INTEGER OPC_PRL( IRQ__MXINS )! Precedence (seen from the left).
      INTEGER OPC_PRR( IRQ__MXINS )! Precedence (seen from the right).
      INTEGER OPC_WRT( IRQ__MXINS )! Set to one if the symbol writes a 
                                   ! value to the FILO evaluation stack.

*  Delare common block:
      COMMON /IRQ_COI/ OPC_L, OPC_OPL, OPC_OPR, OPC_PRL, OPC_PRR, 
     :                 OPC_DSTK, OPC_WRT, OPC_OPS



*  Declare character variables:
      CHARACTER OPC_SYM( IRQ__MXINS )*(OPC__MXSSZ)! Recognised symbols
                                   ! which can be included within the 
                                   ! supplied expression.
*  Delare common block:
      COMMON /IRQ_COI/ OPC_SYM
