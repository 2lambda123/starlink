      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_GET( LOCS, SLOT, QNAME, FIXED, VALUE, BIT, COMMNT,
     :                     RDONLY, FIXBIT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_GET

*  Purpose:
*     Get a quality name from a given slot.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_GET( LOCS, SLOT, QNAME, FIXED, VALUE, BIT, COMMNT,
*                    RDONLY, FIXBIT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The quality information is retrieved from the given slot. If the
*     slot is not currently in use, and error is reported.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS( 5 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A set of 5 HDS locators. LOCS( 1 ) locates a temporary
*        structure holding a cloned NDF identifier. LOCS(2) locates the
*        QUAL array. LOCS(3) locates the LAST_USED value, holding the
*        index of the last used slot in the QUAL array. LOCS(4) locates
*        the NFREE value, holding the number of free slots in the QUAL
*        array. LOCS(5) locates the FREE array, which contains a stack
*        of the NFREE slot indices corresponding to free slots. This
*        stack is accessed in a "First-In-Last-Out" method.
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index at which the required information is stored in the
*        QUAL array.
*     QNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The quality name.
*     FIXED = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if all or none of the pixels hold the quality. False is
*        some do and some don't.
*     VALUE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If FIXED is true and VALUE is true, then the quality is held
*        by all pixels by default.  If FIXED is true and VALUE is
*        false, then the quality is held by no pixels. If FIXED is
*        false, then VALUE is indeterminate.
*     BIT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        BIT holds the corresponding bit number in the QUALITY component. 
*        The least-significant bit is called Bit 1 (not Bit 0). A value
*        of zero is returned if the quality has no associated bit in the 
*        quality array. In this case, the FIXED argument will indicate if 
*        all pixel do, or do not, hold the quality.
*     COMMNT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        A descriptive comment stored with the name.
*     RDONLY = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        The read-only flag for the quality name.
*     FIXBIT = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        The "fixed bit" flag for the quality name. True if the bit
*        number associated with the quality name should never be changed.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
