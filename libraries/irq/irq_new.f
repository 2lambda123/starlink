      SUBROUTINE IRQ_NEW( INDF, XNAME, LOCS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_NEW

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new structure to hold quality name information within an
*     NDF extension.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_NEW( INDF, XNAME, LOCS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An HDS object (named QUALITY_NAMES) is created to hold quality
*     name information within the specified NDF extension. An error is
*     reported if the NDF extension does not exist. If the extension does
*     exist, an array of five HDS locators is returned which is needed
*     when calling other IRQ routines. The first locator points to a
*     temporary object which holds a cloned identifier for the NDF,
*     the other four point to components of the QUALITY_NAMES structure
*     contained in the NDF. IRQ_RLSE should be called to annul these
*     locators (and the NDF identifier) when no further access to the
*     NDFs quality names information is required.
*
*     The QUALITY component of the NDF is reset to an undefined state by
*     this routine. Therefore, the QUALITY component should not be mapped
*     for access prior to calling this routine.
*
*     The LOCS argument returned by this routine specifies the NDF
*     which will be operated on by subsequent IRQ routines.
*     Specifically, LOCS determines the bounds of the NDF. Care should
*     therefore be taken that subsequent calls to IRQ routines refer to
*     the NDF specified by the INDF argument to this routine, and not
*     for instance to a section of the NDF which will in general have
*     different bounds.
*
*     Note, an error is reported if only READ access is available to the
*     NDF.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     XNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the NDF extension in which the quality name
*        information is to be stored. If this extension does not exist
*        then an error is reported.
*     LOCS(5) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        A set of HDS locators as described above.  The character
*        variables supplied for this argument should have a declared
*        length equal to symbolic constant DAT__SZLOC. These locator
*        are annulled by calling IRQ_RLSE.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
