      SUBROUTINE IRQ_SETQ( LOCS, QNAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_SETQ

*  Purpose:
*     Assign a given quality to all pixels in the NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_SETQ( LOCS, QNAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The quality specified by QNAME is assigned to all pixels in the
*     NDF specified by LOCS (LOCS should be obtained either by calling
*     IRQ_FIND or IRQ_NEW). An error is reported if the quality name is
*     undefined within the NDF.
*
*     Note, write or update access must be available for the NDF (as
*     set up by routine LPG_ASSOC for instance).
*
*  Arguments:
*     LOCS(5) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An array of five HDS locators. These locators identify the NDF
*        and the associated quality name information.  They should have
*        been obtained using routine IRQ_FIND or routine IRQ_NEW.
*     QNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The quality name to assign to all pixels in the NDF. This
*        quality name must be defined in the NDF specified by LOC. Name
*        definitions can be added to the NDF using routine IRQ_ADDQN.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
