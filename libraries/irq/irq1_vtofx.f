      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_VTOFX( N, QVALUE, NOPC, OPCODE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_VTOFX

*  Purpose:
*     Replace a "LOAD QUALITY" instruction with "LOAD constant".

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_VTOFX( N, QVALUE, NOPC, OPCODE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A compiled quality expression contains a list of instructions
*     which describe the operations which must be performed to evaluate
*     the quality expression. One of these "op. codes" instructs the
*     processing routine to put a quality value on the stack. This is
*     the "LOAD QUALITY" op. code.
*
*     The supplied list of op. codes is searched for the Nth "LOAD
*     QUALITY" op. code which is replaced by the "LOAD FALSE" or "LOAD
*     TRUE" op. codes, depending on the value of QVALUE. These two op.
*     codes cause the processing routine to load either .false.  or a
*     .true. value on to the stack.
*
*  Arguments:
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The position of the quality to be replaced, within the list of
*        all qualities referenced in the quality expression.
*     QVALUE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        The constant value with which to replace the variable quality.
*     NOPC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of op codes in OPCODE.
*     OPCODE( NOPC ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The op codes.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Global Constants:

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER N

      INTEGER NOPC

*  Arguments Given and Returned:
      INTEGER OPCODE( NOPC )

*  Status:
      INTEGER STATUS             ! Global status

*  Include definitions of all instructions an op. codes:

*  Local Variables:

*  Loop round all the op. codes in the compiled quality expression.

*  Check to see if the quality to be loaded is the one which is to
*  be replaced by a fixed value.

*  If it is, then replace the op code with a "LOAD TRUE" or "LOAD FALSE"
*  op code, dependant on the supplied constant quality value.
