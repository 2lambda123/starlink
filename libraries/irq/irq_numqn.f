      SUBROUTINE IRQ_NUMQN( LOCS, NAMES, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_NUMQN

*  Purpose:
*     Return number of defined quality names.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_NUMQN( LOCS, NAMES, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The number of quality names defined in the NDF specified by
*     LOCS is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS(5) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An array of five HDS locators. These locators identify the NDF
*        and the associated quality name information.  They should have
*        been obtained using routine IRQ_FIND or routine IRQ_NEW.
*     NAMES = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of quality names defined in the structure located by
*        LOCS.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Check inherited global status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  Obtain the NDF identifier from LOCS, and check it is still valid.
      CALL IRQ1_INDF( LOCS, INDF, STATUS )

*  Get the number of free slots stored in the QUAL array.
      CALL DAT_GET0I( LOCS(4), NFREE, STATUS )

*  Get the total size of the QUAL array.

*  The number of defined names is the difference.
