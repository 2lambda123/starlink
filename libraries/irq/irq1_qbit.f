      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_QBIT( LOCS, BIT, QNAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_QBIT

*  Purpose:
*     Find the quality name associated with a specified bit number.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_QBIT( LOCS, BIT, QNAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Each slot in the QUAL array is examined to see if it is currently
*     associated with the specified bit number. If it is, the
*     corresponding quality name is returned in QNAME. Otherwise, a blank
*     quality name is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS( 5 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A set of five HDS locators. LOCS( 1 ) locates a temporary
*        structure holding a cloned NDF identifier. LOCS(2) locates the
*        QUAL array. LOCS(3) locates the LAST_USED value, holding the
*        index of the last used slot in the QUAL array. LOCS(4) locates
*        the NFREE value, holding the number of free slots in the QUAL
*        array. LOCS(5) locates the FREE array, which contains a stack
*        of the NFREE slot indices corresponding to free slots. This
*        stack is accessed in a "First-In-Last-Out" method.
*     BIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The bit number to search for.
*     QNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The quality name associated with the given bit number, or blank
*        if the bit number is currently unused.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
