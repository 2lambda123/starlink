      SUBROUTINE IRQ_SYNTX( QEXP, ERRPNT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_SYNTX

*  Purpose:
*     Check the syntax of a quality expression.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_SYNTX( QEXP, ERRPNT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The syntax of the supplied quality expression is checked, and an
*     error is reported if a syntax error is detected.  If any of the
*     STATUS values IRQ__BADSY, IRQ__MSOPT or IRQ__MSOPD are returned
*     (all of which correspond to various forms of syntax error in the
*     quality expression, see ID6 appendix E), a pointer to the
*     approximate position of the error within the quality expression
*     is returned in ERRPNT.  Note, in order for a quality expression
*     to compile successfully (using IRQ_COMP), it must not only contain
*     no syntax errors, but must also contain no undefined quality
*     names. IRQ_SYNTX cannot check for undefined quality names.
*
*  Arguments:
*     QEXP = CHARACTER*(*) (Given and Returned)
*        A quality expression. See ID6 section 5 for details of the
*        allowed formats for quality expressions. On exit, the string is
*        converted to upper case and any leading blanks are removed.
*     ERRPNT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        If any of the STATUS values IRQ__BADSY( "Unrecognised logical
*        operator or constant"), IRQ__MSOPT ( "Missing operator") or
*        IRQ__MSOPD ( "Missing operand") are returned, then ERRPNT
*        returns the offset within the quality expression at which the
*        error was detected. Note, the offset refers to the returned
*        form of QEXP, not the given form. These will be different if
*        the given form of QEXP has any leading blanks. An offset of
*        zero is returned if none of the errors associated with the
*        above STATUS values occur.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
