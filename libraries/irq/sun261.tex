\section {\xlabel{SEC:intro}Introduction to QUALITY}

A QUALITY structure is one of the standard components of an NDF
structure, and is described fully in
\xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{the_quality_component_in_more_detail}. Briefly,
if an NDF has a QUALITY component which is in a \emph{defined} state,
then each pixel within the NDF DATA component has a corresponding
value in the QUALITY component. Currently, each QUALITY value consists
of an unsigned byte (\emph{i.e.} 8 bits). In Fortran the
least-significant bit is usually called Bit 0 and the most significant
bit is usually called Bit 7. Within the IRQ package the
least-significant bit is called Bit 1 and the most-significant bit is
called Bit 8. Each bit within the QUALITY value can be used to
indicate if the corresponding pixel in the DATA component holds some
specific \emph{quality}. For instance, Bit 3 of the QUALITY component
may be used to indicate if any DATA pixels are saturated. A particular
pixel in the QUALITY component would have Bit 3 set (\emph{i.e.} equal
to 1) if the corresponding DATA pixel is saturated, or cleared
(\emph{i.e.} equal to 0) if the corresponding DATA pixel is not
saturated.

Another option for flagging saturated data is to replace saturated DATA
pixel values with a `bad' (or `magic') value. This has the disadvantage
that the datum is permanently destroyed by being flagged, and also there
is no distinction between data values thst are set bad because of the
fact they were saturated, and pixels set bad for any other reason.

SUN/33 doesn't specify how the facilities of the QUALITY component are to
be used, and many possibilities exist. Obviously some co-ordination
between applications is needed so that different applications interpret
the QUALITY values in a consistent manner (\{emph{i.e.} using the above
example, later applications must know that Bit 3 is a saturation flag).
The IRQ package provides a set of routines for doing this.

You may be are wondering about the name IRQ.  The library was originally
developed for the IRAS90 package, and its subroutine libraries had IR
prefix.

\section {\xlabel{SEC:IRQ}Introduction to the facilities provided by the
IRQ library}
\label {SEC:IRQ}

IRQ provides a system for handling Boolean qualities (\emph{i.e.}
qualities that are either held or not held by each DATA pixel).  From the
point of view of an application, each defined quality is identified by a
\emph{quality name} rather than by a bit number. Information about these
quality names is stored in an NDF extension, so that later applications
can determine which pixels within the NDF hold a given quality (or
combination of qualities).

Within IRQ, each defined quality name is usually associated with a bit in
the QUALITY array, and this bit is set if the corresponding DATA pixels
are assigned the specified quality. A typical application need know
nothing about which QUALITY bit is associated with which quality name.
For instance, if \emph{every} pixel in an NDF holds a certain quality (or
alternatively, if \emph{no} pixels hold the quality), then it is not
necessary to reserve a bit in the QUALITY array to represent the quality.
Instead, a single Boolean scalar value can be stored with the quality
name in the NDF extension. This scalar is set to \texttt{.TRUE.} if \emph{all} pixels hold the quality, and \texttt{.FALSE.} if \emph{no} pixels hold
the quality. In this way, the number of defined quality names can
sometimes exceed the number of bits in the QUALITY component. The
handling of such situations is done within IRQ and is completely
invisible to the calling application.

IRQ provides the following facilities.
\begin{itemize}
\item Add quality name definitions (and associated descriptive comments)
to an NDF. There is a limit to the number of quality names which may be
defined within an NDF. The exact number depends on how many quality names
require a QUALITY bit, but it will always be at least eight.
\item Remove quality name definitions from an NDF.
\item List all quality names defined within an NDF.
\item Assign a given quality to selected pixels.
\item Remove a given quality from selected pixels.
\item Set `bad' those pixels of a supplied array which hold a certain
combination of qualities.
\end{itemize}

\section {A Set of Four Typical IRQ Applications}

The \KAPPA\ package contains a set of four typical IRQ applications,
which give an indication of the benefits which IRQ can provide for the
user. The A-TASK documentation for these four applications is included
in \xref{SUN/95}{sun95}{se_qualitymask}, and they are briefly described
in this section.

\subsection{SETQUAL}

\xref{SETQUAL}{sun95}{SETQUAL} creates quality name definitions and
stores them within a specified extension of an NDF. It also assigns a
specified quality to a sub-set of the pixels with the NDF. In its
simplest mode, the user provides an NDF, and a string to use as a quality
name (such as \texttt{SATURATED}). If this quality name is not already
defined within the NDF, then it is added to the list of defined quality
names, together with a user-supplied comment describing the quality. The
user also provides another NDF to be used as a `mask'. The `bad' pixels
within the mask NDF define the pixels which are to be assigned the given
quality. For instance, a user may have an image containing saturated
pixels. If he wants these pixels flagged without being permanently
destroyed, he could proceed as follows.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Produce a mask NDF from the original NDF by setting all DATA pixels
above the saturation value to the `bad' value.

\item Run SETQUAL on the original NDF, giving some quality name such as
\texttt{SATURATED}, and specifying the mask created in the previous step. This
leaves the DATA component of the original NDF unchanged, but assigns the
quality \texttt{SATURATED} to all the pixels which correspond to `bad'
pixels in the mask.

\end{enumerate}

Alternatively, instead of using a mask, the pixels to which the quality is
assigned may be specified by an explicit list of pixel indices stored in a
text file.

\subsection{REMQUAL}

The \xref{REMQUAL}{sun95}{REMQUAL} application removes quality name
definitions from an NDF. This may be necessary if there is no room for
any more quality name definitions within an NDF. In this case the user
may choose to remove some unimportant quality name definitions to make
room for new, more-important quality names. REMQUAL can also remove \emph{all} quality names information from an NDF. This can be useful if for any
reason the quality-name information becomes corrupted.

\subsection{SHOWQUAL}
The \xref{SHOWQUAL}{sun95}{SHOWQUAL} application displays all currently
defined quality names within an NDF, together with the associated
descriptive comments. Optionally, the number of pixels that hold each
quality can be displayed.

\subsection{QUALTOBAD}

The \xref{QUALTOBAD}{sun95}{QUALTOBAD} application sets selected
pixels within an NDF to the `bad' value on the basis of the pixel's
quality. In effect, QUALTOBAD performs the reverse operation of
\xref{SETQUAL}{SETQUAL}. For instance, using the example of saturated
data described above, the user may remove some varying background surface
from his original data, and then want to set pixels which were saturated
in the original data to the `bad' value . In this case he would run
QUALTOBAD specifying the background removed NDF as input, and specifying
a \emph{quality expression} of \texttt{SATURATED}. This would cause all pixels
which hold the quality \texttt{SATURATED} to be set bad in the output NDF.

The `quality expression' can be more complex than a single quality
name. In fact, a quality expression can consist of several quality
names combined together using the usual operators of Boolean algebra.
For instance, if the quality expression \texttt{SATURATED.AND..NOT.(SOURCE\_A .OR. SOURCE\_B)} was given to
QUALTOBAD, then pixels would be set `bad' only if they had the quality
\texttt{SATURATED}, but did not have either of the qualities \texttt{SOURCE\_A} or \texttt{SOURCE\_B}.

\section{Quality Names}

A quality name must contain 15 or fewer characters. Any leading blanks
are removed from supplied quality names, and they are converted to
upper case before being stored in the NDF. Quality names may contain
embedded blanks, but may not contain full-stop (\texttt{"."}) characters.
Certain names are reserved and may not be used. These are \texttt{ANY},
\texttt{IRQ\_BAD\_SLOT} and \texttt{IRQ\_FREE\_SLOT}.

\section{\xlabel{SEC:QEXP}Quality Expressions}
\label{SEC:QEXP}

A `Quality Expression' consists of a set of quality names combined
together using Boolean operators into a legal Boolean expression. See
\latexhtml{Section~\ref{SEC:QFIND}}{\htmlref{this section}{SEC:QFIND}}
for a description of the use of quality expressions within IRQ. In the
following, the symbols \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} are used to represent two
qualities. These can be considered as Boolean values; \texttt{true} if a
pixel holds the quality, and \texttt{false} otherwise. The supported
Boolean operators are listed below.

\begin {description}
\item [.AND.] - The expression \texttt{(A.AND.B)} is true if and only if
both \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} are true.
\item [.OR.] - The expression \texttt{(A.OR.B)} is true if and only if
either \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} is true.
\item [.XOR.] - The
expression \texttt{(A.XOR.B)} is true if and only if either \texttt{A} is true and \texttt{B}
is false, or \texttt{A} is false and \texttt{B} is true.
\item [.EQV.] - The expression \texttt{(A.EQV.B)} is true if and only if either \texttt{A}
is true and \texttt{B} is true, or A is false and \texttt{B} is false.
\item [.NOT.] - The expression \texttt{(.NOT.A)} is true if and only if \texttt{A} is
false.
\end{description}
In addition to the above operators, the Boolean constants \texttt{.FALSE.} and \texttt{.TRUE.} can be included within a quality expression.
Expressions may contain several levels of nested parentheses.

The precedence of these operators decreases in the following order;
.NOT., .AND., .OR., .XOR., .EQV. (the final two have equal
precedence). In an expression such as \texttt{(A.XOR.B.EQV.C.XOR.D)} in
which all operators have equal precedence, the evaluation proceeds
from left to right., \emph{i.e.} the expression is evaluated as
(((A.XOR.B).EQV.C).XOR.D). If there is any doubt about the order in
which an expression will be evaluated, parentheses should be used to
ensure the required order of evaluation.

Some attempts are made to simplify a quality expression to reduce the
run time needed to evaluate the expression for every pixel.

Quality expressions can be up to 254 characters long, and must not
contain more than forty symbols (Boolean operators, constants, or
quality names).

\section {Using IRQ routines}

This section gives a brief outline of the IRQ routines which are
available to perform some common tasks. The specific details required
to use these routines are not included here but can be found in the
subroutine specifications contained in \latexhtml{Appendix~\ref
{SEC:FULLSPEC}}{\htmlref{the full specifications}{SEC:FULLSPEC}}.

\subsection {\xlabel{SEC:CON}Constants and Error Values}
\label {SEC:CON}

The IRQ package has associated with it various symbolic constants.
These values consist of a name of up to five characters prefixed by
``IRQ\_\_'' (note the \emph{double} underscore), and can be made
available to an application by including the following line at the
start of the routines which uses them:

\begin{terminalv}
      INCLUDE 'IRQ_PAR'
\end{terminalv}

This assumes that the IRQ library has been installed as part of the
UNIX Starlink Software Collection.
% If this is not the case, then the alternative instructions given in
%Appendix~\ref {APP:NOSTAR} should be followed.

The values thus defined are described in the following sections, and
also in the subroutine specifications. Another set of symbolic
constants is made available by the statements

\begin{terminalv}
      INCLUDE 'IRQ_ERR'
\end{terminalv}

These values have the same format of those contained in IRQ\_PAR, put define
various error conditions which can be generated within the IRQ package.
Applications can compare the $STATUS$ argument with these values to check for
specific error conditions. These values are described in
\latexhtml{Appendix~\ref {APP:ERRORS}}{\htmlref{IRQ Error
Codes}{APP:ERRORS}}.

\subsection{Initialising an NDF for use with IRQ}

Certain HDS structures must be created within an NDF before the NDF can
be used by IRQ. These structures hold information describing the
currently defined quality names within the NDF. Routine
\htmlref{IRQ\_FIND}{IRQ_FIND} can be used to see if such structures exist
within an NDF (see below). If no such structure yet exists within an NDF,
routine \htmlref{IRQ\_NEW}{IRQ_NEW} must be called to create the
structure. This structure is held in a specified NDF extension. IRQ\_NEW
returns an array of HDS locators which must be passed to subsequent IRQ
routines. One of these locators points to a cloned copy of the NDF
identifier. All access to the NDF by subsequent IRQ routines is achieved
through this cloned identifier. Once access to the quality names
information is no longer required, the resources used by these HDS
locators (including the cloned NDF identifier) should be annulled by
calling IRQ\_RLSE. Note, routines \htmlref{IRQ\_ANNUL}{IRQ_ANNUL} and
\htmlref{IRQ\_CLOSE}{IRQ_CLOSE} play no part in releasing resources used
for accessing quality name information. These two routines are only used
for releasing resources used to store \emph{compiled quality expressions}
(see \latexhtml{Section~\ref {SEC:QFIND}}{\htmlref{ a description
here}{SEC:QFIND}}). IRQ\_RLSE is the only routine which needs
to be called to release resources used for accessing \emph{quality names}.


\subsection{Using previously initialised NDFs within IRQ}

If the NDF has been initialised for use by IRQ, then the structure
holding the quality names information must be found before other IRQ
routines can be called. Routine \htmlref{IRQ\_FIND}{IRQ_FIND} does this.
This routine looks through all the NDF extensions until a suitable
structure is found. If no such structure is found the status value
\texttt{IRQ\_\_NOQNI} is returned. If more than one extension contains such a
structure, then the status value \texttt{IRQ\_\_MULT} is returned. If the routine
runs successfully, then an array of HDS locators is returned similar to
the array returned by IRQ\_NEW. Once access to the quality names
information is no longer required, the resources used by these HDS
locators (including the cloned NDF identifier) should be annulled by
calling \htmlref{IRQ\_RLSE}{IRQ_RLSE}.

\subsection{Accessing the quality names information stored in an NDF}

To access the quality names information stored within an NDF, a set of
HDS locators to the information must first be obtained by calling either
\htmlref{IRQ\_NEW}{IRQ_NEW} or \htmlref{IRQ\_FIND}{IRQ_FIND}\latex{ (see
above)}. Once this has been done the information can be read, modified,
or added to. \htmlref{IRQ\_ADDQN}{IRQ_ADDQN} adds a new quality name
definition to an NDF (so long as there is room for it within the
structures and the QUALITY component). \htmlref{IRQ\_CHKQN}{IRQ_CHKQN}
checks to see if a given name is defined. \htmlref{IRQ\_GETQN}{IRQ_GETQN}
searches for a specified quality name, and returns various items of
information about it (such as which bit of the QUALITY component it is
assigned to). \htmlref{IRQ\_NUMQN}{IRQ_NUMQN} returns the number of
defined quality names. \htmlref{IRQ\_NXTQN}{IRQ_NXTQN} returns the next
defined quality name. Repeated calls to IRQ\_NXTQN can be made to get a
list of all the quality names defined within an NDF.
\htmlref{IRQ\_REMQN}{IRQ_REMQN} removes the definition of a quality name
from an NDF, so long as the quality name has not been flagged as
`read-only' (see \htmlref{IRQ\_RWQN}{IRQ_RWQN}).

\subsection{Assigning and removing qualities to and from NDF pixels}

Once quality names have been defined, they can be assigned to selected
pixels within the NDF. There are two ways of specifying which pixels are
`selected'. Routine \htmlref{IRQ\_SETQM}{IRQ_SETQM} requires a mask image
to be provided in which the `bad' pixels define the pixels in the NDF
DATA component to which the quality is to be assigned. Routine
\htmlref{IRQ\_SETQL}{IRQ_SETQL} requires a list of pixel indices to be
provided which defines the pixels in the NDF DATA component to which the
quality is to be assigned. The quality of the NDF pixels which are \emph{not} selected is left unchanged. Thus, if an unselected pixel already has
the specified quality, these routines will not \emph{remove} the quality
from those pixels.

The routines \htmlref{IRQ\_RESQM}{IRQ_RESQM} and
\htmlref{IRQ\_RESQL}{IRQ_RESQL}, are complementary to
\htmlref{IRQ\_SETQM}{IRQ_SETQM} and \htmlref{IRQ\_SETQL}{IRQ_SETQL}.
Instead of ensuring that the selected pixels hold the specified quality,
these routines ensure that the selected pixels \emph{do not} hold the
specified quality. Again, the quality of unselected pixels is left
unchanged.

Routine \htmlref{IRQ\_SETQ}{IRQ_SETQ} ensures that \emph{all} pixels in an
NDF have a specified quality, and routine IRQ\_RESQ ensures that \emph{no}
pixels in an NDF have a specified quality.

The routine \htmlref{IRQ\_CNTQ}{IRQ_CNTQ} will count the number of bits
set in each bit plane in the QUALITY component.

\subsection{\xlabel{SEC:QFIND}Finding NDF pixels which satisfy a quality expression}
\label {SEC:QFIND}

If a subset of pixels are to be operated on by an application, the
application will usually obtain a quality expression from the user which
defines the pixels to be operated on. That is to say, pixels which have
qualities which do not satisfy the quality expression would not usually
be used by the application. The quality expression is usually obtained
from the user using the \xref{ADAM parameter system}{sun114}{}. It is
then passed to \htmlref{IRQ\_COMP}{IRQ_COMP} to be compiled. If any
problems are detected with the expression (such as syntax errors, or
undefined quality names) IRQ\_COMP will report an error, and it is then
up to the applications to decide what to do. Typically, it will flush the
error, and reprompt the user for a new quality expression. The routine
\htmlref{IRQ\_SYNTX}{IRQ_SYNTX} will check a quality expression for
syntax errors without actually compiling it or checking that the
referenced quality names are defined.

If IRQ\_COMP successfully compiles the quality expression, it returns an
identifier for the compiled quality expression. This identifier is
actually a pointer to a temporary HDS structure holding information about
the quality expression. The identifier is passed to
\htmlref{IRQ\_SBAD}{IRQ_SBADx} which locates all NDF pixels that have
qualities that satisfy the quality expression. The corresponding pixels
in an array supplied to IRQ\_SBAD are set `bad'. The other pixels are
left unchanged. Alternatively, pixels with qualities which \emph{do not}
satisfy the quality expression can be set bad in the supplied array.
Note, the array supplied to IRQ\_SBAD must be the same shape and size as
the NDF supplied to \htmlref{IRQ\_FIND}{IRQ_FIND} or
\htmlref{IRQ\_NEW}{IRQ_NEW}. If an NDF section was used, then the array
supplied to IRQ\_SBAD must be the same shape and size as the NDF section,
\emph{not} the base NDF.

Up to ten compiled quality expressions can be active at once. The
identifiers for each compiled quality expression should be annulled
when it is no longer needed by calling
\htmlref{IRQ\_ANNUL}{IRQ_ANNUL}. \htmlref{IRQ\_CLOSE}{IRQ_CLOSE}
should be called when all compiled quality expressions have been
finished with.

\section {Compiling and Linking with IRQ}
\label{SEC:LINK}
This section describes how to compile and link applications which use IRQ
subroutines, on UNIX systems. It is assumed that the IRQ library
is installed as part of the Starlink Software Collection.


\subsection{Standalone Applications}
Standalone applications which use IRQ\_ routines may be linked by
including execution of the command ``irq\_link'' on the compiler
command line. Thus, to compile and link a Fortran application called
``prog'', the following might be used:

\begin{small}
\begin{terminalv}
% f77 -I$STARLINK_DIR/include prog.f -L$STARLINK_DIR/lib `irq_link` -o prog
\end{terminalv}
\end{small}

Note the use of backward quote characters, which cause the
``irq\_link'' command to be executed and its result substituted into
the compiler command.

\subsection{\label{ss:buildingadamapplications}ADAM Applications}
Users of the \xref{ADAM}{sg4}{} programming environment
\latex{(SG/4)} should use
the \xref{\textbf{alink}}{sun144}{ADAM_link_scripts} command
(\xref{SUN/144}{sun144}{}) to compile and link applications, and can
access the IRQ\_ library by including execution of the command
\texttt{irq\_link\_adam} on the command line, as follows:

\begin{small}
\begin{terminalv}
% alink adamprog.f `irq_link_adam`
\end{terminalv}
\end{small}

where \texttt{adamprog.f} is the Fortran source file for the A-TASK. Again
note the use of opening apostrophies (`) instead of the more usual
closing apostrophy (') in the above \textbf{alink} command.

To build a program written in C (instead of Fortran), simply name the
source file \texttt{adamprog.c}, instead of \texttt{adamprog.f}.

   Assign a fixed bit number to a quality name

      This routine associates a fixed bit number with a specified quality
      name. Normally, IRQ manages the allocation of bit numbers to named
      qualities, but this routine allows the calling application to specify
      which bit is to be used for a given quality.

      By default, a QUALITY-array bit is associated with a quality name
      only if some pixels hold the quality and some do not hold the
      quality (\emph{i.e.} there is a mix of values). Otherwise, a flag is stored
      in the QUALITY\_NAMES structure indicating this, and any quality bit
      previously associated with the quality name is released for re-use.

      This default behaviour is changed by calling this routine. The
      specified bit number will continue to be associated with the quality
      name even if all pixels do, or do not, hold the quality.

      An error will be returned if the named quality is already associated

\section {HDS Data Structures}

The IRQ package uses several different HDS data structures. These are
described in this appendix. HDS \emph{names} are indicated by being
placed within square brackets ({[} {]}), and HDS \emph{types} are
indicated by being placed within angled brackets ($<$ $>$).

\subsection{Quality names information stored in an NDF}

Information describing the quality names which are defined within an
NDF is stored in a structure called {[}\textbf{QUALITY\_NAMES}{]}, with
HDS \emph{type} $<$\textbf{QUALITY\_NAMES}$>$. This structure can be
stored in any extension within the NDF. The components of this
structure are shown in \latexhtml{Table~\ref {TAB:QN}}{the table
below}.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\latex{\caption{Components of a $<$\textbf{QUALITY\_NAMES}$>$ structure}}
\html{\caption{\textbf{1:} Components of a $<$\textbf{QUALITY\_NAMES}$>$ structure}}
\label{TAB:QN}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Component Name & TYPE & Brief Description \\ \hline
{[}\textbf{QUAL}{]} & $<$\textbf{IRQ\_QUAL}$>$ & Vector of quality name definitions\\
{[}\textbf{LAST\_USED}{]} & $<$\textbf{\_INTEGER}$>$ & Highest used index within
{[}\textbf{QUAL}{]}\\
{[}\textbf{NFREE}{]} & $<$\textbf{\_INTEGER}$>$ & No. of un-used cells within
{[}\textbf{QUAL}{]}\\
{[}\textbf{FREE}(NFREE){]} & $<$\textbf{\_INTEGER}$>$ & Vector holding indices of
un-used cells in {[}\textbf{QUAL}{]}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The {[}\textbf{QUAL}{]} component is a vector in which each cell is a
structure holding various items of information needed to define a
single quality name. The array has an initial size of 8 but is
increased if necessary. There will usually be some unused cells within
{[}\textbf{QUAL}{]}, and the other components of the {[}\textbf{QUALITY\_NAMES}{]} structure listed in \latexhtml{Table~\ref
{TAB:QN}}{Table~1} are used to locate these unused cells. In
particular, {[}\textbf{FREE}{]} is a vector which holds the indices of
all unused cells within {[}\textbf{QUAL}{]}. These indices may appear in
any order within in {[}\textbf{FREE}{]}.

The set of five HDS locators returned by routines
\htmlref{IRQ\_NEW}{IRQ_NEW} and \htmlref{IRQ\_FIND}{IRQ_FIND} include
locators to each of the four components of the {[}\textbf{QUALITY\_NAMES}{]} structure, together with a locator for a temporary
HDS structure holding a single $<$\textbf{\_INTEGER}$>$ scalar used to
store the cloned NDF identifier.

The information describing each individual quality name is stored in a single
cell of the {[}\textbf{QUAL}{]} vector. The components within each cell of this
array are listed in
\latexhtml{Table~\ref {TAB:QUAL}}{Table~2}.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\latex{\caption{Components of a $<$\textbf{IRQ\_QUAL}$>$ structure}}
\html{\caption{\textbf{2:} Components of a $<$\textbf{IRQ\_QUAL}$>$ structure}}
\label{TAB:QUAL}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Component Name & TYPE & Brief Description \\ \hline
{[}\textbf{NAME}{]} & $<$\textbf{\_CHAR$\ast$15}$>$ & A quality name (maximum of
\\
{[}\textbf{FIXED}{]} & $<$\textbf{\_LOGICAL}$>$ & True if all pixels are in the same
state\\
{[}\textbf{VALUE}{]} & $<$\textbf{\_LOGICAL}$>$ & The state of all pixels, if fixed\\
{[}\textbf{BIT}{]} & $<$\textbf{\_INTEGER}$>$ & QUALITY bit used to store this
quality\\
{[}\textbf{COMMENT}{]} & $<$\textbf{\_CHAR$\ast$}$>$ & A descriptive comment for the
quality\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

If \emph{all} pixels hold a given quality, or if \emph{no} pixels hold
the quality, then a true value is stored for {[}\textbf{FIXED}{]}. A true
value is stored for {[}\textbf{VALUE}{]} if \emph{all} pixels hold the
quality, and a false value if \emph{no} pixels hold the quality. In
either case, {[}\textbf{BIT}{]} is ignored since no QUALITY bit needs to
be reserved for the quality name, thus allowing more than eight
quality names to be defined simultaneously.

If some pixels \emph{do} hold the quality but some \emph{do not}, then a
false value is stored for {[}\textbf{FIXED}{]} and {[}\textbf{VALUE}{]} is
ignored. In this case, a QUALITY bit is reserved to represent the
quality and its bit number (in the range 1 to 8) is stored in {[}\textbf{BIT}{]}.

\subsection{Temporary structures used to hold compiled quality
expressions} When routine \htmlref{IRQ\_COMP}{IRQ_COMP} is called to
compile a quality expression, the resulting information (known as a
`compiled quality expression') is stored in a temporary HDS structure.
Up to ten compiled quality expressions can exist simultaneously, each
being stored in one cell of an array of temporary structures. The
identifier returned by IRQ\_COMP is just an index within this array.
Each cell of the array has an HDS \emph{name} of {[}\textbf{QEXP}{]} and
an HDS \emph{type} of $<$\textbf{QEXP}$>$, and contains the components
listed in \latexhtml{Table~\ref {TAB:QEXP}}{Table 3}.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\latex{\caption{Components of a $<$\textbf{QEXP}$>$ structure}}
\html{\caption{\textbf{3:} Components of a $<$\textbf{QEXP}$>$ structure}}
\label{TAB:QEXP}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Component Name & TYPE & Brief Description \\ \hline
{[}\textbf{MASKS}{]} & $<$\textbf{\_INTEGER}$>$ & A vector of bit masks\\
{[}\textbf{OPCODE}{]} & $<$\textbf{\_INTEGER}$>$ & A vector of instruction codes\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Each bit mask held in {[}\textbf{MASKS}{]} specifies a set of QUALITY bits which
are to be tested as part of the evaluation of a quality expression performed by
routine IRQ\_SBAD. The instruction codes held in {[}\textbf{OPCODE}{]} represent
the operations which must be performed on a ``First In - Last Out'' stack in
order to evaluate a quality expression. The sizes of theses vectors are held in
common.

\section {Examples of Using IRQ}
\label{APP:EXAMS}
\subsection {Adding a new quality name}

This example shows a code fragment which adds the quality name \texttt{SATURATED} to an NDF and then assigns the quality to all pixels with
value greater than 10.0. An error is reported if the quality name is
already in use.

Programming notes:

\begin{enumerate}

\label{NOTE1}
\item NDFIN is the NDF identifier for the input NDF and should have been
obtained previously. If the NDF contains no quality name information, then
an error will be reported by \htmlref{IRQ\_FIND}{IRQ_FIND}.

\label{NOTE2}
\item The quality expression must be assigned to a character variable,
since the call to \htmlref{IRQ\_COMP}{IRQ_COMP} updates the expression by
removing leading blanks, and converting the expression to upper case. An
access violation would result if a literal string were supplied as an
argument, instead of a character variable. If either of the quality names
\texttt{SATURATED} or \texttt{BACKGROUND} is not defined in the input NDF, then
an error will be reported by IRQ\_COMP, and the undefined names will be
returned in the UNDEF array.

\end{enumerate}

\section {Packages Called by IRQ}

IRQ\_ makes calls to the following packages:
\begin {description}
\item [CHR\_] - The CHR character handling package; see \xref{SUN/40}{sun40}{}.
\item [CMP\_] - HDS; see  \xref{SUN/92}{sun92}{}.
\item [DAT\_] - HDS; see SUN/92.
\item [ERR\_] - The Starlink error reporting package; see \xref{SUN/104}{sun104}{}.
\item [MSG\_] - The Starlink message reporting package; see SUN/104.
\item [NDF\_] - The NDF access package; see  \xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{}.
\item [VEC\_] - The PRIMDAT package; see  \xref{SUN/39}{sun39}{}.
\end{description}

Access to these packages, together with packages called from within these
packages, is necessary to use IRQ.
