      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_QSET( BIT, SET, SIZE, QUAL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_QSET

*  Purpose:
*     Set a QUALITY bit for all pixels.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_QSET( BIT, SET, SIZE, QUAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     If SET is true then all pixels in the QUALITY vector have the
*     specified bit set. If SET is false, then all pixels have
*     the specified bit cleared.

*  Arguments:
*     BIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The bit number within the QUALITY component. The least
*        significant bit is called bit 1 (not bit 0).
*     SET = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then all pixels have the given bit set, indicating
*        that the corresponding quality is held.  If false, then all
*        pixels have the given bit cleared, indicating that the
*        corresponding quality is not held.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the QUAL vector.
*     QUAL( SIZE ) = BYTE (Given and Returned)
*        The QUALITY vector.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  VAX-specific features used:
*     -  Uses BYTE arrays.
*     -  Uses functions IBSET and IBCLR
