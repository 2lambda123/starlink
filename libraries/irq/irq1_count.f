      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_COUNT( SIZE, DATA, NGOOD, NBAD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_COUNT

*  Purpose:
*     Count the good and bad pixels in a vector.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_COUNT( SIZE, DATA, NGOOD, NBAD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The number of good and bad pixels in the input data are returned.
*  Arguments:
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        Size of the data vector.
*     DATA( SIZE ) = REAL (Given)
*        Data vector.
*     NGOOD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of pixels in DATA not equal to VAL__BADR.
*     NBAD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of pixels in DATA equal to VAL__BADR.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
