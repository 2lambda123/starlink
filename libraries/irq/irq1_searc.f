      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_SEARC( LOCS, QNAME, FIXED, VALUE, BIT, COMMNT,
     :                       RDONLY, FIXBIT, SLOT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_SEARC

*  Purpose:
*     Search for a given quality name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_SEARC( LOCS, QNAME, FIXED, VALUE, BIT, COMMNT,
*                      RDONLY, FIXBIT, SLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied name is compared with each name stored in the QUAL
*     array until a match is found or the last used slot is reached.
*     If the name is not found, an error is reported and STATUS returned
*     equal to IRQ__NOQNM.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS( 5 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A set of 5 HDS locators. LOCS( 1 ) locates a temporary
*        structure holding a cloned NDF identifier. LOCS(2) locates the
*        QUAL array. LOCS(3) locates the LAST_USED value, holding the
*        index of the last used slot in the QUAL array. LOCS(4) locates
*        the NFREE value, holding the number of free slots in the QUAL
*        array. LOCS(5) locates the FREE array, which contains a stack
*        of the NFREE slot indices corresponding to free slots. This
*        stack is accessed in a "First-In-Last-Out" method.
*     QNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The quality name to search for.
*     FIXED = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if all or none of the pixels hold the quality. False is
*        some do and some don't.
*     VALUE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If FIXED is true and VALUE is true, then the quality is held
*        by all pixels by default.  If FIXED is true and VALUE is
*        false, then the quality is held by no pixels. If FIXED is
*        false, then VALUE is indeterminate.
*     BIT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The bit number within the QUALITY component which corresponds
*        to the quality name. If the quality name has no corresponding
*        quality bit, then zero is returned.
*     COMMNT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        A descriptive comment stored with the name.
*     RDONLY = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        The read-only flag for the quality name.
*     FIXBIT = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        A flag indicating if the bit number associated with the quality
*        name should never be changed (even if all pixels hold, or do not
*        hold, the quality).
*     SLOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index at which the name is stored in the QUAL array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
