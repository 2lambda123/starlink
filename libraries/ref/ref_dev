#  Name:
#     ref_dev

#  Purpose:
#     Create links to REF include files.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script sets up (or removes) symbolic links in the current
#     working directory which refer to REF public include files. It
#     exists to allow source code which contains references to the
#     standard public REF include files to be compiled without having
#     to know where these files actually reside.

#  Invocation:
#     ref_dev
#        Sets up links for all ths REF public include files.
#     ref_dev remove
#        Removes the links previously set up.

#  Notes:
#     The pathname of the installation include directory (INSTALL_INC)
#     must be edited into this script when it is installed.
