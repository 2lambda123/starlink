      SUBROUTINE REF_ANNUL( LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     REF_ANNUL

*  Purpose:
*     Annul a locator to a referenced object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL REF_ANNUL( LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine annuls the locator and, if the locator was linked to
*     group $$REFERENCED$, issues HDS_CLOSE for the container file of
*     the object.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given and Returned)
*        Locator to be annulled.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Inherited global status.

*  Notes:
*     This routine attempts to execute even if STATUS is set on entry,
*     although no further error report will be made if it subsequently
*     fails under these circumstances. In particular, it will fail if
*     the locator supplied is not initially valid, but this will only
*     be reported if STATUS is set to SAI__OK on entry.
