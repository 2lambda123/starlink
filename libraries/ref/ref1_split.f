      SUBROUTINE REF1_SPLIT( PATH, MAXLEV, NLEV, COMP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     REF1_SPLIT

*  Purpose:
*     Split an object path name into components.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL REF1_SPLIT( PATH, MAXLEV, NLEV, COMP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine splits an HDS object path name into its individual
*     components.

*  Arguments:
*     PATH = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The path name.
*     MAXLEV = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of components to be extracted.
*     COMP ( MAXLEV  ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The individual component names.
*     NLEV = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of components in the path name.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Inherited global status.
