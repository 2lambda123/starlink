1 JPL - JPL Ephemeris library - maintenance release
                                                   Expires: ????.??.??

 V2.0-2 Build system changed to use GNU autoconf
        + Ephemeris now installed into $STARLINK/etc rather than
          $STARLINK/etc/jpl
        + JPL helper programs now installed into $STARLINK/bin

 v2.0-1 is a maintenance release of the JPL Ephemeris and library
 which provides a slightly updated SUN/87 which has been released
 in hypertext (`showme sun87' or `findme jpl').  There are only 
 minor changes to the text of the document, and the library code 
 and datasets have not changed.
