# This script wraps a BSD-compatible install program, appending the last
# argument in a file MANIFEST.  This last argument is assumed to be
# the name of the destination file.  There are two alternative formats
# in which the last argument is the name of a directory (though these
# appear not to be used in automake-generated Makefiles in fact); in
# this case the script writes the directory name, with a trailing
# slash.
#
# This must be configured with the actual installation script.
