<!-- This DTD is designed so that each of the elements <componentset>, 
     <component> and <manifest> may be used as a top-level element.
     The intention is that each component maintains an XML file which
     is a valid instance of the <component> element; these can be
     simply concatenated into the content of a valid instance of the
     <componentset> element; and when components are installed, they
     will additionally install an XML file which is a valid instance
     of this DTD with the <manifest> element at the top level. -->

<!-- Declare the dependencies of this component on others.  These are
     of four types.

     * Sourceset dependencies are those components which must be
     installed in order to build the complete set of sources, either
     for building or for distribution.  This includes documentation,
     so it would include star2html as well as messgen.

     * Build dependencies are those which are required in order
     to build this component.  This typically means include files, but
     if part of the component is an executable file (such as compifl
     within the parsecon component), then that's a build dependence
     also (but see the discussion of `option', below).  You may not
     have two components which have a build dependency on each other,
     since that would mean that each would have to be built before the
     other, which is impossible.

     * Link dependencies are those required to link against the
     libraries in a component.  That means all the libraries that this
     component's libraries use.  These are not necessarily build
     dependencies, since if you are building a library, any called
     libraries don't have to be present in order to build this
     library; you can have two components which have mutual link
     dependencies.  If you are building an application, however, then
     all its link dependencies will actually be build dependencies and
     should be declared as such.  In other words, the distinction
     between build and link dependencies is important only for library
     components.

     * Use dependencies are those which are required in order for the
     component to be used by something else, after it has been built
     and installed.  For example a library which called another
     application as part of its functionality would have only a use
     dependency on the component which contained that application.

     The point of this is that different dependencies are required at
     different times.  The set of dependencies in the master makefile
     is composed of all the `sourceset' and `build' dependencies, but
     not `link' or `use' dependencies, and since the core Starlink
     libraries are closely interdependent, the set of `build'
     dependencies needs to be kept as small as possible in order to
     avoid circularities.

     All these relationships are transitive: if A has a build
     dependency on B, and B has one on C, then A has a build
     dependency on C.  You can augment this by using the `option'
     attribute on the elements: if, in component A's <component>
     element you say <build option='link'>B</build>, then you declare
     that A has a build-time dependency on B, but that (presumably
     because you are building an application within a component which
     is mostly libraries) you need to link against B, so component A
     has a dependency on all of B's _link_ dependencies, not just its
     build dependencies.  This is (I believe) the only case where this
     `option' attribute is useful, though it is legal on all the
     elements within <dependencies>.
