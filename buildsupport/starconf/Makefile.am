# make-starconf allows filenames to be preceded by a question mark
# '?': files which are _not_ thus prefixed are always unpacked; files
# with the `?' are unpacked only if starconf detects certain features
# in the configure.ac.
#
# Filenames preceded with `!' are always unpacked, overwriting any more
# recent file in the directory; those without are only
# unpacked if there is no file present (again, this is now an empty set).

# The edits of replacement variables (prefix and co) in
# starlink.m4.in and starconf.in must be done at `make' time rather
# than configure time (ie, not using AC_OUTPUT).  Do these by hand.
# See the `Installation Directory Variables' section of the autoconf
# manual for discussion.
#
# We substitute LN_S, DEFAULT_STARLINK... at the same time.  These
# could legitimately be done at configure time -- it does not have to
# be done this late -- but that would require us to have more than one
# substitution step, which would be too confusing and messy.
