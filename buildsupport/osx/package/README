This file describes how to create a downloadable and installable package
for the Starlink Software Collection on OS X. For more information on
distributing software for OS X, please see
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/SoftwareDistribution/SoftwareDistribution.html

1. Set the user:group of all files in the release tree to be root:wheel.
   This step may not actually be necessary if you don't set up
   PackageMaker to ask for authorization in the appropriate location.
   See http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/SoftwareDistribution/Concepts/sd_permissions_author.html
   for further information and discussion about file ownership with respect
   to Packages.

2. Run up PackageMaker. You will need the Apple Developer Tools to get
   this application, which can normally be found in
   /Developer/Applications/Utilities, and are downloadable from Apple at
   http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/ or found on your OS X 10.3
   installation CDs.

3. Load the Starlink PackageMaker project located in
   buildsupport/osx/package/StarlinkPackage.pmsp

4. Modify the appropriate information, specifically the version number and
   the directory containing Resources. The latter should be set to
   buildsupport/osx/package/Resources

5. Create the package by File > Create Package, and save it into an empty
   directory.

6. Run up Disk Utility. This is normally found in /Applications/Utilities

7. Create a new image from folder by Images > New > Image from Folder....
   Select the folder that you saved the PackageMaker package in.

You now have an OS X disk image that can be distributed.
