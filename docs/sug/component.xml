  <description>Starlink User Guide</description>
  <abstract><p>
    This is a general introduction to the Starlink Project for new
    users. You should also read the local guide for your site before
    attempting to use Starlink computers. This will tell you how to
    access your local machine and what facilities are available. As
    these documents cannot be updated very frequently, you should
    refer to the on-line files mentioned for current details of
    Starlink staff, sites, documents, and software.
