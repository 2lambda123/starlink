The documents in this tree are not associated with a particular
library or application but are standalone. They are (currently)
distributed on Starlink systems in the "docs" package and
installed into $STARLINK/docs along with other latex/html
Starlink documentation.

To minimize the number of documents in a single directory, each
document category is in its own part of the tree. The following
document categories are in use by Starlink:

 sun: Starlink User Note
   General user documentation

 sc:  Starlink Cookbook

 sg:  Starlink Guide

 sgp: Starlink General Paper
   General reports

 ssn: Starlink System Notes
   Covers technical issues

 mud: Miscellaneous User Documents
   Documents from thirdparties and other project documents
   that do not fall into the other categories.

The document labelled "sug" is a special case; it's the Starlink
User Guide and is a one off.

Each of these directories contains a directory named after the specific
number of each document. Within that directory are all the files
associated with that document (usually at least a latex file, possibly
with some associated images).

The "obsolete" directory contains documents that have been
widthdrawn either due to obsolesence (eg an old document associated
with a library that no longer exists) or irrelevance (eg documents
on porting ADAM to the unix operating system). They are retained
for historical value.
