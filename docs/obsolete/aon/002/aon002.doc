                   PLT2D - The 2D Graphics D-Task                    ______________________________ 









1. SUMMARY 



      This document describes the  operation  of  the  D-task  PLT2D.
      PLT2D is a general plotting routine for the display of 2D IMAGE
      type data and/or LINE/TEXT graphics. It was  primarily  written
      for  display  of IRCAM images on the Sigma 5688 workstation but
      can be run on ANY currently supported GKS workstation. The task                    ___                                              
      is  currently  controlled  by  a  PROCEDURE type user interface
      (C-task) which is also described below. The use of  this  tasks
      is  not  restricted  to  2D  infrared  image data and should be
      considered as a general ADAM graphics tasks  to  provide  IMAGE
      DISPLAY  and  MANIPULATION, IMAGE CONTOURING, IMAGE CUTS/SLICES
      and LINE/TEXT ANNOTATION. 





2. THE PLT2D D-TASK 




2.1 Design     ______ 

      During the design phase of PLT2D, its operation was  considered
      primarily as driving a graphics workstation. The implementation
      of the task therefore took the form of  a  D-task.  This  meant
      that  the  primitive  routines to display graphics are coded as



                                                                 AON/2                             2                             AON/2



      named ACTIONS in the ACT  subroutine  of  the  D-task  and  are
      defined  as  ACTIONs  in the task interface file. At present no
      action is performed in the D-task DEVINIT subroutine. 



2.2 Primitive OBEY actions     ______________________ 


      Below are described the current OBEY actions in PLT2D which can
      be  called  directly if needed. Operation in such a mode is not
      recommended since numerous parameters (~100)  are  called  upon
      which  may  need  setting  before  satisfactory  results can be
      obtained.

action CURCRO 
      Plots a CROSS of specified size at the CURSOR position 

action CURCUT 
      Plots a CUT (slice/profile) through an image between 
      two CURSOR positions 

action CURLIN 
      Plots a LINE between two CURSOR positions 

action CURSOR 
      Displays the CURSOR and sets position and value in 
      CURSOR_IMAGE 

action CUT 
      Plots a CUT (slice/profile) through an image from X,Y start 
      to X,Y end pixels

      PLOTS an image with scaling and manipulation 

action SETCOL 
      SETs the COLour of a pen in range 0-255 on colour workstation 






3. THE PLT2D PROCEDURE C-TASK 



      Above PLT2D exists a user interface in  the  form  of  one  (or
      more)  C-tasks  which take input from the user and instruct the
      D-task to perform its primitive operations. The current  C-task
      takes  the  form of a ADAMCL PROCEDURE. This will be eventually



                                                                 AON/2                             4                             AON/2



      re-coded as  a  FORTRAN  C-task  when  complete  debugging  has
      occurred  and  the  users  are satisfied with the operation and
      extent of the PLT2D actions. 

      Below are listed ALL the current procedures to drive PLT2D.  In
      general,  the  operation  of the procedures takes the form of a
      PROMPT for the VALUES of the parameters defining an action, the
      SETTING  of  the  parameters  and the EXECUTION of that action.
      Several procedures however allow the SETTING of values  without
      execution  of  the action, these are prefixed SET. Others allow
      the INSPECTION of the current  values  of  parameters  and  are
      prefixed GET. Also available are several one line HELP routines
      which can be listed by using the procedure ? 



3.1 Current Procedures     __________________ 


procedure ?           _ 
      Gives HELP list for PLT2D 

procedure ABORT           _____ 
      ABORT procedure for PLT2D 

procedure BLOCK           _____ 
      Asks for X,Y CENTRE, SCALE factor and ORIENTATION for a BLOCK 
      plotted on colour workstation to display colour table (LUT) 

      The X,Y CENTRE can be between the minimum and maximum X and Y 
      pixel units (raster units) for the device and on opening the 
      workstation are put in parameters MAX_XSIZE and MAX_YSIZE. 
      They can be inspected using the GETRAN procedure. 

      An example of this is : Using the ARGS the maximum pixel (raster) 
      units are 512 in both X and Y. Thus an X and Y centre of 256,500 
      would place the colour BLOCK at the centre of the screen in X and 
      close to the top of the screen in Y. 

      The SCALE factor is the number of times the size of the colour 
      table is duplicated. Thus, a colour table of 256 colours scaled by 
      a factor 2 will appear as a 10 by 512 block on the workstation. 

      The ORIENTATION of the colour block defines whether the block is 
      plotted Horizontally or Vertically (H/V) on thw workstation. 

procedure BORDER           ______ 
      Asks for the width of the border (in resolution elements) and 
      plots a BORDER of specified width around image. 

procedure BOX           ___ 
      Asks for the X,Y CENTRE and X,Y size of the BOX and plots it 
      at the specified position. 



                                                                 AON/2                             5                             AON/2



      The X,Y centre and size of the BOX are in units of the maximum 
      pixel (raster) units (see BLOCK). 

procedure BYE           ___ 
      Kills the loaded task and quits ADAMCL 

procedure CIRCLE           ______ 
      Asks for the X,Y centre and diameter of the CIRCLE and plots 
      it at the specified position. 

      The X,Y centre and diameter of the CIRCLE are in units of the 
      maximum pixel (raster) units (see BLOCK). 

procedure CLEAR           _____ 
      CLEARS the workstation of all graphics. The current colour 
      table is not affected. 

procedure CLOSE           _____ 
      CLOSES plotting on the current workstation. 

procedure COLTAB           ______ 
      Writes a COLOUR TABLE to the current workstation if it is a 
      colour device. The procedure asks for the name of the SDF file 
      containing the colour table which must be in primitive element 
      DATA_ARRAY and be of 3 by 256 elements. 

procedure COMMENT           _______ 
      Asks for the COMMENT to be plotted, the X,Y centre of the COMMENT 
      and the size of the COMMENT. It then plots the COMMENT at the 
      specified position. 

      The X,Y centre of the COMMENT are in units of the maximum 
      pixel (raster) units (see BLOCK). The size of the COMMENT is 
      the height of the characters in terms of the same units. 

procedure CONTOUR           _______ 
      Asks for the name of the image to be CONTOURed, the number of 
      contours, the base contour level, the contour interval and the 
      type of contour map drawn. The procedure then plots a contour 
      map on the current workstation. 

      The image to be contoured has to be an SDF data file with 
      primitive element DATA_ARRAY containing the image array. 
      The type of contour map drawn is defined as type 1 or type 2 
      Type 1 contour map means that ALL contours defined by the number 
      of contours, the contour base level and contour interval are 
      plotted in one scan through the data image. Type 2 contours are 
      plotted individually with the number of scans through the image 
      being equal to the number of contours drawn. 

procedure CROSS           _____ 
      Asks for the X,Y centre and size of the CROSS plotted. 




                                                                 AON/2                             6                             AON/2



      The X,Y centre and size of the CROSS are in units of the 
      maximum pixel (raster) units (see BLOCK). 

procedure CURBOX           ______ 
      Asks for the X,Y size of the BOX plotted and displays a CURSOR 
      whose position is selected by pressing any key on the input device 
      (trackerball buttons on the ARGS, any key on keyboard on TEKTRONIX) 
      The BOX is then plotted centred on the CURSOR position 

      The X,Y size of the BOX are in units of the maximum pixel (raster) 
      units (see BLOCK). 

procedure CURCIR           ______ 
      Asks for the diameter of the CIRCLE and displays a CURSOR whose 
      position will be the centre of the CIRCLE plotted. 

procedure CURCOM           ______ 
      Asks for the COMMENT word(s), and the size (see COMMENT) and 
      displays a CURSOR whose postion is the centre of the text string 

procedure CURCRO           ______ 
      Asks for the size of the CROSS to be plotted and displays a 
      CURSOR whose position is the centre of the CROSS. 

procedure CURCUT           ______ 
      Asks for the name of the image containing the data to be plotted 
      as a CUT (slice/profile) and, assuming you have an image displayed 
      on the workstation displays the CURSOR twice for the start and end 
      points of the CUT. The procedure then plots the CUT on the current 
      workstation through the cut image. This image need not be the same 
      one as currently displayed. The cut image is the one specified in 
      the CURCUT procedure while the image displayed is specified in the 
      PLOT procedure. 

procedure CURLIN           ______ 
      Displays the CURSOR twice for the start and end position in 
      screen (raster) units between which is plotted a line. 

procedure CURSOR           ______ 
      Displays the workstation CURSOR and on selection of a point using 
      the trackerball buttons/keyboard reports the X,Y pixel selected 
      in the image displayed and the value of that pixel in the 
      CURSOR image. The CURSOR image need not be the same as the image 
      displayed and can be set using the procedure SETCURIM. 

procedure CUT           ___ 
      Asks for the image from which the CUT (slice/profile) is to 
      be extracted and plotted and the X,Y start and end pixels in that 
      image. The procedure then plots the defined CUT through the cut 
      image. 

      Other CUT parameters can be SET using the procedure SETCUT 




                                                                 AON/2                             7                             AON/2



procedure DEFANN           ______ 
      This procedure informs PLT2D to plot the default annotation 
      arrangement around the current image. This option is not yet 
      complete in PLT2D and has variuos parameters defaulted in the code 
      at present. The same annotation will therefore appear regardless 
      of the image displayed. 

procedure FLASH           _____ 
      This procedure allow the user to display an image on a image 
      workstation with any pre-scaling of the image and in the centre 
      of the image area at maximum magnification so that the image fills 
      the display screen. It is therefore a FASTER image display routine 
      than PLOT but is not as flexible in its operation. The image array 
      has to be stored in an SDF type data file under the primitive 
      component DATA_ARRAY. 

procedure GETCALC           _______ 
      Procedure to GET the calculated maximum and minimum values in an 
      image that is scaled and displayed using PLOT. These values are set 
      if the values chosen for the PLT2D parameters MAXIMUM and MINIMUM 
      are equal to less than 1.0e-10. 

procedure GETCURR           _______ 
      Gets the REAL screen position of the CURSOR which will be in the 
      range 0-MAX_XSIZE and 0-MAX_YSIZE. 

procedure GETCURP           _______ 
      Gets the PIXEL position of the CURSOR with respect to the last 
      or current image displayed. The latest value of the PIXEL is 
      also returned to the user. 

procedure GETPLOT           _______ 
      Gets the IMAGE plot type. This option is SET using the SETPLOT 
      procedure and defines whether ALL (A) of the currently defined image 
      is plotted displayed or whether a SUB-IMAGE (S) of the currently 
      defined image is shown on the workstation. If the S option is in 
      operation the portion of the image plotted is defined by the 
      PLT2D parameters SUBIM_XST,SUBIM_YST and SUBI_XEN,SUBIM_YEN which 
      can be SET using the SETSUBIM procedure. Thus, if we use SETPLOT 
      to define that we want to plot a SUB_IMAGE (S) of the current image 
      then we can use SETSUBIM to set the area plotted to say, 1,1 
      32,32 and the area whose first and last pixels are 1,1 and 32,32 
      resectively will be plotted. (see also SETPLOT, SETSUBIM, PLOT 
      and CONTOUR) 

procedure GETSIZE           _______ 
      Gets the SIZE of image (in pixels) currently displayed on the 
      workstation. This defaults to 64 by 64 and is set only when the 
      image is plotted using PLOT. 

procedure GETSTEN           _______ 
      Gets the START,END coordinates (in screen units) of image 
      currently display on the workstation. 



                                                                 AON/2                             8                             AON/2



procedure GETSUBIM           ________ 
      Gets the SUB-IMAGE plot type. This procedure set whether the whole 
      (A) or a sub-image (S) of the current image is plotted when the 
      PLOT command is issued. This idea also works when plotting 
      contour maps with CONTOUR. 

procedure GETRAN           ______ 
      Gets the MAXIMUM values, in screen coordinates of the current 
      workstation. For example, the ARGS has a maximum worksation size 
      of 512 by 512 pixels, while the T4014 can address 4096 by 3120 
      pixels or resolution elements. The values returned by GETRAN 
      are these parameters. 

procedure GREY           ____ 
      This procedure writes a GREY scale colour table to the workstation 
      if it is a colour supporting device. (This is a special version 
      of COLTAB) 

procedure GRID           ____ 
      Plots a GRID of lines on an image at a specified X and Y increment 
      which may or may not be equal. the procedure asks for the values 
      of these two parameters. 

procedure HEAT           ____ 
      Writes a HEAT colour table to the current workstation if it is a 
      colour supporting device. (see COLTAB) 

procedure HELPST           ______

      Temporary HELP procedure on displaying LINE graphics using PLT2D 
      procedures. 

procedure HELPWR           ______ 
      Temporary HELP procedure on WRITING comments using PLT2D procedures. 

procedure HELPCO           ______

procedure HELPSE           ______ 
      Temporary HELP procedure on SETTING PLT2D parameter values using 
      procedures. 




                                                                 AON/2                             9                             AON/2



procedure HELPGE           ______ 
      Temporary HELP procedure on GETTING parameter values using PLT2D 
      procedures. 

procedure HELPAL           ______ 
      Temporary HELP procedure on ALL PLT2D procedures. 

procedure K           _ 
      Kills the current PLT2D task 

procedure L           _ 
      Loads PLT2D under the currently defined ALIAS 

procedure LINE           ____ 
      Asks for the start and end X,Y coordinates of a line and plots it. 

procedure OPEN           ____ 
      OPENS plotting on a specified device. Currently the device is 
      identified by its GKS workstation identifer (ARGS=1, T4010=2 etc.) 

      If the user wishes the list of currently supported workstation 
      then typing OPEN will list them and prompt for the one to use. 

      If the user does NOT wish the list of devices executing this 
      procedure as OPEN 1 or OPEN 5 for example will just do the work. 


procedure NEWDEV           ______ 
      This prcoedure allow the user to CLOSE plotting on the current 
      workstation and OPEN it on a different (or the same) one. 

procedure PENCOL           ______ 
      Asks for the pen number (0-255) and the Pen colour (W,R,B,G,Y,P, 
      C,S,N) and sets that pen to that colour immediately. 

procedure PLOT           ____ 
      This routine is the main one for PLOTTING images on a workstation. 
      It asks for the name of the image plotted only but uses several 
      other PLT2D parameters in is processing of the image before display. 

      The parameters use here are : 

      MAXIMUM, MINIMUM the range of values in the image that are 
      displayed. Above the maximum value the value plotted is placed to 
      the maximum allowable. Below the minimum the value plotted is placed 
      to the minimum allowable. These values can be set with SETMAX and 
      SETMIN. Thus if we define the MAXIMUM and MINIMUM as 4000 and 100 
      respectively for an image with a maximum and minimum value of say 
      5000 and 0 every pixel above 4000 will be displayed at the colour of 
      the top pen i.e. 255 and every pixel with a value below 100 will 
      be displayed with the colour of the 0th pen. For a GREY colour table 
      this would be WHITE and BLACK respectively. If MAXIMUM and MINIMUM 
      are equal (see GETMAX,GETMIN) then the real maximum and minimum value 



                                                                 AON/2                             10                            AON/2



      in the data image will be used as the upper and lower limits of the 
      image display. 

      IM_XCEN, IM_YCEN which are the X,and Y image centre in screen 
      coordinates (i.e. 0-512 in both X and Y for the ARGS) and are set 
      using the procedure SETCEN. If these parameters are set to 0,0 
      respectively then the image will be positioned in the centre of 
      the current workstation screen area. 

      MAGNIFICATION is a parameter defining the size of the image with 
      respect to the maximum screen coordinates when displayed on the 
      workstation. Thus a 64 by 64 image displayed at a MAGNIFICATION of 
      8 will appear as a 512 by 512 image with each REAL pixel duplicated 
      in 8x8 resolution elements. If the value set is 0 then the value 
      used for the MAGNIFICATION will be calculated to fill the current 
      workstation screen area with the current image. 

procedure PONY           ____ 
      This routine PLOTS one of the test images called PONY. This image 
      is a reduced resolution and size version of the Starlink HORSE image. 
      It is 64 by 64 pixels square and has maximum and minimum values of 
      255 and 0. 

procedure RESET           _____ 
      Procedure to RESET the current workstation. this takes the form 
      of the device being CLOSED and then OPENED again. 

procedure SETCOL           ______ 
      Asks for the type of line feature whose colour is to be set after 
      giving a list of possible types. Then asks for the colour the feature 
      is to be set to. Then the procedure sets the colour of the specified 
      feature to the specified colour. This routine does not work 
      immediately but sets the colour from the next action. 

procedure SETCEN           ______ 
      Sets the CENTRE of the coordinates for the next image to be 
      displayed. The procedure prompts the user for the X,Y centres in 
      screen coordinates. 

procedure SETCURIM           ________ 
      Sets the cursor IMAGE name. This allow the user to change the image 
      that is used to find values of pixels whose position is defined 
      by the cursor on the screen. 

procedure SETCUT           ______ 
      Sets the list of CUT (slice/profile) parameter. This list includes 
      the type of line/markers plotted in the CUT, the scaling option 
      for the plot and the position and increment of the axis tick marks 
      plotted on the CUT. 

procedure SETIM           _____ 
      Sets the IMAGE name that is displayed if the PLIT procedure is not 
      used and PLT2D is called directly via OBEYW PLT2D PLOT. 



                                                                 AON/2                             11                            AON/2



procedure SETMAG           ______ 
      Sets the MAGNIFICATION for the next image displayed. this is really 
      the duplication factor that each pixel is scaled by when plotting 
      takes place. Thus, is the MAGNIFICATION is specified as 6 then each 
      pixel in the input image is plotted as a 6 by 6 box of resolution 
      elements on the current workstation. 

procedure SETMAX           ______ 
      Sets the MAXIMUM value for image display (see PLOT) 

procedure SETMIN           ______ 
      Sets the MINIMUM value for image display (see PLOT) 

procedure SETPLOT           _______ 
      Sets the IMAGE section parameter and determines whether all or part 
      of the next image to be displayed is plotted to the workstation. 

procedure SETSUBIM           ________ 
      Sets the start and end coordinates of the SUB-IMAGE displayed if the 
      S option is chosen under SETPLOT. 

procedure SETTASK           _______ 
      Sets the NAME used when loading PLT2D with the procedure L. 
      Once this is set all subseqent procedure calls use the ALIAS name 
      for PLT2D. this is a useful facility when wanting to run PLT2D 
      on more than one device at the same time. Thus, each additional 
      version of PLT2D is called something different and controls a 
      different plotting workstation. 

procedure SPEC           ____ 
      Writes a SPECTRUM type COLOUR TABLE to the current workstation if 
      it is a colour supporting device. 

procedure TEKLINE           _______ 
      Sets the LINE type for subsequent TEKTRONIX plotting to LOCAL 
      or REMOTE. Local plotting means that the TEKTRONIX used is the 
      terminal the user is logged in at while REMOTE means that the 
      TEKTRONIX used for plotting is another terminal defined as GKS 
      unit GKS_2_1 or GKS_4_1. This facility can only be setup before 
      plotting is opened (with OPEN) on that device. 





4. USING PLT2D 



      On entry to ADAMCL the user should load the dictionary of PLT2D
      procedures  using the CL command LOADDICT ADAM_EXE:PLT2D. After
      a few seconds (at most) the CL  prompt  will  reappear  meaning
      that   the   procedures  have  been  loaded  into  the  current



                                                                 AON/2                             12                            AON/2



      dictionary. This dictionary can be inspected using the SHOWDICT
      CL  command.  Next  the  PLT2D task must be loaded into memory.
      This can be achieved by immediately using  the  L  procedure  (
      type  L <CR>) when PLT2D will be loaded under the NAME PLT2D or
      by first executing the procedure SETTASK (type SETTASK <CR>) to
      set  the  NAME  PLT2D  is  loaded  under  to something else. If
      SETTASK is executed the load procedure L must then be  run.  On
      typing L <CR> the task will be loaded and suitable messages are
      displayed on the terminal with some indication of  what  to  do
      next.  To  start plotting to some device you must open plotting
      on that workstation using the OPEN procedure (type OPEN  <CR>).
      This  will  list  the available workstations and prompt you for
      the one you want to plot  on.  At  present  the  input  of  the
      workstation  to  be  used  is  in  the  form of the workstation
      sequence number (1 for ARGS, 2 for T4010 etc.) since at present
      strings  cannot  be  compared  (for  different  actions)  in  a
      procedure. On selection of the device to be used plotting  will
      be  opened  and the plotting can proceed. The standard viewport
      used for the majority of devices is the FULL extent in  both  X
      and  Y.  Workstations  with  extended working areas such as the
      VERSATEK have a viewport set to give a X/Y ratio  of  1.5.  The
      coordinate  system  used  in  plotting is defined as merely the
      raster units in both X and Y. Thus, on the ARGS,  the  viewport
      will  be  set to 0-512 in both X and Y and the world coordinate
      system in use will  be  0-512  in  both  X  and  Y  also.  This
      unfortunately  does  mean  that at present swapping devices may
      mean changing plot parameters. A rationalization of this system
      is currently in progress. 

Once plotting is opened on the workstation any of the above procedure
to display images/line graphics can be used to produce output. 





5. ADDITIONAL ROUTINES 



      Several additional PLT2D  routines  are  being  implemented  at
      present   including   an   automatic  +3-sigma  image  dipsplay                                            _                        
      facility. 

      Users wishing to see additional routines/operations implemented
      in  PLT2D  should  address  their remarks to REVA::CAA who will
      consider and (maybe) implement them. 









                                                                 AON/2                             13                            AON/2



6. IMAGE DATA FORMAT 



      In PLT2D data to be plotted is assumed stored in an HDS  format
      data  file.  Where  2D  data is used the subroutine CMP_MAPN is
      used to map the  data  image  which  is  assumed  stored  in  a
      component  of  a  structure called DATA_ARRAY. Thus, on calling
      the image plotting action for example, the image to be  plotted
      will  be searched for under the primitive component DATA_ARRAY.
      No other component is assumed to exist at  present.  This  will
      probably  change  in  the  not  to  distant  future so that the
      routines will look for other elements in the  Starlink  'IMAGE'
      structure. 




7. TEST DATA 



      Their are several test images and colour  tables  available  to
      allow  the  user to immediately use PLT2D. At present this list
      contains PONY, a small  64  by  64  version  of  the  Horsehead
      Nebula, STARS a 64 by 64 image of a simulated random star field
      (see CREFRAME in RAPI2D) and RMON a  64  by  64  image  of  the
      bipolar reflection nebula RMON/NGC2261. Colour tables available
      include GREY, a grey scale table, HEAT, a heatcon colour  table
      and  SPEC  a  spectrum colour table. Colour tables MUST be 3 by
      256 in size (as in Starlink LUTs). Images for plotting  can  be
      any size.
