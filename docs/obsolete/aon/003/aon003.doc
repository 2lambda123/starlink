 Rapi2d - Reduction and Analysis Package for Infra-red Imaging Data  __________________________________________________________________ 








1. Overview Of Rapi2d 


  Rapi2d, a Reduction and  Analysis  Package  for  Infra-red  Imaging            _              _         _             _          _      
Data, comprises an Adam monolith containing forty individual A-tasks._                                                                    
The  package  has  been  specifically  implemented  for  use  in  the
reduction  and analysis of data taken with the common-user 1-5 micron
infra-red array camera (Ircam) currently under construction  for  the
United  Kingdom  Infra-Red  Telescope  (UKIRT),  in  Hawaii.  It  is,
however, a generalised 2-d image processing package, and is  relevant
to  any such data. There are two important points worth noting here :
firstly, Rapi2d is not at all complete, and is being released in this
preliminary  state  with the warning the current package has not been
fully tested and may contain bugs. Secondly, Rapi2d expects  to  find
data  in  an  HDS  format,  and  more  explicitly,  operates  on  the
DATA_ARRAY component of a standard IMAGE structure, found in an  .SDF
file.  The  routine  CREFRAME generates test data in this format, and
your attention is drawn to the note at the end of the following  list
for details. 

  There now follows a list of the  currently  available  routines  in
Rapi2d. 

## ADD - addition of image+image, scalar+image, scalar+scalar

             gives statistics

             number of pixels

             input image

              and y dimensions

          or vertical axis 

## GAUSS - perform a gaussian smooth on a 2-D image 

## GLITCH - replace 'bad' pixels with local mean 

## HISTEQ - performs histogram equalisation on an image 

## HISTO - calculates histogram of an image sub-array and certain 
##         statistical parameters from the histogram

## MOSAIC - merges several non-congruent images into one big image

##          user defined values both above and below limits 

## THRESH0 - for a 2-D image set all values outside a given 
             range to zero 

## TRACE - trace through the contents of a data structure

## ZAPLIN - interpolates over bad rows or columns 




2. Notes : 


CREFRAME - When running this routine, the user is prompted for a  two________                                                             
letter  string  which will define the type of test data output in the
form of an .SDF file. The options are : 

GS - Gaussian stars on a background, both with pseudo-Poisson noise 

RR - Random numbers between the limits 0 to 1 

RL - Random numbers between user-defined limits 




                                                                 AON/3.1                           4                           AON/3.1



RP - Poisson type noise on a user defined mean 

RA  -  Ramp  across  image  between  user-defined   limits   and   in
user-defined direction 

FL - Flat user-defined value over whole image 

BL - Zero across whole image 


MANIC - Has a bug that crops up  whilst  prompting  for  one  of  the_____

TRANDAT - Given a free-format text file with image data in  the  form_______                                                              
of x and y coordinate values and an intensity value in three separate
columns, this routine will create an .SDF IMAGE.
