1  SUMMARY

This release is forced by the requirement to include  the  version  of
HDS  which  is  independent  of VMS version.  The release does however
include a number of other bug  fixes  and  improvements  (notably  ICL
version  1.4)  as  detailed  below.  Applications will not, in general
need to be re-linked with this release but command language  monoliths
should be re-linked.

The full release requires about  45000  blocks  of  disk  storage  and
includes  a mini-release which can be extracted and put up separately.
The mini-release requires about 13500 blocks and allows the system  to
be run and tasks to be developed and linked.



2  INSTALLATION

Full installation instructions are given in SSN/44.4.



3  NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE

3.1  ICL

ICL Version 1.41 is  released  herewith.   ICL1.4  contains  many  new
features, summarized below.  For details, see ICLDIR:ICL014.MEM.

ICL Version 1.41 consists mainly of bug fixes  to  version  1.4.   For
details, see ICLDIR:ICL0141.MEM.

  o  Shareable Image Monoliths - An ADAM monolith can be linked  as  a
     shareable  image  and loaded by ICL into the same process as that
     running ICL.  (New command DEFSHARE).  Symbol ICLMLINK is defined
     by ADAMSTART to run the shareable monolith linking procedure.

  o  Text file input/output (New commands CREATE, OPEN, APPEND, WRITE,
     READ, READR, READI, READL, CLOSE).

  o  Screen  input/output  mode  (New  commands  SET  SCREEN/NOSCREEN,
     LOCATE,   SET  ATTRIBUTES,  CLEAR,  KEY,  KEYTRAP,  KEYUSER;  New
     functions INKEY, KEYVAL).

  o  Noticeboard system  access  (New  commands  GETNBS,  PUTNBS;  New
     function GETNBS).

  o  Logging facility similar to that in ADAMCL (New commands  REPORT,
     REPFILE, NOREP).

  o  SET SAVE/NOSAVE commands control writing of SAVE.ICL file.

  o  WAIT command causes a wait for a specified interval.

  o  RA2S, DEC2S functions format RA and DEC into strings.

  o  The document:  ICL - The New ADAM Command Language  Users  Guide,
     is updated.




3.2  SMS

SMS has been extensively updated and the User's  Note  AON/4  revised.
The main revisions are:

  o  The CLI prompt is now configurable using "cli_prompt"

  o  Prompts and "information" output are now logged

  o  The stand-alone table compiler now produces  formatted  printouts
     of  menus and parameter lists which provide hardcopy for previews
     or documentation.  Symbol COMPSCT is defined by  ADAMDEV  to  run
     the stand-alone table compiler.  See AON/4 Section 5 for details.

  o  Inline editing of parameter list items has been added

  o  An "expert user" facility has been added

  o  SMS may now be configured to provide one-line help  automatically
     as  the  cursor  is  moved  around  menu  items or parameter list
     entries

  o  The internal mechanism for SMS system configuration changes  made
     using  the keypad "COMMA" key facility has been changed.  To make
     use of this facility, new "+config+" entries are  needed  in  the
     system part of the control table.  See the example in Appendix B.

  o  Equivalences have been set up for those  using  SMS  on  a  VT220
     terminal as follows (by JHF@JACH):

                  VT100 key          VT220 key

                  ENTER              NEXT_SCREEN 
                  PF1                DO
                  PF2                INSERT_HERE
                  PF3                FIND
                  PF4                PREV_SCREEN
                  keypad "." key     SELECT 
                  "?" key            HELP 
                  "ctrl-U"           REMOVE 

                                - 3 -

  o  Help entries can include the help file name (by JHF@JACH).

  o  Continuation lines can be used within action entries.

  o  A file "include" facility has been added.




 3.3  PARAMETER SYSTEM - SUBPAR


  o  The format of displayed prompt values has  been  improved.   Some
     rounding problems may occur if prompt values are accepted.

  o  To support ICL's shareable monolith facility,  SUBPAR_PROMPT  now
     uses the ICL terminal I/O routines.  This has the added advantage
     that A-tasks run from DCL now have all the  facilities,  such  as
     command  recall  and  use of the TAB key, that are available with
     ICL.

  o  Also  to  support  shareable   monoliths,   a   new   subroutine,
     SUBPAR_ACTSHR  is  added.   This  is used to activate/re-activate
     each shareable monolith's parameter system as it is required.

  o  Improvements have been made to the  efficiency,  readability  and
     correctness    of    the    parameter    interpreting    routines
     SUBPAR_CMDLINE, SUBPAR_CMDPAR and SUBPAR_HDSIN.

  o  Logical constants in mixed case may now  be  given  as  parameter
     values.




3.4  MAG


  o  The subroutine  reference  section  of  APN/1  is  corrected  and
     improved.   Notably, UPDATE is removed as a valid access mode for
     MAG_ASSOC and MAG_OPEN, and UNLOAD is added  as  an  argument  of
     MAG_DISM.  The subroutines have not changed.

  o  A section on allocating and mounting  tapes  has  been  added  to
     APN/1.

  o  The tasks TAPEMOUNT and TAPEDISM have been added to ADAM_EXE, and
     symbols  TAPEMOUNT  and TAPEDISM defined in ADAMSTART to run them
     from  DCL.   Use  of  these  utilities  tapes   ensures   correct
     functioning of the absolute positioning system.

3.5  ADAMSHARE


  o  ADAMSHARE  now  incorporates  the  version  of   HDS   which   is
     independent  of VMS version.  Thus it can be used under version 4
     or 5 of VMS.

  o  ADAMSHARE is now linked with the VAXCRTL  object  library  rather
     than   the  shared  image.   This  prevents  some  problems  with
     duplicated subroutine  names  but  does  mean  that  applications
     containing  C  routines  may now require the VAXCRTL to be linked
     explicitly.

  o  ADAMSHARE now includes the ICL terminal  I/O  routines  including
     the  SMG screen management system.  All these additional routines
     have been added at the end of the transfer vector.




3.6  DOMAN

The automatic documentation program DOMAN has been modified to justify
'wrapped'  ends of lines with the start of the line.  Also it will now
produce documents to the Starlink standard width.

The program has been moved to a  subdirectory  of  ADAMTOOLS  and  the
system  development  login  procedure  (SYSDEV) defines a logical name
DOMAN_DIR to point to that  directory.   The  associated  DCL  command
procedures  have  also  been installed in DOMAN_DIR and SYSDEV defines
symbols to run them as follows:

   DOMAN     - Produce entries in a document library from a source file.
   PRMAN     - Produce a simple APN from a document library.
   REFPROLOG - Produce the APN header for PRMAN.
   CRMANSECT - Produce an entry in a document library from a subroutine
               source library.
   PRGUIDE   - Produce a reference manual consisting of a guide followed
               by a subroutine reference section.



3.7  DOCUMENTATION

SSN/45.6 and ARN/14 describe ADAM release 1.4.

The following documents have been re-issued:

3.8  MISCELLANEOUS

3.8.1  DEVDATASET - Magnetic tape devices  MSA0  and  MUA0  have  been
added  to  the released version of the device dataset.  DEVICE7.PRC is
altered correspondingly.



3.8.2  ADAMCL - ADAMCL_HELP and ADAMCL_FULLHELP have been enhanced  to
allow  the  library  as  well  as  the  topic  to be specified in HELP
commands.

e.g.    HELP @FILE.TOPIC




3.8.3  MSG And ERR Systems - The %parameter form  of  token  will  now
work to display the name associated with a parameter.



3.8.4  CHR - The precision used by  CHR_RTOC  and  CHR_DTOC  has  been
increased to 7 and 14 places respectively.



3.8.5  SCREEN TASK - SCREEN_FILE has  been  amended  to  increase  the
length of the filename and to open it READONLY.

3.8.6  SYSLOGNAM.COM - Instructions to define and install NBS_SHR have
been added.



3.8.7  ADAMSTART.COM - DCL  symbols  to  run  TRACE,   TAPEMOUNT   and
TAPEDISM are now defined.



3.8.8  ADAMDEV.COM - DCL symbols to run ICLMLINK and COMPSCT  are  now
defined.



3.8.9  SYSDEV.COM - DCL  symbols  ICLMLINK,  COMPSCT,  DOMAN,   PRMAN,
REFPROLOG,  CRMANSECT  and  PRGUIDE  are  now  defined.   Logical name
DOMAN_DIR is defined.  Also, via  DIR.COM,  logical  name  NBS_DIR  is
defined.

The re-definition of logical name ADAMDIR is no longer  done  so  that
the normal login procedure ADAM_DIR:GOD.PRC is obeyed.



3.8.10  HDSLINK - The stand-alone HDS program  linking  procedure  has
been modified in line with the VMS version independent HDS.



3.8.11  NBS - The Notice Board System, has been added; it is  required
by  ICL version 1.4 onwards.  NBS_DIR is defined (see SYSDEV above) to
point to the source directory but the shareable image is  copied  into
ICLDIR  (in  the mini-release section) and installed by SYSLOGNAM.COM.
If you wish to develop applications using NBS then  the  full  release
will be required and linking procedures must be worked out.



3.8.12  MESSYS VERSION 2 - The new message system (based on  MSP)  and
ADAM Networking (ANT) has not yet been included.



3.8.13  LEX - A  LEX  parameter  file  has  been  created  to  provide
symbolic  names  for  constants defining LEX states and actions.  This
parameter file has been used to improve the readability of the  SUBPAR
routines which use LEX but is not yet used by LEX itself.

4  BUGS FIXED FROM PREVIOUS RELEASE


  o  SMS  -  Bugs  in  the  routine  which   handles   SMS   parameter
     substitution  causing  integer  overflow  errors have been fixed;
     errors in parameter substitution are now reported.

  o  ADAMCL - ADAMCL_SEND  has  been  corrected  to  correctly  report
     STATUS.

  o  ERR - A bug in ERR_RLSE which caused messages  to  be  lost  when
     using the undocumented MARK and RELEASE feature is corrected.

  o  HELPSYS - A bug in HELPSYS_SETFILE has  been  corrected  so  that
     switching help libraries now operates correctly.

  o  MSP - Several bugs including a very restrictive name length  have
     been  corrected.   Note  that  MSP  is  not  yet used by the ADAM
     system.




5  CLEANUP
