1  SUMMARY

This release consists of bug fixes and some enhancements.  It has been
linked  under  VMS version 5 and is therefore not suitable for running
under VMS version 4.

Applications will not, in general, need  to  be  re-linked  with  this
release but command language monoliths should be re-linked.

The full release requires about  42000  blocks  of  disk  storage  and
includes  a mini-release which can be extracted and put up separately.
The mini-release requires about 13100 blocks and allows the system  to
be run and tasks to be developed and linked.



2  INSTALLATION

Full installation instructions are  given  in  the  Starlink  Software
Change Notice and in SSN/44.5.

A change, which may affect non-Starlink sites, has been  made  to  the
installation instructions.  See below under SYSLOGNAM.



3  NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE

3.1  DOCUMENTATION

SSN/45.7 and ARN/15.1 describe ADAM release 1.5.

The following documents have been re-issued:

  o  SSN/44.5  ADAM  -  Installation  Guide  (Converted  to  TeX   and
     updated).

  o  APN/9.3 ADAM Programmers' Guide to  the  FIO  Package  (FIO_RWIND
     added).

The following document has been added to DOCS_DIR but not to the mini-
release.

  o  ASP/8.1 Suggested improvements to the Dtask facilities




3.2  SYSLOGNAM

The section of SYSLOGNAM.COM (supplied  commented  out)  to  re-define
LNM$TEMPORARY_MAILBOX  so  that  tasks can communicate with jobs other

                                - 2 -
ARN/15.1                                                        Page 3


than  their  own,  has  been  removed  into  a   separate   procedure,
ADAM_DIR:MBLOGNAM.COM.   This means that sites will not need to change
SYSLOGNAM.COM at each release  just  to  define  LNM$TEMPORARY_MAILBOX
appropriately.   If you have not been doing this, the change will make
no difference to you.

The supplied version of MBLOGNAM.COM defines LNM$TEMPORARY_MAILBOX  as
LNM$GROUP and, if this is appropriate, it can be obeyed in addition to
SYSLOGNAM.COM at system startup; otherwise sites can  make  their  own
arrangements.



3.3  SMS


  o  SMS_LOADTABLE has been altered in the sections  producing  output
     for  printout  by  the  stand-alone  control  table  compiler  as
     follows:

      o  Include help entries in the printout.

      o  Some formats have been changed (actually to prevent crashes).


  o  Changes have been made to avoid  unnecessary  refreshing  of  the
     permanent one-line help facility.




3.4  CHR

The CHR library has been replaced by the version which will shortly be
released  as  a Starlink software item.  At that time ADAM CHR will be
removed and the Starlink version used directly.

Users of ADAM CHR should note  the  following  differences  which  may
require code changes:

  o  Subroutine CHR_STRDEC is renamed CHR_DCWRD.

  o  Subroutine CHR_LDBLNK is renamed CHR_LDBLK.

The ADAM shared image ADAMSHARE will permit either old  or  new  forms
for  a  period  to  permit  the  changes  to be made.  Some additional
routines are also available; details will appear in SUN/40.

3.5  FIO

Subroutine FIO_RWIND has been added to the library.  APN/9 is  revised
accordingly.



3.6  MSP/AZUSS

The AZUSS system services have been modified for VMS version 5 and the
MSP  shareable  image re-linked accordingly.  MSP is still not used by
ADAM.



3.7  ALINK

A modification, requested by JACH, has been made to ALINK.COM.   There
is no functional difference.



3.8  MAGLINK.OPT And FIOLINK.OPT

These link option files declare relevant common  blocks  non-shareable
to permit their use in ICL shareable monoliths.



3.9  ADAMSHARE

Entries for additional and renamed CHR routines have been added to the
end of the transfer vector.



3.10  ADAMCL

ADAMCL_KILLW will now kill when ADAM_PATH is interrupted by cntrl/C.



3.11  LOGIN PROCEDURES

The user-interface login procedures ADAM_DIR:GOD.PRC, ICLDIR:LOGIN.ICL
and ICLDIR:ADAMLOGIN.ICL are updated to display new version numbers.



3.12  SYSDEV

Logical name ATASKS is no longer defined.  Logical name SCREEN_DIR  is

                                - 4 -

no  longer  defined  by  DTASKS:DIR.COM.   It  is now set correctly by
LIB_DIR:DIR.COM to point to the directory containing the SCREEN task.



3.13  TASK Library

TASK_DONE now returns VALUE on success.



3.14  SMS UFACE

This library has been re-organized and  routines  which  are  not  SMS
specific brought into line with standard UFACE.



3.15  ICL UFACE

Routines in the ICL UFACE library which are not ICL specific have been
brought into line with standard UFACE.



3.16  TAPEMOUNT

The interface file now specifies:

      vpath  'prompt'
      ppath  'current,default'



3.17  TAPEDISM

The interface file now specifies:

      vpath  'prompt'
      ppath  'global'



4  BUGS FIXED FROM PREVIOUS RELEASE

4.1  ICL

ICL Version 1.42 was not officially released due to various  problems.
ICL  Version  1.43  is released herewith.  The following problems have
been fixed since Version 1.41.



                                - 5 -
ARN/15.1                                                        Page 6


  o  In version 1.41  new  versions  of  procedures  were  not  loaded
     following an EDIT from inside ICL.

  o  The maximum length of a statement input from the terminal was  80
     characters  and  the  ~  continuation character did not work from
     terminal  input.   In  version  1.42  statements  of  up  to  300
     characters  may  be input from the terminal (which is the maximum
     statement length allowed).  The ~ continuation character may only
     be used in LOAD file input.

  o  ADAM monoliths run using the DEFSHARE facility could  not  return
     values into ICL variables.

  o  ADAM tasks could not return values into an ICL  variable  in  the
     case  where the variable was represented by a formal parameter of
     a procedure.

  o  The bug in ICLTERMADAM which caused ADAM tasks to hang  when  run
     from DCL command procedures has been corrected.

  o  Passing a variable parameter in the form of an HDS name (so  that
     the task can return a value to ICL) is no longer used in the case
     of the OBEYW command.  It is used only for commands defined using
     DEFINE  and  DEFSHARE.   The  aim of this change is to reduce the
     likelihood of this method being used for D-tasks for which it  is
     not appropriate.

  o  An exception (HDSERR) is signalled if ICL is unable to write  the
     value  of  a variable to its HDS file for passing to an ADAM task
     (e.g.  if the file is locked by another task).

  o  When a procedure formal parameter is passed to an ADAM task it is
     passed correctly through any number of levels of procedure calls.

     E.g.

           DEFINE SQUARE SQUARE

           PROC TEST1 X
           SQUARE (X)
           END PROC

           PROC TEST2 Y
           TEST1 (Y)
           END PROC

           PROC TEST3 Z
           TEST2 (Z)
           END PROC

     The command:


                                - 6 -
ARN/15.1                                                        Page 7


           TEST3 (Q)     

     will pass the variable Q (as an HDS name)  to  SQUARE  and  allow
     SQUARE  to  return  a  value in the variable Q.  In ICL 1.42 this
     would only work through one level of procedure calls.

           TEST3 (5)

     will pass the constant value 5 (as a string) to  the  ADAM  task.
     In  ICL  1.42  the  name  of an HDS object containing the value 5
     would have been passed in this case, if the constant  was  passed
     through one or more levels of procedure calls.




4.2  SMS

A bug in routine SMS_ASTHDLR, which  caused  keystrokes  resulting  in
escape sequences to be misread on occasions, has been corrected.  (See
also "KNOWN BUGS")



4.3  UFACE


  o  UFACE_LOAD now ensures that SYS$CREPRC is always called with  the
     filename  specified  by  the user.  This overcomes a problem with
     loading privileged images.

  o  UFACE_CHECKQUOT now checks remaining page file quota and buffered
     I/O  byte  count  quota against the defaults used when creating a
     process.




4.4  SUBPAR

A bug, which  resulted  in  parameters  being  set  incorrectly  if  a
parameter  position  on  the  command  line  was  not  allocated  to a
parameter by the interface file, has been corrected.  (See also "KNOWN
BUGS")



5  CLEANUP





                                - 7 -
ARN/15.1                                                        Page 8


5.1  ITEMS REMOVED


  o  FIO/RIO - The old versions have been removed.   All  applications
     using them should have been converted.  APN/9 section 6 describes
     the differences.

  o  ICL_DIR - Various unnecessary files have been removed.

  o  DTASKS - Executable images have been  deleted  from  the  example
     Dtasks directory structure.  These were all out of date and could
     not be used anyway.

  o  CAM_DIR - CAMSUBM.LIS has been deleted to save 747 blocks.

  o  COPY procedures - The procedures in ADAMEXE_DIR which  were  used
     to  update  the  'executables' directory in the mini-release have
     been removed.  The process  is  now  carried  out  by  the  BUILD
     procedures in ADAM_ADAMEXE.




5.2  CANDIDATES FOR REMOVAL

5.2.1  CHR - Note that it is proposed to delete the ADAM  CHR  library
at  the  next  release.   By  that time the Starlink version should be
released.  Note also that the option to use the old  subroutine  names
will probably be withdrawn at the same time.



5.2.2  TEL - The TEL library of UKIRT utilities seems rather  specific
to  be part of the released system.  Are there any objections to their
removal from the release?



5.2.3  CLITASK - There is a bug in CLITASK (ADAMCL running as a  task)
which  means  that  it  has not worked for some time.  As this has not
been reported,  presumably  nobody  is  using  it.   Is  it  a  useful
facility?



6  KNOWN BUGS


  o  SMS - If  keys  producing  escape  sequences  are  hit  in  rapid
     succession, later ones may be misread.



                                - 8 -
ARN/15.1                                                        Page 9


  o  Arrays in interface files  -  Arrays  specified  as  defaults  in
     interface files must be enclosed in parentheses.  Square brackets
     (the normal parameter system syntax) are not accepted.

  o  Parameter POSITION Fields  -  AED/3  says  that  every  parameter
     should  be  allocated  a  position.   The  interface file parsing
     permits  POSITION  fields  to  be  omitted.   It  should  not  be
     necessary to define a position for every parameter, especially if
     there are a large number of them, but it must  be  a  mistake  to
     have  non- contiguous positions allocated.  A fix in this release
     means that if  parameter  position  N  is  unallocated,  the  Nth
     non-keyword parameter on the command line will be ignored.

  o  Figaro - cannot be run from  ICL  unless  the  following  logical
     names  are defined:  FIGSHR, BIGFIG, FGRSHR, TVPSHR.  They should
     point to shared images in FIGARO_PROG_S.

  o  HDS - There is a bug which causes a crash if an attempt  is  made
     to create a file smaller than the disk cluster size.

  o  CLITASK - Reports PAR-I-NOUSR if an attempt is made to use it.
