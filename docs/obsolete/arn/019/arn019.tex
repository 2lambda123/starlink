\section{SUMMARY}
This is a partial release of ADAM to update Version 1.9 with fixes for two 
bugs in the parameter system, and some other minor changes.
This release note also documents corrections to the SGS and GKS include files
which were issued in SSC495A.
It will not be necessary to re-link tasks for this release.

\section{INSTALLATION}
Full installation instructions are given in the Starlink Software 
Change Notice.

\section{NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE}


\subsection{ADAMSTART}
ADAMSTART.COM is modified to display the latest ADAM version number
and to revise the definition of the DCL symbol, TRACE (see below).

\subsection{TRACE}
The TRACE utility will shortly be released in a new, improved form as
a separate Starlink software item.
ADAMSTART and the standard ICL startup procedures will point to the new 
version.
The version currently distributed with ADAM will be removed in a future
release.
As an interim measure, ADAMSTART will define symbol TRACE to run the new version
if that version is installed; otherwise it will run the original version.

\subsection{Documentation}
ARN/19-1.1 describes ADAM release 1.9-1.
There is no corresponding SSN/45.

The summaries, ADAM\_DOCS:0CONTENTS.LIS, FULLDOCS.LIS and NEWDOCS.LIS, have 
been updated. 

\section{BUGS FIXED}

\subsection{Parameter System}
The following bugs in SUBPAR have been fixed.
\begin{itemize}
\item A bug which caused global parameters not to be updated at the end of a 
task and may have caused other problems associated with HDS object names.
(SUB\-PAR\_\-SPLIT)
\item A bug which caused the wrong parameter to be given a value if the
value corresponded with the keyword of a parameter not required for a
particular action in a D-task.
The system now checks that any logical keyword specified on the command
line is for a parameter which is required by the action and has not already
been set by position.
If it is not, the normal process for resolving ambiguous items will continue.
It is assumed that all specified parameters are required by the A-task action.
(SUB\-PAR\_\-CMD\-LINE) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SGS and GKS Include Files}
The SGS and GKS Fortran include files were not updated in ADAM\_INC in line 
with the source directories. In particular the names were changed from
SGS/GKSERR.FOR to SGS/GKS\_ERR.FOR

\subsection{MESSYS Version 2}
The procedures {\em etc.} for creating the shareable images using the
MSP-based version of the inter-task message system, are brought into line
with the Version 1 system.
It is hoped to release the Version 2 system in the near future. 

{\em This is expected to coincide with other changes which will require all 
tasks to be re-linked.}
