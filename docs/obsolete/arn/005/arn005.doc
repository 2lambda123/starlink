                      ADAM Software Release 0.6                       _________________________ 







1. SUMMARY 


This release is a minor update to version 0.5,  and  is  arranged  so
that only changed items are included, rather than a copy of the whole
system. The reason for this is that  it  enables  the  update  to  be
distributed by network rather than magtape. 





























                                                                 ARN/5.1                           2                           ARN/5.1

3. INTRODUCTION 


The overall ADAM directory structure is the same as that  in  release
0.0;  for  details refer to ARN/2.  Further logical names and symbols
have been added. 

Note that in this, as in all releases, the  logical  name  "ADAM_DIR"
must  be set up correctly in the "DEVLOGIN.COM" file in the top level
directory;  all sub-directories are defined relative to this one. 




4. NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE 




4.1 Organisation     ____________ 

The release consists of three files:- 

DEVLOGIN.COM - to set-up the initial logical names 

VER06.BCK - save-set containing the new source code 

VER06.COM - command file which performs the update 

It is necessary to put these three  files  into  the  top-level  ADAM
directory, where DEVLOGIN.COM will replace its previous version. Also
ensure that this  directory  does  not  have  a  subdirectory  called
[.UPDATE]  as  this  name  is  used  by  the V0.6 update procedure as
temporary storage. 





                                                                 ARN/5.1                           3                           ARN/5.1



Then 

Edit DEVLOGIN.COM so that the physical name  of  the  top-level  ADAM
directory is named correctly. 

@VER06 then causes VER06.BCK to be expanded into [.UPDATE...]*.*  and
puts   files  into  the  relevant  ADAM  directories  and  libraries,
compiling   them   where   necessary.   It   finishes   by   deleting
[.UPDATE...]*.*. 

It is now necessary to regenerate the shareable image. This  is  done
by 

SET DEF LIB_DIR 

@ADAMSHARE 

As the shareable image is large, the person  doing  the  installation
might  prefer  to delete the previous ADAMSHARE.EXE before generating
the new one, if disk-space is limited. 

After replacing the shareable image it is necessary  to  re-link  all
A-tasks and D-tasks. 

The ADAM command-language can be re-linked by 

SET DEF CLI_DIR 

@ADAMCLINK 


4.2 Linking     _______ 

The commands ALINK and DLINK are used to  produce  A-  and  D-  tasks
linked  with the shareable image. ALINK uses the 'CH' tool, which was
accidentally omitted from V0.5, but is included here. 


4.3 Parameter System     ________________ 

The routines for setting-up dynamic defaults have  been  implemented.
These are: 

DAT_DEF - provide HDS structure as a dynamic default 

PAR_DEF0<T> - set scalar dynamic default 

PAR_DEF1<T> - set vector dynamic default 

PAR_DEFN<T> - set array dynamic default. 

Where <T> is in turn CDILR for the various data types. 




                                                                 ARN/5.1                           4                           ARN/5.1



5. STILL MISSING FROM THIS RELEASE 


The following list is not complete but indicates  major  areas  where
some  action  might  be  expected  soon.   In particular, the work on
networking has started, and initial work on graphics will start soon.

Major items missing: 
Graphics packages 
Networking 




6. BUGS FIXED FROM PREVIOUS RELEASE 


Dtasks exiting under a  variety  of  error  conditions,  rather  than
reporting the error and continuing to run. 

ADAMCL  failing  to  do  default  declaration  of  numeric  variables
correctly. 

HDS names given on a command-line not being set-up correctly. 

Using SET  on  a  D-task  parameter  (ie.  a  parameter  declared  as
INTERNAL)  with  the  value  having the syntax of an HDS name made it
impossible  to  revert  to  setting  a  scalar  into   the   internal
common-blocks for the parameter. This meant that if one did: 

SEND JUNK > SET PAR1 VALUE 

when 

SEND JUNK > SET PAR1 'VALUE' 

was meant, the parameter system would assume that VALUE was the  name
of  an HDS structure into which values of PAR1 were to be put, and it
was impossible to escape from  this  condition  without  killing  the
task. 




7. KNOWN BUGS 


These are the most important bugs found that can potentially  produce
unwanted  effects and may cause confusion.  Please let us know of any
unusual behaviour of the system ! 

(1) At present, any task can open channels to  other  tasks  no  more
than 20 times. 



                                                                 ARN/5.1                           5                           ARN/5.1



(2) When the "engineering interface" is started up, it can be  "hung"
completely by typing something before the prompt appears. (Get out of
this with ctrl-Y.) 

(3) If the command "SPAWN" is used in the Adam command language,  two
carriage  returns  are  needed  to  obtain the DCL "$" prompt.  After
logout  from  the  spawned  subprocess,  the  extra  carriage  return
reappears as a blank command line. 

(4) If a number of SEND commands are issued within a command language
loop,  action  stops  after  the first few until a carriage return is
typed. Sometimes the terminal receives a non-printable  character  at
this point. 

(5) The CANCEL context does not always work correctly.  Sometimes  an
action  can  be  reported  to  have been cancelled, but the timer for
rescheduling may not be cancelled and the action re-starts  when  the
timer expires. 

(6) CALL ADAM_SEND in a C-task returns  as  soon  as  it  receives  a
message  from  another  task,  rather than insisting on receiving the
acknowledgement to the message just sent.
