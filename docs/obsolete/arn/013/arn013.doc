1  SUMMARY

This release consists mainly of bug corrections and a major tidying up
exercise.   The  GKS6.2  version of the system has been removed and so
have items of software distributed separately by Starlink.

The full release requires about  45000  blocks  of  disk  storage  and
includes  a mini-release which can be extracted and put up separately.
The mini-release requires about 13000 blocks and allows the system  to
be run and tasks to be developed and linked.

The FIO/RIO facilities are  officially  released  with  this  version.
Applications  using  old versions of FIO/RIO should be modified to use
the official release.

It will not in general be necessary  to  re-link  tasks  to  use  this
release.



2  INSTALLATION

Full installation and  testing  instructions  are  given  in  Starlink
System  Note  SSN/44.   Note  that  these  instructions  have  changed
considerably with this release and should be followed from scratch.



3  NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE

3.1  Structure And Contents

In  order  to  save  disk  space  and  to  rationalize  the  directory
structure, the following things have been done:

  o  ADAM on Starlink is now installed in a top level directory.   The
     same  directory  tree  may  be used to install either the full or
     mini release.

  o  The  applications  directory  has  been  removed  from  the  ADAM
     directory  tree.   This enables the system and applications to be
     treated separately and one level of the hierarchy to be removed.

  o  Numerous old and temporary files  have  been  deleted.   In  some
     cases  it  was not clear if the files were being used by anybody.
     If any files vital to your work have been removed, please  inform
     RLVAD::AJC.   The  intention is that development work is not done
     within the ADAM directory structure so that the release  is  kept
     free from junk.

  o  Libraries have been compressed  and  reduced.   Object  libraries
     needed for applications development have not been reduced.

  o  GKS6.2 versions, are no longer included.

  o  EXE  files  in  the  mini-release  are  not  duplicated  in   the
     development levels of the full release.

  o  The ADAMSHARE options file has been replaced by ADAMSHRLIB in all
     link procedures.




3.2  Starlink Software

To avoid  the  many  problems  associated  with  duplicate  copies  of
software,  items  which  are  distributed  separately  by Starlink are
omitted from this release apart from  being  included  in  the  shared
images.   An exception to this rule is that copies of relevant Fortran
INCLUDE files will be contained in  ADAM_INC  as  before.   This  will
enable  ADAM  tasks  to  be developed and run without the necessity to
install other Starlink software apart from GKS7.2 if graphics is used.

Some items remain to be organized in this  fashion;  notably  ADC  and
FIO/RIO distributed with SCAR.

The software items used by ADAM but no longer included in the  release
are:

   GKS7.2
   SGS
   HDS
   DAT
   CMP
   ARGSLIB
   LIBMAINT
   GENERIC

Note that environment level routines (x_ASSOC, x_CANCL etc.) for these
packages do still form part of the ADAM release.



3.3  Software Items Withdrawn

The following items which are not distributed by Starlink are also  no
longer distributed with ADAM:

   GEN
   AUTODOC

3.4  SMS


  o  Output Message Prefix - The taskname  prefix  on  output  may  be
     switched off.

  o  Prompt - The command language prompt may be altered.

  o  Documentation - An updated version of  AON/4  describes  the  new
     features.




3.5  ICL


  o  ICL - ICL, and the object libraries necessary for linking it, are
     included in this release.  Not all the source code is included.

  o  Login files - The installation instructions  will  cause  ICL  to
     obey ICLDIR:LOGIN.ICL on startup unless ADAMSTART has been obeyed
     in which case ICL will  obey  ICLDIR:ADAMLOGIN.ICL.   The  former
     will  warn  that ADAM tasks are not available and the latter will
     define procedures to invoke the major applications packages.

  o  ICL/SMS - A version of SMS using ICL as the command  language  is
     available.  To invoke it, type:

     $ SMSICL


  o  Documentation - The .TEX and .TOC files for "ICL - The  New  ADAM
     Command Language Users Guide" are included in ICLDIR.




3.6  Parameter System


  o  Global ppath - A global parameter value may be used as the prompt
     value by including 'global' in the ppath specification.

  o  Case Insensitivity - The parameter system is now case-insensitive
     for  RANGE  and  IN  and  for  the  NOkeyword  form  for  logical
     parameters on the command line.

      o  AED/3 'Interface Module Reference Manual' has been updated.

      o  APN/6 'The PAR Library' has been updated.  PAR_STATE  is  now
         documented and the descriptions of all routines improved.


  o  Parameter and  Action  Names  -  Any  constant  may  be  a  valid
     parameter or action name.

  o  Syntax -  The  parameter  system  will  now  distinguish  between
     directory specifications and arrays.




3.7  FIO/RIO

The FIO and RIO facilities for file IO are included  in  the  release.
They  are  based on the versions which have been used in SCAR, but the
subroutine interface has been rationalized so that there is  now  only
one  subroutine  to  open  files  for  each  facility  package.  APN/9
describes the package.

The directory structure (with logical names in parentheses) is:

                                    |
                         [ADAM.LIB.FIO]  (FIO_ENV)
                          The environment level
                                    |
                   ---------------------------------
                   |                               |
       [ADAM.LIB.FIO.STD] (FIO_DIR)        [ADAM.LIB.FIO.TEST]
          The stand-alone level              FIO test program

There is a similar structure for RIO.



3.8  HDS/DAT


  o  DAT_EXIST on protected  files  -  DAT_EXIST  will  now  return  a
     suitable error if the file exists but is protected.

  o  Documentation  -  APN/8  has   been   withdrawn   as   definitive
     descriptions of the DAT utility routines are given in SUN/92.

3.9  Task Loading


  o  ASTLM - When a task is loaded, it now is given the same ASTLM  as
     the process running the user interface.
     Subroutines altered are:
        UFACE_LOAD
        UFACE_LOADD
        UFACE_CHECKQUOT

  o  Insufficient Subprocess Quota -  If  the  user  has  insufficient
     subprocess  quota  when  attempting  to load a cached task, it is
     treated like 'cache full'.  I.e.  the task at  the  head  of  the
     queue is killed.
     Subroutines altered are:
        ADAMCL_PUTTASK
        ADAMCL_OPTLOAD
        ADAMCL_CACHE   (new subroutine)
        ADAMCL_PRCCNT  (new subroutine)




3.10  Error Messages


  o  Inclusion in shared image - All known error message modules  have
     been  included in the shared image ADAMSHARE so that they will be
     readily available for user interfaces as  well  as  tasks.   Link
     options files have been altered appropriately.

  o  ERRGEN - The ERRGEN utility has been  re-implemented  in  Fortran
     and now outputs standard F77 code.

3.12  REF

The REF facility  for  handling  references  to  HDS  objects  is  not
included   in  the  shared  image  and  must  therefore  be  installed
separately if it is to  be  used.   REF  error  messages  are  however
included in ADAMSHARE and are therefore known to the user interfaces.

REF is described in SUN/31.

  o  Slice syntax only  works  if  there  is  a  preceding  ":"  (i.e.
     JUNK:DATA(3:5) OK, DATA(3:5) fails.

  o  SUBPAR_HDSOPEN Correct case of filename containing array  element
     information.




4.2  User Interfaces


  o  Long command lines crash ADAMCL.

  o  IFL for HDSCREATE in ACL has file declared  as  READ  instead  of
     WRITE.

5  KNOWN BUGS

These are the most important bugs found that can  potentially  produce
unwanted  effects  and may cause confusion.  Please let us know of any
unusual behaviour of the system !

  o  At present, any task can have channels open to no  more  than  20
     other  tasks  simultaneously.  (This is a 'feature' rather than a
     bug).

  o  If a number of SEND <task> OBEY  commands  are  issued  within  a
     command  language  loop,  the message system fills with the final
     acknowledgements.  The cure is to avoid SEND  <task>  OBEY  in  a
     loop by using OBEYW instead.

  o  The RPATH field in the IFL is not yet implemented.

  o  In Dtasks, array parameters with their  literal  list  of  values
     defaulted in the IFL must not be put on a NEEDS list.

  o  ADAMCL will hang if $EXIT or $STOP is issued.

                              APPENDIX A

                    ADAM - UPDATE 1 TO VERSION 1.3



A.1  BUGS FIXED FROM PREVIOUS RELEASE

A.1.1  Command Language Startup Procedures

The command language startup  procedures  GOD.PRC  and  OTHER.PRC  are
corrected  to  simplify  access to KAPPA.  The date in GOD.PRC is also
updated to indicate that this release has been implemented.



A.1.2  FIO

The prologue comments  of  FIO_ASSOC  are  corrected  to  include  the
argument FORM in the invocation.



A.1.3  Parameter System


  o  A  bug  in  SUBPAR_GETxy  and  SUBPAR_PUTxy  routines  has   been
     corrected.  The bug caused corruption of HDS locators when a null
     or abort response was given to a prompt.

  o  The checks in SUBPAR_CHECKNAME have been relaxed to allow  object
     names of the form "file_specification".




A.1.4  Adamcl

ADAMCL_GETDEF has been corrected to prevent a bug which caused  Adamcl
commands  such  as  ASKCHOICE  to reject default values given in lower
case.  ADAMCL, ACL, CLITASK and SMS have been re-linked to include the
correction.   Any  private  command  language monoliths should also be
re-linked.

A.2  DOCUMENTATION


  o  APN/9 is re-issued to correct the specification of FIO_ASSOC.

  o  SSN/45 and ARN/13 have  been  re-issued  to  include  Appendix  1
     describing the first update to ADAM version 1.3.  There is also a
     correction to Section 5, point 5 of the main document.




A.3  SYSDEV

The system development login procedure SYSDEV.COM has been altered  as
follows:

  o  ADAM_EXE and ADAM_HELP are not re-defined.  They remain  pointing
     at  the  mini-release  directories  as  .EXE  files are no longer
     duplicated in other parts of the directory structure.

  o  LIB_DIR:SYMBOL.COM is no longer called to re-define  symbols  for
     system development.  LIB_DIR:SYMBOL.COM is still provided but can
     only be used if all the required .EXE files are restored  to  the
     system source directories.  Symbol EDEN is no longer defined.

  o  Symbols required for application development are defined  as  for
     ADAMDEV  but  logical  names  A_DIR  and  D_DIR will point to the
     system source directories.

  o  Logical names for include files will point to the  system  source
     directories.

  o  Symbols ANOSHR, DNOSHR,  CDNOSHR  and  MNOSHR  are  provided  for
     linking A, D, C(d) tasks and monoliths with libraries rather than
     shared images.




A.4  STRUCTURE


  o  The SUBPAR library has been re-organized so that  only  the  .GEN
     versions  of  generic routines are kept in the text library.  The
     GENERIC feature of LIBMAINT is used to automatically produce  the
     required  object  modules.   This saves almost 700 blocks of disk
     space and simplifies updates.

  o  The disk space requirement for the full release of ADAM has  been
     reduced to about 41100 blocks.
