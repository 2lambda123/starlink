                      ADAM Software Release 0.8                       _________________________ 







1. SUMMARY 


This is a major release (via magtape) and is rather  large  (25  Mb).
The reason for this is that it includes the graphics packages as well
as the full system and a number of application programs. 

Any local application programs need re-linking. 

The SYSTEM logical names (formerly GROUP) have  been  collected  into
[ADAM.COM]SYSLOGNAM.COM.  It  is  suggested that a command to execute
this file (after editing the directory names) should be put into  the
VMS startup. 























                                                                 ARN/7.1                           2                           ARN/7.1

3. INTRODUCTION 


The overall ADAM directory structure is the same as that  in  release
0.0;  for  details refer to ARN/2.  Further logical names and symbols
have been added. 

Note that in this, as in all releases, the  logical  name  "ADAM_DIR"
must  be set up correctly in the "DEVLOGIN.COM" file in the top level
directory;  all sub-directories are defined relative to this one. 




4. NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE 




4.1 Organisation     ____________ 

The release consists of a BACKUP save set on magtape. The command  to
generate it was : $ BACKUP [ADAM...]*.*;* MT:ADAM08.BCK 



4.2 Linking     _______ 

The commands ALINK, DLINK and GLINK are used to  produce  A-  and  D-
tasks and A-tasks which do graphics linked with the shareable image. 





                                                                 ARN/7.1                           3                           ARN/7.1



4.3 Task Loading     ____________ 

On being loaded, a task now expects to find its IFL  or  IFC  in  the
same  directory as the file containing the execution module. The task
first looks for an IFC, and if this is not found,  it  looks  for  an
IFL. 


4.4 Parameter System     ________________ 

DAT_ASSOC, DAT_EXIST and DAT_CREAT now handle  the  cases  where  the
user  has typed an HDS name which includes a component of a structure
array. 


4.5 ADAMENG     _______ 

The engineering interface no longer attempts to spawn a  DCL  command
whenever  it  receives  an unrecognised command. To give a command to
DCL the command should be prefixed by a $. 


4.6 SMS     ___ 

The Screen Management System now displays information messages coming
back  from  tasks in a scrolling region, and also handles prompts for
A-task parameters. 


4.7 ADAMCL     ______ 

The ADAMCL terminal handling has been  changed,  and  now  intercepts
control-C.  If  control-C  is  typed  as  a  'command',  then this is
interpreted as ABORT. The user should  provide  an  ADAMCL  procedure
called  ABORT  to make use of this facility. If control-C is typed in
response to a parameter prompt, then "!!" is returned  to  the  task,
causing  a  PAR__ABORT  status.  If control-C is typed while OBEYW is
being executed, the user escapes back to the command prompt. 

The ADAMCL task loading has been changed, so that if the task is  not
found  in the current directory (assuming no directory was specified)
then it is looked for in the directory with logical name ADAM_EXE. 

The following new commands have been added to ADAMCL. 

   [square brackets means the parameter is optional] 

ABORT 

This does nothing. It is automatically called when ctrl-C  is  typed.
The  intention  is that the observer should define a procedure called
ABORT which responds to ctrl_C. 




                                                                 ARN/7.1                           4                           ARN/7.1



GET taskname parameter_name [variable_name] 

Get the value of the named parameter from the named task and  put  it
into  the  ADAMCL  variable called variable_name. If variable_name is
missing from the command, it defaults to parameter_name. If an ADAMCL
variable  of  the  correct name does not exist, then if the value got
has the syntax of a number, a real variable will be created to  store
it. 

LOADW exename [taskname] 

Load the named task and wait for loading to be complete. 

SETRA [right_ascension] 

Convert HH MM SS.S into a real number and  store  it  in  the  ADAMCL
variable  RA_INPUT.  If  the  value is not given on the command line,
prompt for it. 

SETDEC [declination] 

Convert DD MM SS.S into a real number and  store  it  in  the  ADAMCL
variable  DEC_INPUT.  If  the value is not given on the command line,
prompt for it. 

ASKCHAR variable_name [prompt_string] 

Prompt  the  user  for  input  using  the  given  prompt  string.  If
prompt_string  is  not specified, use variable_name as the prompt. If
the user's reply is not inside single quotes,  add  them.  Store  the
result  in the ADAMCL variable variable_name. Note that variable_name
must have been previously declared. 

ASKNAME variable_name [prompt_string] 

As ASKCHAR, but don't add surrounding quotes. 

ASKNUM variable_name [prompt_string] 

Prompt  the  user  for  input  using  the  given  prompt  string.  If
prompt_string  is  not  specified,  use  variable_name as the prompt.
Interpret the response as  a  number  and  store  it  in  the  ADAMCL
variable variable_name. If the variable hasn't been declared already,
it will be created. 

ASKDEC variable_name [prompt_string] 

Prompt  the  user  for  input  using  the  given  prompt  string.  If
prompt_string  is  not  specified,  use  variable_name as the prompt.
Interpret the response as DD MM SS.S, convert it to a real number and
store it in the ADAMCL variable variable_name. If the variable hasn't
been declared already, it will be created. 




                                                                 ARN/7.1                           5                           ARN/7.1



ASKRA variable_name [prompt_string] 

Prompt  the  user  for  input  using  the  given  prompt  string.  If
prompt_string  is  not  specified,  use  variable_name as the prompt.
Interpret the response as HH MM SS.S, convert it to a real number and
store it in the ADAMCL variable variable_name. If the variable hasn't
been declared already, it will be created. 

OBEYW string 

Interpret  string  as  a  possible  list  of  ADAMCL   variables   or
expressions. After any relevant translations, interpret the result as

task_name action_name [parameters] 

Then perform 

   SEND task_name OBEY action_name parameters 

and wait for the final acknowledgement. If  parameter  requests  come
from  the  task,  handle  them  by prompting the user, then return to
waiting for the final acknowledgement. 

INIT_TIMER 

Initialise the VMS timer. This calls the VMS runtime library  routine
LIB$INIT_TIMER. 

SHOW_TIMER 

Display the VMS timer. This calls the  VMS  runtime  library  routine
LIB$SHOW_TIMER. 

REPORT 

Cause copies of all commands and error messages to be  written  to  a
file  called  <process_name>.REP.  The file is a text file and can be
TYPED. This also  provides  a  mechanism  for  retaining  a  copy  of
procedures which have been typed directly into ADAMCL. 

NOREP 

Switches reporting off. 




5. STILL MISSING FROM THIS RELEASE 


The following list is not complete but indicates  major  areas  where
some action might be expected soon. 




                                                                 ARN/7.1                           6                           ARN/7.1



Major items missing: 
Networking 
Data analysis mode 




6. BUGS FIXED FROM PREVIOUS RELEASE 


(1) The ADAMCL SPAWN command no longer  requires  an  extra  carriage
return. 

(2) Dtask actions 'reinventing' themselves under  some  circumstances
when  AST  routines  or  reschedules  are involved and the action has
either completed or been cancelled, is believed to have been cured. 

(3) ADAMCL is no longer liable to hang-up  if  the  user  types-ahead
while it is starting up. 

(4) ADAM_PATH now returns status ok if the path was already open. 

(5) A variety of problems with global associations have been fixed. 

(6) It was formerly not possible to do a PAR_GET after having done  a
PAR_PUT on the same parameter. 

(7) In ADAMCL, if a procedure failed because of an  error  condition,
its stack space was not recovered. 



7. KNOWN BUGS 


These are the most important bugs found that can potentially  produce
unwanted  effects and may cause confusion.  Please let us know of any
unusual behaviour of the system ! 

(1) At present, any task can have channels open to no  more  than  20
other tasks simultaneously. 

(2) When the "engineering interface" is started up, it can be  "hung"
completely by typing something before the prompt appears. (Get out of
this with ctrl-Y.) 

(3) If a number of SEND <task> OBEY  commands  are  issued  within  a
command  language  loop,  the  message  system  fills  with the final
acknowledgements. The cure is to avoid SEND <task> OBEY in a loop  by
using OBEYW instead. 

(4) Incomplete implementation of VPATH 'CURRENT'. See ARN6. 




                                                                 ARN/7.1                           7                           ARN/7.1



(5) The RPATH field in the IFL is not yet implemented. 

(6) DIA_ASSOC and DIA_ANNUL appear to work satisfactorily  the  first
time  an  A-task is run, but give GKS errors the second time the task
is run.
