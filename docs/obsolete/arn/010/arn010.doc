                      ADAM Software Release 1.0                       _________________________ 







1. SUMMARY 


This is a major release (via magtape) and is rather  large  (25  Mb).
The reason for this is that it includes the graphics packages as well
as the full system and a number of application programs. 

It also includes a mini-release which can be  extracted  and  put  up
separately.  It  takes  up  about  3Mb  of disk space, and allows the
system to be run and tasks to be developed and linked. 

***WARNING 

Any local application programs need re-linking  and  interface  files
need  recompiling.  Dtask  subroutines  which  include  DTDEFNS  need
recompiling. 

The SYSTEM logical names (formerly GROUP) have  been  collected  into
[ADAM.COM]SYSLOGNAM.COM.  It  is  suggested that a command to execute
this file should be put into the VMS startup following a  command  to
define  the  SYSTEM  logical  name ADAM_DIR to point to the top-level
ADAM directory. 














                                                                 ARN/10.1                          2                          ARN/10.1

4. UTILITY PROGRAMS RUN FROM DCL 


There are a set of DCL commands which have  been  defined  to  enable
certain utilities to be run from DCL. These are 

KILLTASK - kill an ADAM task 





                                                                 ARN/10.1                          3                          ARN/10.1



COMPIFL - compile an interface module 

ADDHELP - put help information into an ADAM help file 

HELPDUMP - write the contents of an ADAM help file into a text file 

STARTUP - create ADAM_USER:GLOBAL.SDF 



5. NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE 




5.1 Organisation     ____________ 

The release consists of a BACKUP save set on magtape. The command  to
generate it was : $ BACKUP [ADAM...]*.*;* MT:ADAM10.BCK 


5.2 Linking     _______ 

The commands ALINK and  DLINK are used to produce A-  and  D-  tasks.
MLINK  links  a  set  of  'A-tasks' into a monolith. DCAMLINK links a
Dtask with the CAMAC library. CDLINK links a CD-task. DCL_ALINK links
an  Atask  which  is  to  run  directly  at the terminal and is to be
started by the DCL RUN command. 


5.3 Task Loading     ____________ 

On being loaded, a task expects to find its IFL or IFC  in  the  same
directory as the file containing the execution module. The task first
looks for an IFC, and if this is not found, it looks for an IFL. 


5.4 DCL-Atasks     __________ 

It is now possible to link an A-task into a .EXE which is to  be  run
from  DCL  rather  than from an ADAM user interface. This is valuable
for program development, where the typical sequence of operations  is
EDIT,  FORT,  LINK,  RUN, and for interactive graphics programs where
the command terminal is the graphics device. 


5.5 MON     ___ 

The monitor system has  been  extensively  modified.  Its  subroutine
interface  is  now  organised  on  'generic' lines, so that there are
routines 
MON_GET0<t> 
MON_PUT0<t> 



                                                                 ARN/10.1                          4                          ARN/10.1



MON_GET1<t> 
MON_PUT1<t> 
where <t> is one of C,D,L,I,R. The maximum size of vector handled has
increased considerably to 65536 bytes. See AED9. 


5.6 Logging     _______ 

A mulititasking logging facility is provided. This is  documented  in
AED10.   The   ADAM   log  file  produced  is  an  indexed-sequential
unformatted file, each record being time-stamped with the VMS  system
time.  Records  can  be  written  to the log file by any task without
concurrent access problems  by  using  the  LOG  library.  This  also
provides routines for reading the log file and so producing output as
text or for a remote observer. 

The LOG facility is not built into the  shareable  image,  so  it  is
necessary to use (for example): 
$ ALINK JUNK,LOG_DIR:LOG/LIB,LOCK_DIR:LOCK/LIB 
The LOCK library is used by LOG, and is a simple wrap-around for  the
VMS lock manager. 


5.7 HELPSYS     _______ 

The ADAM HELPSYS library is described in AED4 and AED5.  In  summary,
subroutines  are  provided  to  select  a  help  file  and to extract
information from it. The help files are HDS files. They are generated
from  a  text  source  compatible  with  VMS  HELP,  but  with  extra
conventions added. The command ADDHELP processes the text source  and
stores  it  in  HDS. It is suggested that each observing mode or data
analysis mode should have its own help file. ADAMCL and  SMS  provide
commands for accessing and displaying the contents of help files. 


5.8 Graphics     ________ 

The low-level graphics system is still GKS 6.2. Work is proceeding at
RAL  to  provide GKS 7.2 for ADAM. Provision will have to be made for
this update in due course. 

DIAGRAM has  been  updated  to  correspond  to  the  latest  Starlink
version. This includes a contouring facility. 

ARGSLIB has been included, meaning that ADAM tasks can now be used to
plot to an ARGS. 


5.9 Parameter System     ________________ 

The routine PAR_PROMT has been implemented. This  allows  a  task  to
generate the prompt string for a parameter at run time. 




                                                                 ARN/10.1                          5                          ARN/10.1



The routine DAT_EXIST has been modified so as to allow code such as 
      CALL DAT_EXIST ( 'JUNK', 'UPDATE', LOC, STATUS ) 
      IF ( STATUS .EQ. PAR__ERROR ) THEN 
         CALL DAT_CREAT ( 'JUNK', 'STRUC', 0, 0, STATUS ) 
         CALL DAT_ASSOC ( 'JUNK', 'UPDATE', LOC, STATUS ) 
      ENDIF 
to behave as one might reasonably expect. 

Small (< 6 element) dynamic default vectors set using PAR_DEF1<T> are
now  shown  on the prompt line as a list of values rather than an HDS
name. The  format  for  displaying  default  _REAL  values  has  been
improved. 

The type 'LITERAL' has been added  to  the  possible  standard  types
declared  in  the  interface  file.  The  parameter system interprets
LITERAL parameters as scalar character strings, even if they  do  not
have  quotes. This implies that one can never give the name of an HDS
structure containing the 'true' value of the parameter for a  LITERAL
parameter. 


5.10 SMS      ___ 

The Screen Management System has undergone extensive development. 


   5.10.1 Screen handling 

   SMS now uses the VMS version 4 SMG routines for terminal handling.
   This  results  in  the following changes which are apparent to the
   user: 
      - scroll region delimiters are solid rather than dotted lines 
      - screen write and erase operations are generally faster 


   5.10.2 Titles 

   Menu and parameter display  titles,  if  present  in  the  control
   table,  are  now  displayed in the top left of the display border.
   Note that a display  is  automatically  bordered  (with  the  line
   "box") if a title is added. 


   5.10.3 Macros 

   The macro display has been changed to take up less  space  on  the
   screen. The facility for using nested macros has been implemented.
   This means that when defining a  macro,  you  can  use  previously
   defined  macros  inside  the  one you are defining by pressing the
   appropriate numeric keypad key. There is a  trap  to  prevent  you
   from  using  the key you are presently defining (this was a bug in
   the previous version). 




                                                                 ARN/10.1                          6                          ARN/10.1



   5.10.4 SMS exit 

   An "exit" or "quit" from the  top-level  (or  root,  depending  on
   which way you look at it) menu causes a check to ask if you really
   want to exit SMS. This is in response to user requests. 


   5.10.5 SMS configuration 

   Since SMS is designed to  display  only  one  parameter  list  (or
   "switch  field")  at once, it cannot be configured via the "comma"
   key function whilst displaying a parameter list.  A trap has  been
   added to prevent this happening. 


   5.10.6 Help system 

   SMS uses the new version of the ADAM help system and  can  display
   "full"  help;  to do this, press "?" to get the one-line help, and
   press "?" again to get full help if any is present.  Note that  to
   start  up the system, a file "sms_helpfile.ahf" must be present in
   a directory search path specified by the logical name "adam_help".
   By default, this is set up to be "[]" (current directory) followed
   by "[adam.help]".  The  facility  for  switching  to  a  different
   helpfile  has  also  been  added  as part of the SMS configuration
   parameter list. 

   In addition, the keypad "minus" key has been allocated to put  the
   user  into  an SMS "system help" menu.  This change means that the
   system part of the control table ("smstable") has  been  extended,
   and  existing  tables need the new version as a replacement.  This
   new  version   of   the   system   part   exists   as   the   file
   "sms_dir:smssystab.sct". 


   5.10.7 Scrolling device 

   The separate scrolling device feature in the previous version  has
   not  been implemented yet.  An attempt to set the scroll device to
   anything other than "TT" in the configuration parameter list  will
   cause scrolling region output not to be displayed. 


5.11 ADAMCL      ______ 

The ADAMCL manual is to be found in AON001. 


   5.11.1 CLITASK 

   A 'background' version of ADAMCL called CLITASK now  exists.  This
   is loaded as an ADAM task and can be sent commands by 




                                                                 ARN/10.1                          7                          ARN/10.1



   Adamcl:> LOADW CLITASK 
   Adamcl:> SEND CLITASK OBEY RUN command 

   Where command is  any  ADAMCL  command  line.  This  enables,  for
   example,  ADAMCL  procedures  to  be executed without tying-up the
   terminal. 


   5.11.2 HELP 

   ADAMCL now uses the  ADAM  HELP  system.  On  startup,  ADAMCL  is
   attached  to  its own help file, but the HELP @name command allows
   the selected help file to be changed. 


   5.11.3 Task caching 

   Task caching has been implemented. This is designed primarily with
   data  analysis  in  mind  and complements the LOADW/KILL method of
   creating and removing tasks. A task is  loaded  into  the  'cache'
   automatically  whenever ADAMCL attempts to communicate with a task
   which does not exist. The cache has a fixed size. When  the  cache
   is  full,  the  creation  of  a  new cached task causes one of the
   others to be killed. Tasks loaded using LOADW are non-cached.  The
   command  SHOWTASK  lists the cached and non-cached tasks currently
   known to ADAMCL. The command CONTASK switches a task  from  cached
   to  non-cached  or  vice-versa.  On leaving ADAMCL, all the cached
   tasks are killed automatically. Non-cached tasks remain. 


   5.11.4 Reporting 

   The ADAMCL REPORT facility has been changed to use the LOG system.
   The  command REPORT switches default reporting on. This copies all
   typed-in commands, prompts and output from PRINT to the log  file.
   REPORT  ALL records everything, including commands executed inside
   procedures, output from the HELP commands  and  echoing  of  BATCH
   input.  Because  the log file is nonprintable, the command REPFILE
   is provided to translate it into an ordinary text file. 


   5.11.5 Startup batch files 

   ADAMCL now attempts to read two batch files on first startup.  The
   first is ADAMDIR:GOD.PRC, as before. The second may be assigned to
   the logical name USER_GOD by the user. 


   5.11.6  New commands 

   The following new commands have been added to ADAMCL. 





                                                                 ARN/10.1                          8                          ARN/10.1



      [square brackets means the parameter is optional] 

   ? - give help information or switch help files 
   ?? - give full help on the named item 
   COMPARE - compare character strings 
   CONCAT - concatenate character strings 
   CONTASK - switches a task from cached to non-cached or vice-versa 
   ERASE - clears the screen of a VT terminal 
   LOADD - load-with-wait a task as a detached process 
   LOADDICT - load the ADAMCL dictionary from a file 
   REPFILE - copy the ADAM logging file to a text file 
   SAVEDICT - save the ADAMCL dictionary to a file 
   SHOWTASK - list the known cached/non-cached tasks 


5.12 The minimal system      __________________ 

The subdirectories [ADAM.RELEASE...] contain all that  is  necessary,
apart  from  the  shareable  images,  to  run  the ADAM system and to
develop tasks. 

To produce a minimal release 

$ COPY [ADAM.LIB]ADAMSHARE.EXE [ADAM.RELEASE.EXE]* 
$ COPY [ADAM.LIB]ADAMGRAPH.EXE [ADAM.RELEASE.EXE]* 

then backup or copy [ADAM.RELEASE...]*.*. 

Inspection of the command files in [ADAM.RELEASE] will reveal what is
needed to start the system up. 


5.13 Status returns from ACT      _______________________ 

The numeric values of ACT__STAGE, ACT__RESCHED, etc.  as  defined  by
the DTDEFNS include file have all been changed. This is so that their
values can be distinguished from VMS status numbers. It implies  that
all  writers  of  Dtasks  should recompile any routines which include
DTDEFNS. 



6. STILL MISSING FROM THIS RELEASE 


The following list is not complete but indicates  major  areas  where
some action might be expected soon.

8. KNOWN BUGS 


These are the most important bugs found that can potentially  produce
unwanted  effects and may cause confusion.  Please let us know of any
unusual behaviour of the system ! 

(1) At present, any task can have channels open to no  more  than  20
other tasks simultaneously. (This is a 'feature' rather than a bug). 




                                                                 ARN/10.1                          10                         ARN/10.1



(2) When the "engineering interface" is started up, it can be  "hung"
completely by typing something before the prompt appears. (Get out of
this with ctrl-Y.) 

(3) If a number of SEND <task> OBEY  commands  are  issued  within  a
command  language  loop,  the  message  system  fills  with the final
acknowledgements. The cure is to avoid SEND <task> OBEY in a loop  by
using OBEYW instead. 

(4) Incomplete implementation of VPATH 'CURRENT'. See ARN6. 

(5) The RPATH field in the IFL is not yet implemented. 

(6) DIA_ASSOC and DIA_ANNUL appear to work satisfactorily  the  first
time  an  A-task is run, but give GKS errors the second time the task
is run. (This problem has been solved under GKS 7.2). 

(7) In Dtasks, array parameters with their  literal  list  of  values
defaulted in the IFL must not be put on a NEEDS list.
