1  INTRODUCTION

This document summarises suggestions for enhancing the ADAM  parameter
system discussed by BDK and JAB during April 1987.



2  DEFAULT NULL STATE

A discussion has  been  taking  place  concerning  the  definition  of
standard  data  structures, particularly those to be handled by KAPPA.
One of the problems has concerned the positioning of AXIS  data,  when
the  data  might be relevant to more than one DATA_ARRAY.  Suggestions
for overcoming this problem have  included  general  tree-walking  (ie
applications  should  search  upwards through data structures) and the
use of references to point from  one  part  of  a  data  structure  to
another.

Our initial feeling is that both these solutions are over-elaborate.

We propose that the interface file syntax should be extended to  allow
a  parameter to be placed in the NULL state by default.  The algorithm
for picking up (say) a DATA_ARRAY plus associated AXIS structure would
be as follows

       .
       .
   parameter junk2
      vpath 'default'
      default !
   endparameter
       .

       .

*
*   Ask for the structure containing the DATA_ARRAY
*
      CALL DAT_ASSOC ( 'JUNK1', 'READ', LOC1, STATUS )
*
*   Ask for the AXIS data structure
*
      CALL DAT_ASSOC ( 'JUNK2', 'READ', LOC2, STATUS )
      IF ( STATUS .EQ. PAR__NULL ) THEN
*
*      The structure has not been defined on the command line.
*      Look for it as part of the data.
*
         STATUS = SAI__OK
         CALL DAT_FIND ( LOC1, 'AXIS', LOC2, STATUS )
         IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) THEN
*
*         No axis data. Do without it.
*
                .
                .


We think that this approach should handle most standard cases.



3  ENHANCEMENTS FOR FIGARO

FIGARO would benefit greatly from having three features adding to  the
parameter system.  The first involves providing control over where the
value presented on the prompt-line comes from.   The  second  involves
forcing  this  value to be taken as the actual parameter value without
the user being prompted at all.  The third involves forcing  prompting
for values, in other words, overriding the VPATH.



3.1  Prompt Value Search Path

Currently, when a user is prompted  for  a  parameter,  the  parameter
system  displays  a  value  on  the prompt line if either a dynamic or
static default  exists  for  the  parameter.   The  user  causes  this
displayed  value  to  become  the  actual  value  of  the parameter by
responding with carriage-return.  To avoid ambiguous use of  the  word
'default',  we  shall  call  the  value  displayed  the  PROMPT VALUE.
Currently a hard-wired search-path is taken to find the prompt  value.
If  a dynamic default exists, then it is used.  If there is no dynamic
default, the static default (as defined  in  the  IFL)  is  used.   If
neither  dynamic  nor  static  defaults  exist,  then  no prompt value

appears.

It is proposed that the search-path for the  prompt  value  should  be
controlled  by  an  entry in the interface file with syntax similar to
that for VPATH.

   PPATH 'CURRENT,DYNAMIC,DEFAULT'

might be an example.

It is further proposed that there should be some dynamic control  over
this  search-path, equivalent to the FIGARO RESET feature.  This would
have the effect, for the current invocation of the  application  only,
of  removing any 'CURRENT' entries from the prompt search-path for any
parameters which have not yet been given values.



3.2  Forcing Acceptance Of Prompt Values

It is proposed that a feature equivalent to the FIGARO '\'  should  be
added.   This would have the effect, for the current invocation of the
application only, of causing any parameters which have  not  yet  been
given  values  to  accept  the  value  from  the  prompt-path  without
prompting the user.

It should be possible to have both reset and prompt acceptance enabled
simultaneously.



3.3  Forcing Prompting

It is proposed that a feature equivalent to the  FIGARO  PROMPT  state
should  be  added.   This  would  have  the  effect,  for  the current
invocation of the application only, of causing  any  parameters  which
have  not  yet  been  given  values to be prompted for irrespective of
their declared VPATHs.

It should be  possible  to  have  both  reset  and  prompting  enabled
simultaneously.



4  SYNTAX

An interface file syntax has to be defined to set a parameter into the
NULL state and to specify a prompt search-path.

A command-line syntax has  to  be  specified  to  allow  a  number  of
parameter  values  to  be  given, followed by a RESET and/or an ACCEPT
PROMPT symbol, or followed by a RESET and/or a PROMPT symbol.

The specification of the syntax is open to discussion.
