                ADAMCL logging, remoting and prompts                 ____________________________________ 







1. INTRODUCTION 


This document describes  proposed  changes  to  ADAMCL.  The  changes
involve  the  production  of  the  logfile  (REPORT facility) and the
implementation  of  a  REMOTE  facility.  The  latter  involves   the
generation  of  a  logfile which can be written by multiple processes
and read incrementally by a process transferring  the  log  across  a
network. Finally, it is proposed that the appearance of the task name
at the beginning of  prompt  strings  and  messages  should  be  made
switchable. 



2. LOGGING 




2.1 The meaning of logging     ______________________ 

Only logging directly relevant to ADAMCL is considered.  The  logging
of  information  known to tasks but not explicitly known to ADAMCL is
ignored. A superficial definition of logging then becomes 

"Writing to a file all information known to ADAMCL which also appears
on the terminal screen" 

In practice, this definition includes a heterogeneous  collection  of
information which it is useful to split into classes. 

command prompts from ADAMCL 
commands input by user 



                                                                 ASP/3.1                           2                           ASP/3.1



value prompts from ADAMCL 
values input by user 
program parameter prompts 
program parameter values input by user 
messages from tasks 
output from ADAMCL PRINT 
HELP output 
error messages 

It is probably also useful to add input to ADAMCL from a batch  file,
although this does not appear on the terminal. 


2.2 Present REPORT facility     _______________________ 

This consists of two commands. REPORT switches reporting on.  Reports
are  appended to a text file called <process_name>.REP in the current
directory. This has  been  known  to  cause  trouble  when  a  user's
process_name  is  not  a valid filename. Reporting is switched off by
the command NOREP, which also closes the output file. The information
logged  consists  only  of  commands  typed  by  the  user  and error
messages. 


2.3 Proposed REPORT facility     ________________________ 



   2.3.1 Logging categories 

   It makes sense to group prompts with the corresponding user input.
   For  implementation  reasons,  it  is  also  convenient  to  group
   together command prompts with value prompts from  built-in  ADAMCL
   commands (eg. ASKNUM). 

   COMMS 
   command prompts from ADAMCL //  commands input by user 
   value prompts from ADAMCL  //  values input by user 

   PROMPTS 
   program parameter prompts//program parameter values input by user 

   MSG 
   messages from tasks 

   PRINT 
   output from ADAMCL PRINT 

   HELP 
   HELP output 

   ERRORS 
   error messages 



                                                                 ASP/3.1                           3                           ASP/3.1



   BATCH 
   echo of batch input 

   Experience is likely to extend or modify this classification. 


   2.3.2 Control of logging 

   It is proposed that  the  various  logging  categories  should  be
   independently switchable. This will be done by the commands 

   LOG <list> 

   NOLOG <list> 

   where <list> is a list of one or more category names. 

   LOG HELP ERRORS 

   would enable logging of HELP and ERRORS output, without  disabling
   any previously enabled categories. 


   2.3.3 The REPORT command 

   It is proposed that the REPORT command should become 

   REPORT [filename] 

   where filename is the name of the file to which the  log  will  be
   appended.  If  filename  is  not specified, it will be invented as
   previously. A default choice of logging categories will be set  up
   on  initial  entry  to  ADAMCL. The REPORT and NOREP commands will
   have no effect on the enabled categories. 

   It is proposed that the default logging categories should be 

   COMMS PROMPTS MSG PRINT ERRORS 



3. REMOTE OBSERVING 


The intention remains that implementation  of  remote  command  entry
should  require  no special features in ADAMCL, but should be handled
automatically by the message system.  However,  the  biggest  use  of
remote  observing  is  likely  to  fall  in  the  category  of remote
eavesdropping. In this case, the remote observer has to be  presented
with  information  about  what  is  happening  on the computer at the
telescope. 





                                                                 ASP/3.1                           4                           ASP/3.1



3.1 General approach to remote eavesdropping     ________________________________________ 

Arguably, the remote eavesdropper  is  seeing  the  'log'  as  it  is
updated.  However,  he  also wants to see information not going via a
specific user interface. It seems that the simplest  solution  is  to
have  a  disk  file  on  the  telescope  computer  which has relevant
information appended to it, and to have a task which reads  the  file
and  copies  new  information to the remote observer. The task has to
keep track of how much of the log has been  transferred  successfully
so  that  it  can  recommence  at  the  correct place in the event of
network breaks. The log file is accessed by multiple writers, so this
has to be handled carefully. The individual entries probably ought to
be time-stamped. 


3.2 Requirement specific to ADAMCL     ______________________________ 

ADAMCL has to append information to the eavesdropping log.  At  first
sight  this  appears  to  be  the  same  requirement as the reporting
facility. The report file, however, is written to only  by  a  single
copy  of  ADAMCL.  Furthermore, it is a simple text file, which means
that DCL commands such as TYPE, EDIT and PRINT  can  be  used  on  it
successfully.  As an experiment, it seems that commands to enable and
disable copying of the currently enabled logging categories would  be
sufficient. 

eg. 

$ ADAMCL 

Adamcl:> EAVES 

Would cause the default  categories  of  information  to  go  to  the
eavesdropping file, while no REPORTing would be occurring. 



4. PROMPT STRINGS 


From time to time requests have been made for changes to the  display
of messages and prompts which ADAMCL has received from tasks. 


4.1 Present prompt and message output     _________________________________ 

Currently, all messages and prompts from tasks are displayed  on  the
terminal  preceded  by  the name of the originating task. This can be
useful  when  multitasking,  but  can  be  annoying   during   simple
sequential  use  of the system, particularly for data analysis. Apart
from showing extraneous information, it also reduces the space  on  a
line available for prompts and responses. 




                                                                 ASP/3.1                           5                           ASP/3.1



4.2 Proposed change     _______________ 

It is proposed that the presence  of  the  taskname  should  be  made
switchable  by  the commands SHOWTASK and HIDETASK. It is not obvious
whether the contents of the log files should be affected. 



5. COMMAND NAMES 


This document has been concerned with a number of areas where  ADAMCL
options  are  switchable.  This involves the creation of commands for
toggling logical values. It is desirable that  such  commands  should
conform  to  some  pattern  so  that  a  user can deduce the negative
command from knowing the positive command. 

A simple pattern would be 

SET LOG ON <list> 
SET LOG OFF <list> 
SET REPORTING ON [filename] 
SET REPORTING OFF 
SET SHOWTASK ON 
SET SHOWTASK OFF 

However, this might be considered rather verbose. It also has  a  bad
effect  on the presentation of HELP information. One might be tempted
to simply leave the SET off the beginning, however,  one  can  see  a
requirement for commands such as 

SHOW LOG 
SHOW REPORTING 
SHOW SHOWTASK 
SHOW DICTIONARY 
SHOW VARIABLES 

Suggestions of ways to resolve  these  problems  will  be  gratefully
received.
