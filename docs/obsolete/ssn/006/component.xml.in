  <description>The Cipher M990 Tape drive</description>
  <abstract><p>
     This document is aimed at Site Managers and describes how to make
     the most of their Cipher M990s. Some of these devices have not
     been optimally set-up by engineers and some simple tuning may
     improve performance dramatically. Any corrections, improvements
     or suggestions for this document will be most gratefully received
     by the author. This document does not attempt to explain to users
     how to use the drive since this is almost impossible to do this
     without complex diagrams and it is far more effective for a Site
     Manager to actually demonstrate the procedures to new users.
