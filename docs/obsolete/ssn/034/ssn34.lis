                 CDS - Database Administrator's Guide
                 ------------------------------------



1  PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE

This guide aims to instruct the CDS database administrator in:

      o  The CDS file system.

      o  The CDS index files.

      o  The procedure for  assimilating  a  new  CDS  tape  into  the
         database.

It is assumed that the administrator has read SUN/79.



2  CDS FILE SYSTEM

Logical names are set up by  the  START_CAR  command.   The  procedure
invoked  by this symbol should be run whenever you do anything in this
tree.

The  root  of  the  directory  tree  is  "CDS"  currently  located  on
DISK$IRAS:[CDSDIR.CDS].  The tree is depicted below; logical names are
in brackets:

The main directory only contains subdirectory files.



2.1  BACK

BACK contains the CDS backup system.  This is easier to use  than  the
ordinary  backup.  Just set default to [.BACK], then issue the command
@BACKMAC.



2.2  DOC

DOC contains the copies of SUN/79, SSN/34 and the  printable  versions
of  the  indexes which all have a filetype of CAR.  It also contains a
procedure REPORT.COM to generate new printable versions of the indexes
when the main index is updated.



2.3  DSCF

This contains the (very  large)  text  library  of  FACTS  description
files, CDSDSCF.TLB.



2.4  INDEX

This contains the FACTS description  files  and  data  files  for  the
indexes.   The  main  index is CDSI.DAT and its format is described in
DSCFCDSI.DAT.  CDST is CDSI, sorted  by  tape  and  filenumber.   CDSD
contains  those  entries of CDST which have the documentation flag set
to T.  Note  the  CRITERION  parameter  in  DSCFCDSD  which  activates
selection by CAR_SEARCH.  CDSA, CDSN, CDSO, CDSC, CDSW are versions of
CDSD sorted by AUTHOR_NAME, TITLE, OBJECT, CDS_CLASS, and WAVELENGTH.

There is an index antecedent to the CDSI called DATAINDEX.DAT which is
kept in this directory.

All the index files and description files can be typed and edited.

INDEX contains a procedure SORTINDEX to be performed  after  the  main
index has been updated after the assimilation of new CDS tapes.



2.5  MTANAL

This contains the printed outputs of the MTANAL utility.  Each listing
is suffixed with the tape name.  (After running MTANAL you must rename
the MTANAL.LIS.)



2.6  PROGRAMS

This contains the source and images for the programs  CDS_DATASET  and
CDS_TAPE.    CDS_DATASET   only   requires  the  INTERIM  environment.
CDS_TAPE requires to be linked with ADC; a procedure  is  provided  to
compile and link it.



3  CDS INDEX FILES

Keeping the indexes updated is  crucial  to  the  maintenance  of  the
database.   There are two index files:  DATAINDEX and CDSI.  There are
versions of CDSI sorted on various fields as explained above.

DATAINDEX is appended to  by  the  CDS_DATASET  program,  and  is  not
required by users directly.  DATAINDEX is not a FACTs file.  DATAINDEX
is read by the CDS_TAPE program as it processes each dataset on a tape
to  get the title, mnemonic, author, reference and keyword information
for the dataset.  There are  three  lines  for  each  dataset  in  the
DATAINDEX file.  The first dataset in the file is shown below:

        3079A83 F SPECTRUM OF GAMMA-TAU 5185 A TO 6005 A
        APPLA     APPLEQUIST,L. ET AL A&A. SUPP, 52, 237
        STAR/G-TAU        OPTICAL

The first record contains  the  dataset  id,  documentation  flag  and
title.  The second record contains the mnemonic, author and reference.
The third record contains the object keyword and wavelength keyword.

CDSI is appended to by the CDS_TAPE.  There is  one  record  for  each
dataset.   The  fields  are documented in DSCFCDSI.DAT.  You can amend
entries in CDSI using CAR_EDIT - it is possible, but not convenient to
edit it with the VMS editor as the records are 248 characters.

4  ASSIMILATING A CDS TAPE

When a CDS tape is received,  follow  the  following  procedure.   The
example used here is for SD999.

        $ SET DEF CDS
        $ SET DEF [.MTANAL]
        $ RUN UTILITYDIR:MTANAL to check the tape.

If there is no documentation or the tape is unreadable then
        Telex CDS about the fact and put the tape aside
else
        Rename the MTANAL.LIS.

        $ RENAME MTANAL.LIS  MTANALSD999.LIS

Get the documentation on  the  catalogue  and  the  catalogue  of  CDS
catalogues to hand and a copy of the MTANALSD999.LIS

        $ SET DEF CDS_INDEX
        $ CDS_DATASET

The program operates in a loop for each dataset  to  set  up  a  three
record  entry  for  the  DATAINDEX  file.   You  enter  the  requisite
information for each dataset on the tape.  The example above is  used.
The  space  for  your  string  is marked by "!" - don't overflow, make
abbreviations.  You can repeat a previous value of a string  by  using
the  "/"  character (some files have the same title etc).  Hints below
are marked with < > brackets.

        Give dataset id:
        !!!!!!!
        3079A83
< From MTANAL listing >
        Documentation ? (T/F):
        !
        F
< Do you have full documentation ? >
        Give full title, ("/" for same):
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        SPECTRUM OF GAMMA-TAU 5185 A TO 6005 A
< Use name from Catalogue of Catalogues else use the name in the >
< documentation >
        Give 5 character mnemonic:
        !!!!!
        APPLA
< first 4 characters of author name followed by dataset letter.>
        Give reference, ("/" for same):
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        APPLEQUIST,L. ET AL A&A. SUPP, 52, 237
< Use reference from the Catalogue of Catalogues else use the
< reference from the documentation.  Space marks end of AUTHOR_NAME>

        Give object keyword, ("/" for same):
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        STAR/G-TAU
< Main object type, qualifiers. Singulars only. >
< See CDSO.CAR for examples >
        Give wavelength keyword, ("/" for same):
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        OPTICAL
< One of RADIO INFRARED OPTICAL UV X-RAY GAMMA-RAY >
        END:=
< Type END to finish, hit return for the next dataset >

You correct any errors in DATAINDEX with  the  editor.   Allocate  and
mount the tape and give the deck logical name TAPE0 or TAPE1.

        $ CAR_MOUNT

Run the CDS_TAPE program:

        $ CDS_TAPE/DECK=TAPE0/TAPE=SD999

The program then proceeds to process each  dataset  on  the  tape  and
update  the  CDSI,  using physical information taken from the tape and
index information from DATAINDEX.

When CDS_TAPE has ended, make a security copy of the CDS tape using  a
tape utility (eg MTCOPY).

Put the description files generated by CDS_TAPE into the CDSDSCF  text
library:

        $ LIB/REPLACE/LOG/TEXT CDS_DSCF:CDSDSCF.TLB DSCF*.DAT

and then delete the description files:

        $ DEL DSCF*.DAT.*

Now regenerate the other (user) index files, CDSA etc:

        $ SET DEF CDS_INDEX
        $ @SORTINDEX

Then regenerate the printed reports:

        $ SET DEF CDS_DOC
        $ @REPORTS
        $ R27LASER *.CAR

The VAX work is now finished.

Use laser output for CDSA.CAR to update appendix A and B to SUN/79.

Send the printed documentation to reprographics  and  have  10  copies
made.  Send one copy to the site manager at each Starlink node.  Issue
a NEWS item on CDS catalogues to the effect that new  catalogues  have
just been received.
