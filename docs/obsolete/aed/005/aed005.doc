              Generating Files for the Adam Help System               _________________________________________ 







1. Introduction 


This document contains information on the ADAM help  system  relevant
to  those  programmers providing the help information for any part of
the ADAM system;  this includes help on system components,  and  help
on  specific  instruments,  D-tasks, A-tasks and so on.  It describes
how to write the help source files, and how to convert these into the
form  required  by ADAM user interfaces which display the help to the
user when required. 




2. General Information 


The ADAM help system was specified in ADN/12.1.  It is different from
VMS  help information in several ways;  the most important difference
being that, firstly, both "brief" and "full" help may be provided  on
any topic. Secondly, as presently specified the system does not allow
a deep tree structure to the help information;  the help  information
is  organised  on  the  basis of having one entry for each topic, and
under that one entry is held  the  "brief"  information,  the  "full"
information,  and if required information on any number of subtopics.
There is no provision at present  for  storing  data  deeper  in  the
structure (i.e. subtopics of subtopics). 

The "brief" help information is intended to be  no  longer  than  one
line  of  text,  which  can be displayed by the user interface on one
line of the user's terminal screen.  "Full" help and "subtopic"  help
can  be  much  longer;   it  is  stored  as  a  long  string, with no
end-of-line markers, because different user  interfaces  may  require



                                                                 AED/5.3                           2                           AED/5.3



the  text  in  differing  widths,  and  more  importantly  once  name
translation  is  implemented  the translation can alter line lengths.
However, information where the format is important can be included in
the  help  information  by  means  of an escape mechanism;  each line
which is not to be re-formatted must be enclosed by escape characters
(currently      backwards      single      quote,      defined     in
"helpsys_dir:constants.inc"). 

The help information is entered into a "source" file which  uses  the
VMS  help  source  format.   This  file is then used by the "addhelp"
utility to add the help information into  an  already  existing  help
file.   Thus, for example, a copy could be taken of the "ADAMCL" help
file, and additional information put into it relating to specific  A-
and  D-tasks  for  a  particular  instrument.   Note  that it is also
possible to over-write entries in the original help file;   this  may
be  required in certain cases, but if not then the person adding help
information to a particular file needs to be aware of what is already
contained therein. 




3. Help File Creation 


The stages in setting up an ADAM help file are as follows: 

1. Create the help source file using the text editor.  The format  is
identical  to  that  for VMS help source, except that only two levels
are  allowed,  and  there  is  a  specific  "level  2"  entry   name,
"HELP_LINE",  which may be used to specify the brief help information
for each entry in the help structure.  See the  example  below.   You
can  best  look  at the information in this source file by putting it
into a VMS help library and running the VMS help system  on  it  (see
Appendix). 

2. Type the DCL symbol "ADDHELP".  This runs a FORTRAN program  which
optionally  creates  the help file. It then adds the help information
in the help source into the help structure.  It over-writes  previous
entries  of  the  same  name, and so can be used to correct or update
help information.  New entries are created as required.   If  you  do
not  provide parameters to this command it will prompt for them.  The
parameters are new file (Y or N), the source file name and the output
container file name, in that order. 

3. You can look at the structure you have created using any  suitable
application, e.g. the "LS" (list structure) tool or "TRACE". 









                                                                 AED/5.3                           3                           AED/5.3



4. Using the Help File 


When the user interface which uses  the  help  information  you  have
stored  is run, the logical name "ADAM_HELP" must be set up to define
a directory search path which  includes  the  help  system  container
file. 




5. Example Source File 



1 help_level 
The "help_level" switch determines the level of help information 
output by the system.  Level 1 selects brief help, i.e. when help 
is requested only the brief help information held in the system is 
given by default. Level 2 defaults to giving full help information. 
The "auto" setting will adjust the level of help information given 
depending on the way the system is used. 
2 HELP_LINE 
"help_level" 1 gives brief help, 2 gives full help 
1 beep 
The "beep" switch determines whether or not the SMS system uses the 
terminal "bell" to signal various conditions to the user.  This can 
be silenced by setting the switch to "off". 
2 HELP_LINE 
"beep" switches the terminal "bell" on or off as selected 
1 another 
This is another item of help in the help library.  This part is the 
main text for the help, and can be as long as required (up to 65535 
characters).  The user interface will format it appropriately to the 
help device selected by the user.  It should in general be 
accompanied by a "level 2" entry with the name "HELP_LINE";  this 
will be used by the help system as the "brief" help information. 
This entry also has two other subtopics, which must also be given as 
level 2 entries. 
2 HELP_LINE 
I don't know what this command does. 
2 subtopic_1 
This is the help information on the first subtopic, which again can 
cover as many lines as required.  In the ADAM help system as 
presently specified, you can't go any deeper than this level. 
2 subtopic_2 
This is the subtopic_2 help information. 
1 table_stuff 
This help item contains tabular information.  The table itself needs 
to have each line escaped at both ends;  the escape character is 
currently backwards single quote. 
`This line shows the escape characters at each end.` 
`The next is a blank line:` 



                                                                 AED/5.3                           4                           AED/5.3



`` 
`   Name              Rating` 
`  Lagavulin         excellent` 
`  Jura              no' bad at all` 
`  Talisker          OK if at least 25 yrs old` 
`` 
This stuff here should be out of the escaped table format 
again, and packed up 
to (I think) 72 characters 
per line or whatever is used in the test run. 
2 HELP_LINE 
An example of embedded tabular information that doesn't get 
reformatted. 





6. Name Translation 


A facility in the ADAM help system is that names in the supplied help
file  may  be  translated  to  "public  names" under the control of a
translation table.  This feature is not yet implemented and  will  be
described in a further version of this document. 




7. Appendix 



Using the VMS help system: 


1. Create a help library using 

$ library/help/create myhelp 


2. Insert the contents of your help source using 

$ library/help/insert myhelp myhelp.hlp 


3. Run the HELP system on this library with 

$ help/lib=<full_directory_spec>:myhelp 


The help library behaves as a standard VMS help facility.
