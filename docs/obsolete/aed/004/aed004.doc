                     Adam Help System Interface                      __________________________ 







1. Introduction 


This document describes the subroutine calls which interface into the
ADAM  help  system.   The implementation is not quite complete but is
now usable;  these calls should not change. 




2. Getting help out of the system 


In a user interface, the help system calls need to be used to get the
help  information in the form of character strings.  It is the job of
the user interface to format these strings as  required.   There  are
three  subroutines to get information out of the system, although one
additional subroutine is provided to split  the  help  text  up  into
lines  of  a given width.  Two additional subroutines are provided to
aid practical use of the help system. It is also necessary  to  start
up  and  shut down the help system cleanly;  there are two subroutine
calls to do this. Finally, there is a subroutine to enable  switching
between help files. 

The help information is obtained from  an  HDS  container  file  (see
AED/5  for details of how to generate this). It has default file type
'.AHF' (Adam Help File) and is assumed to  lie  on  the  search  path
defined by the logical name ADAM_HELP. 








                                                                 AED/4.3                           2                           AED/4.3





2.1 Starting up and shutting down     _____________________________ 

HELPSYS uses  HDS  for  storing  its  information.  This  means  that
HDS_START  must  have  been  called at some time prior to any HELPSYS
calls. HDS_STOP should be called at sometime after HELPSYS  has  been
used.  Writers  of  user interfaces must handle this. However, if the
HELPSYS is being called from  within  an  ADAM  task,  HDS_START  and
HDS_STOP   must   NOT  be  called,  as  the  ADAM  system  does  this
automatically. 

The two subroutines for starting up and shutting down the system are:

    helpsys_startup - start up the ADAM help system 

    Description : 
     Start up the ADAM help system, initialising any global variables 
     needed. Open the initial helpfile. 
    Invocation : 
     call helpsys_startup ( helpfile, status ) 
    Parameters : 
     helpfile = character*(*) (READ) 
          The name of the initial help file. This is searched for 
          following the search-path of directories specified by the 
          logical name ADAM_HELP. It has a default file type of .AHF. 
     status = integer (UPDATE) 
          Global status, if this has an error value on entry then an 
          immediate return will occur. If an error occurs during the 
          execution of this routine then STATUS will be returned 
          containing the appropriate error value. 


    helpsys_shutdown - shut down the ADAM help system 

    Description : 
     Shut down the ADAM help system. Close the current helpfile. 
    Invocation : 
     call helpsys_shutdown ( status ) 
    Parameters : 
     status = integer (UPDATE) 
          Global status, if this has an error value on entry then an 
          immediate return will occur. If an error occurs during the 
          execution of this routine then STATUS will be returned 
          containing the appropriate error value. 




2.2 Selecting the help file     _______________________ 

The current help  file  can  be  changed  by  calling  the  following
routine. 



                                                                 AED/4.3                           3                           AED/4.3



    helpsys_setfile - change the current ADAM help file 

    Description : 
     Check the requested helpfile exists. If it does, close the 
     current helpfile and open the new one. 
    Invocation : 
     call helpsys_setfile ( helpfile, status ) 
    Parameters : 
     helpfile = character*(*) (READ) 
          The name of the new help file. This is searched for 
          following the search-path of directories specified by the 
          logical name ADAM_HELP. It has a default file type of .AHF. 
     status = integer (UPDATE) 
          Global status, if this has an error value on entry then an 
          immediate return will occur. If an error occurs during the 
          execution of this routine then STATUS will be returned 
          containing the appropriate error value. 




2.3 Getting the help information     ____________________________ 

The help information is obtained using three subroutines.  These are:

    helpsys_briefget - get brief help information 

    Description : 
     The brief help information available on the topic with name 
     "publicname" is returned in "helpline".  The number of valid 
     characters is given in "numchars". 
    Invocation : 
     call helpsys_briefget ( publicname, numchars, helpline, status ) 
    Parameters : 
     publicname = character*(*) (READ) 
          Public name for the topic. 
     numchars = integer (WRITE) 
          Number of valid characters returned. 
     helpline = character*(*) (WRITE) 
          String containing brief help information. 
     status = integer (UPDATE) 
          Global status, if this has an error value on entry then an 
          immediate return will occur. If an error occurs during the 
          execution of this routine then STATUS will be returned 
          containing the appropriate error value. 

          The status "HELPSYS__NOHELP" means that there is no brief 
          help information held on that topic, or that there is no 
          entry for that topic. 


    helpsys_fullget - get full help information 




                                                                 AED/4.3                           4                           AED/4.3



    Description : 
     The full help information available on the topic with name 
     "publicname" is returned in "helptext".  The number of valid 
     characters is given in "numchars". 
    Invocation : 
     call helpsys_fullget ( publicname, numchars, helptext, status ) 
    Parameters : 
     publicname = character*(*) (READ) 
          Public name for the topic. 
     numchars = integer (WRITE) 
          Number of valid characters returned. 
     helptext = character*(*) (WRITE) 
          String containing the full help information. 
     status = integer (UPDATE) 
          Global status, if this has an error value on entry then an 
          immediate return will occur. If an error occurs during the 
          execution of this routine then STATUS will be returned 
          containing the appropriate error value. 

          The status "HELPSYS__NOHELP" means that there is no full 
          help information, or there is no entry for that topic. 


    helpsys_subtget - get subtopic help information 

    Description : 
     The subtopic information available on the subtopic with name 
     "subtopicname" held under the topic with name "publicname" is 
     returned in "helptext".  The number of valid characters is given 
     in "numchars". 
    Invocation : 
     call helpsys_subtget ( publicname, subtopicname, numchars, 
    :                       helptext, status ) 
    Parameters : 
     publicname = character*(*) (READ) 
           The public name for the topic. 
     subtopicname = character*(*) (READ) 
           The associated subtopic name. 
     numchars = integer (WRITE) 
           Number of valid characters in the subtopic help 
           information. 
     helptext = character*(*) (WRITE) 
           The subtopic help information. 
     status = integer (UPDATE) 
           Global status, if this has an error value on entry then an 
           immediate return will occur. If an error occurs during the 
           execution of this routine then STATUS will be returned 
           containing the appropriate error value. 

           The status "HELPSYS__NOHELP" means that there is no help 
           information on the subtopic specified, or there is no 
           entry for that topic. 




                                                                 AED/4.3                           5                           AED/4.3






2.4 Additional routines     ___________________ 

These allow the user to get a list of available help topics,  a  list
of  available  help subtopics for a given topic, and to split full or
subtopic help information up into lines of a given length.

     topic name "publicname" are returned in "numsubtopics" and 
     "subtopicnames". 
    Invocation : 
     call helpsys_subtopics ( publicname, numsubtopics, 
    :                         subtopicnames, status ) 
    Parameters :

           Array of topic names held in the help structure. 
     status = integer (UPDATE) 
           Global status, if this has an error value on entry then an 
           immediate return will occur. If an error occurs during the 
           execution of this routine then STATUS will be returned 



                                                                 AED/4.3                           6                           AED/4.3



           containing the appropriate error value. 

           The status "HELPSYS__NOHELP" means that there is no 
           subtopic help information, or no entry for this topic. 
    Deficiencies : 
     The subtopic names are not yet sorted alphanumerically. 


    helpsys_fullsplit - split full help text into lines 

    Description : 
     Splits up the "helptext" into lines of maximum length "maxlen" 
     without splitting words.  The lines are put into array elements 
     of "outarray". 
    Invocation : 
     call helpsys_fullsplit ( helptext, numchars, maxlen, 
    :                  maxlines, outarray, numlines, status ) 
    Parameters : 
     helptext = character*(*) (READ) 
           A string of words (help information).  Tabular information 
           may be escaped by the sequence 
              <escape character> <text and spaces> <escape character> 
           This is passed as a whole to the output string, as a new 
           line.  The escape character is defined in "helpsys_par". 
     numchars = integer (READ) 
           Number of valid characters in "helptext". 
     maxlen = integer (READ) 
           Maximum length of a line of output text put into 
           "outarray" (Usually the size of the "outarray" elements). 
     maxlines = integer (READ) 
           Maximum number of lines to be returned.  (Usually the size 
           of the output array "outarray"). 
     outarray = character*(*) array (WRITE) 
           The output array, with one line per array element, and 
           escape characters removed. 
     numlines = integer (WRITE) 
           Number of valid lines returned in "outarray". 
     status = integer (UPDATE) 
           Global status, if this has an error value on entry then an 
           immediate return will occur. If an error occurs during the 
           execution of this routine then STATUS will be returned 
           containing the appropriate error value. 





3. Status Information 


The help system status returns may be signalled in the usual  manner;
the    object    module    containing    the    VMS    messages    is
"helpsys_dir:helpmsg.obj".  The status values are also available as a



                                                                 AED/4.3                           7                           AED/4.3



FORTRAN include file in "helpsys_dir:helpmsg.for". 




4. Name Translation 


A feature of the ADAM help system is  that  a  translation  from  the
internal names of entries in the help file to "public names" is made.
Currently this feature is not implented, but when  it  has  been  the
effects  are  invisble  as  far  as  the  interface  subroutines  are
concerned.  The only difference is that a mechanism will be needed to
indicate the translation table to be used, if any.
