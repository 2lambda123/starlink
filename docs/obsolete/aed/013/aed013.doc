                       Generating Status Values
                       ------------------------





1  INTRODUCTION

The ADAM system consists of a large number of standard libraries.   In
addition,  a  large  set  of  complex  tasks,  many  of  them mutually
interacting, have been written to run under ADAM.  Much of the  system
and  applications  call  VMS  utility  routines.   It  is,  therefore,
necessary to have some mechanism for defining status  values  in  some
standard  way  which  avoids  accidental  clashes  between ADAM system
status values and VMS values.  This is done by using the  VMS  MESSAGE
utility,  plus  an  ADAM  tool  called ERRGEN to produce the necessary
FORTRAN INCLUDE file.



2  BACKGROUND READING

The ADAM MSG and ERR routines are described in AED/14.



3  GENERATING THE STATUS VALUES

The symbols for the status values have the form

PACKAGE__STATUS

where 'PACKAGE' relates to the library the symbol is associated  with,
and  'STATUS' is the name of the particular symbol.  The packages each
have a unique 'package number'; current ones are  given  in  the  file
"lib_dir:packages.lis".  Any new packages should have a package number
allocated by ROE (to ensure uniqueness) if they are to use this  error
system.

Once the code is designed, a number of  required  symbols,  and  their
associated messages, will have been specified.  The input file for the
VMS "message" utility can then be written; an example is given at  the
end  of  this  document.   The  'package  number' must be given in the
message utility input file.

The message utility is then invoked with

message/list <filename>

where <filename> has default type ".msg".  This  produces  two  output
files:   <filename>.obj  which  is  subsequently  linked with software
wishing to write out the messages, and <filename>.lis which is used as
input to the next tool.

The .LIS file should be inspected.  If the listing exceeds  one  page,
then  the file should be edited to remove the extra form-feeds and the
headers on the second and subsequent pages.

The <filename>.lis file is processed by  the  "ERRGEN"  tool  into  an
include  file  for FORTRAN, which should be included in the code which
references the symbols; it consists of parameter definitions  for  all
the symbol names.  This tool is invoked with

errgen <filename>

and produces the output file <filename>.for  which  is  the  "include"
file.   Note  that  this  tool is still "verbose" and produces lots of
junk whilst it is working.  Please ignore this !



4  SIGNALLING THE ERROR MESSAGES

The simplest way to signal  the  messages  generated  is  to  use  the
run-time  routine "lib$signal"; given the status return in a variable,
e.g.  "status", the error can be signalled with

      call lib$signal ( %val(status) )

providing that the code calling this routine has been linked with  the
<filename>.obj  file  for the particular package.  For fatal and error
conditions, a traceback is produced; for  fatal  conditions  the  task
terminates.   To  prevent  this  (e.g.   when  displaying fatal system
messages) there are ADAM utilities

UTIL_CHSEVI ( INSTATUS, OUTSTATUS )
UTIL_CHSEVE ( INSTATUS, OUTSTATUS )

to change the apparent severity of a given condition to  informational
and error respectively, but keep the associated message.

6  EXAMPLE GENERATED FORTRAN INCLUDE FILE

The MESSAGE utility output listing is generated as a .LIS file.   This
should  be  inspected.  If the listing exceeds one page, then the file
should be edited to remove the extra form-feeds and the headers on the
second and subsequent pages.  The ADAM ERRGEN utility can then be used
to create the FORTRAN INCLUDE file with type .FOR.  This is an example
of the output from ERRGEN.
