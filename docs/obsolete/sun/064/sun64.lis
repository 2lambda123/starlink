                 MONGO - Interactive Plotting Program
                 ------------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

MONGO is a set of commands which  make  it  possible  to  build  up  a
complicated  diagram, including graphics, text, axes and so on, and to
create publishable quality output.  It was written by John L Tonry and
modified  to run over SGS and GKS 7.2 by D J King (RGO).  It therefore
works on ALL devices supported by GKS.  MONGO is also available  as  a
collection  of  subroutines  which enthusiasts may use to create their
own programs.

MONGO can be activated by typing the command "MONGO" in response to  a
VMS  "$"  prompt.   When  MONGO  is running, you will get a "MONGO72>"
prompt.  Online help, similar to VMS help, is available by typing  the
command "HELP".  To exit from MONGO, type "END".

A comprehensive manual is available; if you require  a  copy,  contact
your  site  manager.   This  contains  four examples of MONGO plotting
which you can produce interactively yourself by typing  the  following
MONGO commands:

        TERMINAL 'workstation'
        INPUT MONGO72DIR:EX001.PL
        ERASE
        INPUT MONGO72DIR:EX002.PL
        ERASE
        INPUT MONGO72DIR:EX003.PL
        ERASE
        INPUT MONGO72DIR:EX004.PL
        ERASE

Where 'workstation' is the GKS workstation number or  SGS  workstation
name on which the plots are to be produced.

MONGO is only really suitable for production  of  publishable  quality
output.   It is too slow and too expensive in computer resources to be
put into a user's data reduction system.
