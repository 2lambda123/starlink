\section{Introduction}

{\bf NOTE:}~{\em This note refers mainly to the VAX implementations of the
NAG Library products}.

The NAG library is the primary general purpose mathematical subroutine library
installed by the Starlink project. It is a commercial package and cannot be
distributed by Starlink to non-Starlink sites. The following software is
scheduled for distribution to all Starlink sites:

\begin{description}

\item [NAG FORTRAN LIBRARY] : This is the standard `NAG Library' and is
documented in the {\em NAG Fortran Library Manual --- Mk 15}.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Single precision library} --- Calculations are carried out in
F\_floating format. This enables programs to occupy less space.

\item {\bf Double precision library} --- This is the default library.
Calculations are carried out in D\_floating format.

\item {\bf G\_floating library} --- This should be used when the numerical
range provided by the double precision library is inadequate. The increased
range is paid for a reduction in precision of 3 bits.

\end{itemize}

\item [NAG GRAPHICS LIBRARY] : This provides graphics facilities and is
documented in the {\em NAG Graphics Library Manual --- Mark 3}, and in SUN/29.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Single precision library} --- Calculations are carried out in
F\_floating format. This enables programs to occupy less space.

\item {\bf Double precision library} --- This is the default library.
Calculations are carried out in D\_floating format.

\end{itemize}

\item [NAG ON-LINE INFORMATION SUPPLEMENT] : This is an on-line help system.

\end{description}

The SERC has a general agreement with NAG Ltd covering the provision of the
NAG Fortran and Graphics Libraries, and the On-line Information Supplement for
various hardware platforms. Starlink participates in the agreement, and all
Starlink owned hardware is covered by it. Hardware owned by SERC outside of
Starlink is also covered, and may run the NAG products---including running the
Starlink implementation of the NAG products which differs slightly from
non-Starlink systems.  

As newer Marks/Releases/Versions become available, Starlink will update its
implementations. However, implementations on hardware types within Starlink may
not keep in step.

Details of the three floating point formats available are given in
Table~\ref{tab:types}.

\begin{small}
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Library & Fortran type & Bytes & Range & Precision \\
\hline
Single Precision & F\_floating & 4 & $0.29 * 10^{-38}$ to $1.7 * 10^{38}$ &
 23 bits (7 decimal digits) \\
Double Precision & D\_floating & 8 & $0.29 * 10^{-38}$ to $1.7 * 10^{38}$ &
 55 bits (16 decimal digits) \\
G Precision & G\_floating & 8 & $0.56 * 10^{-308}$ to $0.9 * 10^{308}$ &
 52 bits (15 decimal digits) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Data types available in NAG libraries}
\label{tab:types}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\end{small}

Table~\ref{tab:logs} specifies the logical names that may be used to refer
to the libraries and to the directories in which they are held.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
                     & Precision & Library            & Directory        \\
\hline
NAG Library          & Single    & {\bf NAGS\_LIB}    & {\bf NAGSDIR}    \\
                     & Double    & {\bf NAG\_LIB}     & {\bf NAGDIR}     \\
                     & G         & {\bf NAGG\_LIB}    & {\bf NAGGDIR}    \\
\hline
Graphical supplement & Single    & {\bf NAGRAFS\_LIB} & {\bf NAGRAFSDIR} \\
                     & Double    & {\bf NAGRAF\_LIB}  & {\bf NAGRAFDIR}  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Logical names defined for Starlink's NAG implementation}
\label{tab:logs}
\end{center}
\end{table}

{\bf NOTE:}~{\em The NAG library implementations are an Optional part of the
Starlink Software Collection. As such, part or all of the NAG software may not
be installed at your site---some sites may only have the single precision
implementations, some may have only the double precision implementations. If
the implementation you require is not installed at your site, please see your
Site Manager.}

This note is meant as a starting point for people wishing to use the NAG
library and graphical supplement. It is no substitute for the documentation
provided by NAG, which should be studied by any serious user of the library.

Besides the on-line help system, some documentation is held on-line in the
directory NAGDIR:

\begin{description}
\begin{description}

\item [CALLED.LIS] : For each routine in the Library (including auxiliaries)
this gives a list of those routines and example programs which call it directly
or indirectly.

\item [CALLS.LIS] : A list of routines called directly or indirectly by each
routine in the Library, and by each example program.

\item [ESSINT.DOC] : Essential Introduction to the NAG Fortran Library.

\item [IN.DOC] : Installers' Note.

\item [NEWS.DOC] : News about changes in Mark 15.

\item [SUMMARY.DOC] : Summary of routines and their purpose.

\item [UN.DOC] : Users' Note.

\end{description}
\end{description}

If you only have the single precision version, similar information is
available in NAGSDIR, but the some file names differ by having an `E' on the
end {\it e.g.} {\tt UNE.DOC} is the single precision Users' Note.

The following three files may also be available at your node:

\begin{description}
\begin{description}

\item [EXPT.TLB] : The Fortran source text of the example programs associated
with the routines, as run on a VAX.

\item [EXPD.TLB] : The data required to run the example programs.

\item [EXPR.TLB] : The results produced on a VAX.

\end{description}
\end{description}

These files are text libraries in which the material for individual programs
are stored as library modules. You may find these libraries useful when
investigating particular programs. All these files derive from the master tape
supplied by NAG Ltd.

The Users' Note supplies implementation-specific detail that augments the
information provided in the Library Manual and Introductory Guide. A copy
should be attached to this note (Appendix . \ref{se:usern}. NAG also supply the
following documents in printed form:

\begin{itemize}
\item NAG Fortran Library Manual
\item NAG Fortran Library Introductory Guide
\item NAG Newsletter (two or three times yearly)
\item NAG General Note: Error Bulletin (partly on microfiche).
\end{itemize}

The Introductory Guide consists of extracts from the Manual. Every Starlink
site has a copy of the first two documents. Your Site Manager will tell you
where they are kept.

The changes to the library introduced in Mark 15 are specified in the section
{\em Mark 15 News} in the Guide and Manual.

\section{How to get going}

If you know what you are doing and just want to know where the library is
stored, the link command needed is:
\begin{verbatim}
      $ LINK <prog>, NAG_LIB/LIB
\end{verbatim}
This will link your program with the double precision library. To link with the
single precision library, the link command is:
\begin{verbatim}
      $ LINK <prog>, NAGS_LIB/LIB
\end{verbatim}
and for the G\_Floating Library, the link command is:
\begin{verbatim}
      $ LINK <prog>, NAGG_LIB/LIB
\end{verbatim}

If you want to use one of the other libraries, use the appropriate logical
name as specified in Table~\ref{tab:logs}.

If you don't know what you are doing, proceed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Read the {\em Essential Introduction to the NAG Fortran Library} --- (see
 below).
\item Read the {\em Users' Note} --- (see below).
\item Try out the test described in the next section.
\end{itemize}

Now you will be ready to decide which routines to use. At this stage, your
primary documentation resources are:

\begin{itemize}
\item NAG Fortran Library Manual
\item NAG Fortran Library Introductory Guide
\end{itemize}

The Introductory Guide is best when deciding which routines to use. The Library
Manual is best when coding calls to NAG routines in your programs. If you still
have trouble after reading all this, look at the Error Bulletin for possible
known faults in the routines you are using. If this fails, contact the Starlink
Software Librarian at RAL (RLVAD::STAR), giving full details of your problem.
He may be able to solve it; otherwise, he will report it to NAG (see section
\ref{se:infodesk}).

Note in particular that when you use the double precision version of the
library, variables specified as {\em\bf real} should be specified in your
program as DOUBLE PRECISION; it is a common error to specify them as REAL.

\section{Selecting a version of the library}

The default version of the NAG library is the double precision version.
If you use the routine names specified in the NAG manual and link your program
with the NAG\_LIB library, this is the version you will use.

If you want to use the single precision version, you must change the routine
names by replacing the `F' at the end of the names by an `E', and
you must link your program with the single precision library NAGS\_LIB.

If you want to use the G precision version, use the same routine names as for
the double precision version, but link your program with the G
precision version of the library NAGG\_LIB and use the `/G\_FLOATING' qualifier
when compiling your program.

\section{Other NAG options and services}

At present, Starlink supplies its users with the following NAG products:

\begin{itemize}
\item The NAG Fortran Library in all precisions.
\item The NAG Graphics Library in all precisions.
\item The NAG On-line Information Supplement.
\item {\bf Genstat}, a general statistics package.
\item {\bf Toolpack/1}, a suite of Fortran 77 program development tools.
\end{itemize}

There are many other options and services offered by NAG which Starlink could
provide if there was a significant user demand. These are listed in the section
`Summary of Services' in the Introductory Guide.

The NAG Users Association holds a meeting once a year. This includes formal
technical presentations, software product demonstrations, workshops, and a user
forum. Starlink does not belong to it at present, but if a NAG enthusiast is
prepared to represent Starlink and attend and report on the meetings, this
could be changed; offers invited.

All these things cost money and effort, so you must make out a good case to the
Project Manager if you want Starlink to make them available.

\section{Software Distribution Procedure}

When a new Mark of the NAG library is released, RAL will receive tapes
containing the new libraries, together with updates for the NAG Fortran Library
Manual and a new Introductory Guide. RAL then distributes the libraries to the
other Starlink sites over the network as part of a Starlink Software Change
(SSC). New documentation updates are ordered independently for the other
Starlink sites. You can find out about recent NAG updates by examining
DOCSDIR:NEWS.LIS or the NAG entry in the Starlink Software Index
ADMINDIR:SSI.LIS.

\section{Example --- Test Program}
\label{se:exa}

A simple example of how to use a NAG library subroutine is given in the test
program which is stored as {\tt NAGDIR:TEST\_F01ACF.FOR} (double precision) or 
{\tt NAGSDIR:TEST\_F01ACE.FOR} (single precision). The input data files are
{\tt NAGDIR:TEST\_F01ACF.DAT} or  {\tt NAGSDIR:TEST\_F01ACE.DAT}, and example
results are stored in {\tt NAGDIR:TEST\_F01ACF.RES} or 
{\tt NAGSDIR:TEST\_F01ACE.RES}.

The source for the double precision example is:

The data file for the double precision example is:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim} 
\end{small}

The examples can be executed from your private directory by executing the
statement:
\begin{verbatim} 
      $ @NAGDIR:TEST_F01ACF
\end{verbatim} 
for double precision or:
\begin{verbatim} 
      $ @NAGSDIR:TEST_F01ACE
\end{verbatim} 
for single precison. The statements execute a command prcedure which compiles,
links and runs the relevent test program. The double precison command procedure
is:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}

When executed, the example programs will display their test results on your
terminal, followed by the example results file. The double precision example
will produce output thus:

If this does not work, it could be that the example data file has the wrong
protection. This should be (RE,RWED,RE,RWE). If this is wrong, ask your Site

      1.1. Structure of the Library                                               
                                                                                  
        The NAG Fortran Library is a comprehensive collection of Fortran 77       
        routines for the solution of numerical and statistical problems. The      
        word `routine' is used to denote `subroutine' or `function'.              
                                                                                  
        The Library is divided into chapters, each devoted to a branch of         
        numerical analysis or statistics. Each chapter has a three-character      
        name and a title, e.g.                                                    
                                                                                  
          D01 - Quadrature                                                        
                                                                                  
        Exceptionally two chapters (H and S) have one-character names. (The       
        chapters and their names are based on the ACM modified SHARE              
        classification index [1].)                                                
                                                                                  
        All documented routines in the Library have six-character names,          
        beginning with the characters of the chapter name, e.g. D01AJF Note       
        that the second and third characters are digits, not letters; e.g. 0      
        is the digit zero, not the letter O. The last letter of each routine      
        name always appears as `F' in the documentation, but may be changed to    
        `E' in some single-precision implementations (see Section 1.6).           
                                                                                  
      1.2. Structure of the Manual                                                
                                                                                  
        The NAG Fortran Library Manual is the principal documentation for the     
        NAG Fortran Library. It has the same chapter structure as the Library:    
        each chapter of routines in the Library has a corresponding chapter       
        (of the same name) in the Manual. The chapters occur in alphanumeric      
        order. General introductory documents and indexes are placed at the       
        beginning of the Manual.                                                  
                                                                                  
        Each chapter consists of the following documents:                         
                                                                                  
          Chapter Introduction, e.g. Introduction - D01;                          
          Chapter Contents, e.g. Contents - D01;                                  
                                                                                  
        routine documents, one for each documented routine in the chapter. A      
        routine document has the same name as the routine which it describes.     
        Within each chapter, routine documents occur in alphanumeric order.       
        Exceptionally, some chapters (F06, X01, X02), which contain simple        
        support routines, do not have individual routine documents; instead,      
        all the routines are described together in the Chapter Introduction.      
                                                                                  
        The Manual has been typeset using the typesetting system TSSD [6].        
                                                                                  
      1.3. Supplementary Documentation                                            
                                                                                  
        In addition to the full Manual, NAG provides the following alternative    
        forms of documentation, which may be more convenient to use, but do       
        not contain all the information and advice which is provided in the       
        full Manual:                                                              
                                                                                  
        - the Introductory Guide                                                  
        - the Concise Reference                                                   
        - the On-line Information Supplement                                      
                                                                                  
        All these forms of documentation follow the same basic structure          
        (ordering, division into chapters) as the Manual. Further details of      
        their contents are given in Section 3.7.                                  
                                                                                  
      1.4. Marks of the Library                                                   
                                                                                  
        Periodically a new Mark of the NAG Fortran Library is released: new       
        routines are added, corrections or improvements are made to existing      
        routines; occasionally routines are withdrawn if they have been           
        superseded by improved routines.                                          
                                                                                  
        At each Mark, the documentation of the Library is updated. You must       
        make sure that your documentation has been updated to the same Mark as    
        the Library software that you are using.                                  
                                                                                  
        Marks are numbered, e.g. 12, 13, 14. The current Mark is 15.              
                                                                                  
        The Library software may be updated between Marks to an intermediate      
        maintenance level, in order to incorporate corrections. Maintenance       
        levels are indicated by a letter following the Mark number, e.g. 15A,     
        15B, and so on (Mark 15 documentation supports all these maintenance      
        levels).                                                                  
                                                                                  
      1.5. Implementations of the Library                                         
                                                                                  
        The NAG Fortran Library is available on many different computer           
        systems. For each distinct system, an implementation of the Library is    
        prepared by NAG, e.g. the Cray XMP Unicos implementation. The             
        implementation is distributed to sites as a tested compiled library.      
                                                                                  
        An implementation is usually specific to a range of machines (e.g. the    
        DEC VAX range); it may also be specific to a particular operating         
        system, Fortran compiler, or compiler option (e.g. scalar or vector       
        mode).                                                                    
                                                                                  
        Essentially the same facilities are provided in all implementations of    
        the Library, but, because of differences in arithmetic behaviour and      
        in the compilation system, routines cannot be expected to give            
        identical results on different systems, especially for sensitive          
        numerical problems.                                                       
                                                                                  
        The documentation supports all implementations of the Library, with       
        the help of a few simple conventions, and a small amount of               
        implementation-dependent information, which is published in a separate    
        Users' Note for each implementation (see Section 3.4).                    
                                                                                  
      1.6. Precision of the Library                                               
                                                                                  
        The NAG Fortran Library is developed in both single precision and         
        double precision versions. REAL variables and arrays in the single        
        precision version are replaced by DOUBLE PRECISION variables and arrays   
        in the double precision version.                                          
                                                                                  
        On most systems only one precision of the Library is available; the       
        precision chosen is that which is considered most suitable in general     
        for numerical computation (double precision on most systems).             
                                                                                  
        On some systems both precisions are provided: in this case, the double    
        precision routines have names ending in `F' (as in the documentation),    
        and the single precision routines have names ending in `E'. Thus in       
        DEC VAX/VMS implementations:                                              
                                                                                  
          D01AJF is a routine in the double precision implementation;             
                                                                                  
          D01AJE is the corresponding routine in the single precision             
                 implementation.                                                  
                                                                                  
      1.7. Library Identification                                                 
                                                                                  
        You must know 4 which implementation, which precision 3 and 4 which       
        Mark 3 of the Library you are using or intend to use. To find out         
        which implementation, precision and Mark of the Library is available      
        at your site, you can run a program which calls the NAG Library           
        routine A00AAF (or A00AAE in some single precision implementations).      
        This routine has no parameters; it simply outputs text to the NAG         
        Library advisory message unit (see Section 2.4). An example of the        
        output is:                                                                
                                                                                  
          *** Start of NAG Library implementation details ***                     
          Implementation title: DEC VAX range (VAX/VMS)                           
                     Precision: FORTRAN double precision

                          Mark: 15A

        (The implementation code can be ignored, except possibly when             
        communicating with NAG; see Section 4.)                                   
                                                                                  
      1.8. Fortran Language Standards                                             
                                                                                  
        All routines in the Library conform to ANSI Standard Fortran 77 [8],      
        except for the use of a double precision complex data type (usually       
        COMPLEX*16) in some routines in double precision implementations of       
        the Library - there is no provision for this data type in the standard.   
                                                                                  
        Many of the routines in the Library were originally written to conform    
        to the earlier Fortran 66 standard [7], and their calling sequences       
        contain a few parameters which are not strictly necessary in Fortran      
        77.                                                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      2. Using the Library                                                        
                                                                                  
      2.1. General Advice                                                         
                                                                                  
        A NAG Fortran Library routine cannot be guaranteed to return              
        meaningful results, irrespective of the data supplied to it. Care and     
        thought must be exercised in:                                             
                                                                                  
        (a) formulating the problem;                                              
        (b) programming the use of library routines;                              
        (c) assessing the significance of the results.                            
                                                                                  
        The Foreword to the Manual provides some further discussion of points     
        (a) and (c); Sections 2.2 to 2.5 are concerned with (b).                  
                                                                                  
      2.2. Programming Advice                                                     
                                                                                  
        The NAG Fortran Library and its documentation are designed on the         
        assumption that users know how to write a calling program in Fortran.     
                                                                                  
        When programming a call to a routine, read the routine document           
        carefully, especially the description of the Parameters. This states      
        clearly which parameters must have values assigned to them on entry to    
        the routine, and which return useful values on exit. See Section 3.3      
        for further guidance.                                                     
                                                                                  
        The most common types of programming error in using the Library are:      
                                                                                  
        - incorrect parameters in a call to a Library routine;                    
        - calling a double precision implementation of the Library from a         
          single precision program, or vice versa.                                
                                                                                  
        Therefore if a call to a Library routine results in an unexpected         
        error message from the system (or possibly from within the Library),      
        check the following:                                                      
                                                                                  
          Has the NAG routine been called with the correct number of              
          parameters?                                                             
                                                                                  
          Do the parameters all have the correct type?                            
                                                                                  
          Have all array parameters been dimensioned correctly?                   
                                                                                  
          Is your program in the same precision as the NAG Library routines to    
          which your program is being linked?                                     
                                                                                  
          Have NAG routine names have been modified - if necessary - as           
          described in Sections 1.6 and 2.5?                                      
                                                                                  
        Avoid the use of NAG-type names for your own program units or COMMON      
        blocks: in general, do not use names which contain a three-character      
        NAG chapter name embedded in them; they may clash with the names of an    
        auxiliary routine or COMMON block used by the NAG Library.                
                                                                                  
      2.3. Error handling and the Parameter IFAIL                                 
                                                                                  
        NAG Fortran Library routines may detect various kinds of error,           
        failure or warning conditions. Such conditions are handled in a           
        systematic way by the Library. They fall roughly into three classes:      
                                                                                  
          (i) an invalid value of a parameter on entry to a routine;              
         (ii) a numerical failure during computation (e.g. approximate            
              singularity of a matrix, failure of an iteration to converge);      
        (iii) a warning that although the computation has been completed, the     
              results cannot be guaranteed to be completely reliable.             
                                                                                  
        All three classes are handled in the same way by the Library, and are     
        all referred to here simply as errors.                                    
                                                                                  
        The error-handling mechanism uses the parameter IFAIL, which occurs in    
        the calling sequence of most NAG Library routines (almost always it is    
        the last parameter). IFAIL serves two purposes:                           
                                                                                  
         (i) it allows users to specify what action a Library routine should      
             take if it detects an error;                                         
        (ii) it reports the outcome of a call to a Library routine, either        
             success (IFAIL = 0) or failure (IFAIL 0, with different values       
             indicating different reasons for the failure, as explained in        
             Section 6 of the routine document).                                  
                                                                                  
        For the first purpose IFAIL must be assigned a value before calling       
        the routine; since IFAIL is reset by the routine, it must be passed as    
        a variable, not as an integer constant. Allowed values on entry are:      
                                                                                  
        IFAIL =  0: an error message is output, and execution is terminated       
                    (hard failure);                                               
                                                                                  
        IFAIL = +1: execution continues without any error message;                
                                                                                  
        IFAIL = -1: an error message is output, and execution continues. The      
                    settings IFAIL = 1 are referred to as `soft failure'.         
                                                                                  
        The safest choice is to set IFAIL to 0, but this is not always            
        convenient: some routines return useful results even though a failure     
        (in some cases merely a warning) is indicated. However, if IFAIL is       
        set to 1 on entry, it is essential for the program to test its value      
        on exit from the routine, and to take appropriate action.                 
                                                                                  
        The specification of IFAIL in Section 5 of a routine document suggests    
        a suitable setting of IFAIL for that routine.                             
                                                                                  
        For a full description of the error-handling mechanism, see Chapter       
        P01.                                                                      
                                                                                  
      2.4. Input/output in the Library                                            
                                                                                  
        Most NAG Library routines perform no output to an external file,          
        except possibly to output an error message. All error messages are        
        written to a logical error message unit. This unit number (which is       
        set by default to 6 in most implementations) can be changed by calling    
        the Library routine X04AAF.                                               
                                                                                  
        Some NAG Library routines may optionally output their final results,      
        or intermediate results to monitor the course of computation. All         
        output other than error messages is written to a logical advisory         
        message unit. This unit number (which is also set by default to 6 in      
        most implementations) can be changed by calling the Library routine       
        X04ABF. Although it is logically distinct from the error message unit,    
        in practice the two unit numbers may be the same.                         
                                                                                  
        All output from the Library is formatted.                                 
                                                                                  
        The only Library routines which perform input from an external file       
        are a few option-setting routines in Chapter E04: the unit number is a    
        parameter to the routine, and all input is formatted.                     
                                                                                  
        You must ensure that the relevant Fortran unit numbers are associated     
        with the desired external files, either by an OPEN statement in your      
        calling program, or by operating system commands.                         
                                                                                  
      2.5. Auxiliary Routines                                                     
                                                                                  
        In addition to those Library routines which are documented and are        
        intended to be called by users, the Library also contains many            
        auxiliary routines. Details of all the auxiliary routines which are       
        called directly or indirectly by any documented NAG Library routine,      
        are supplied to sites in machine-readable form with the Library           
        software.                                                                 
                                                                                  
        In general, you need not be concerned with them at all, although you      
        may be made aware of their existence if, for example, you examine a       
        memory map of an executable program which calls NAG routines. The only    
        exception is that when calling some NAG Library routines, you may be      
        required or allowed to supply the name of an auxiliary routine from       
        the NAG Library as an external procedure parameter. The routine           
        documents give the necessary details. In such cases, you only need to     
        supply the name of the routine; you never need to know details of its     
        parameter-list.                                                           
                                                                                  
        NAG auxiliary routines have names which are similar to the name of the    
        documented routine(s) to which they are related, but with last letter     
        `Z', `Y', and so on, e.g. D01BAZ is an auxiliary routine called by        
        D01BAF. In a single precision implementation in which the names of        
        documented routines end in `E', the names of auxiliary routines have      
        their first three and last three characters interchanged, e.g. BAZD01     
        is an auxiliary routine (corresponding to D01BAZ) called by D01BAE.       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      3. Using the Documentation                                                  
                                                                                  
      3.1. Using the Manual                                                       
                                                                                  
        The Manual is designed to serve the following functions:                  
                                                                                  
        - to give background information about different areas of numerical       
          and statistical computation;                                            
        - to advise on the choice of the most suitable NAG Library routine or     
          routines to solve a particular problem;                                 
        - to give all the information needed to call a NAG Library routine        
          correctly from a Fortran program, and to assess the results.            
                                                                                  
        At the beginning of the Manual are some general introductory              
        documents. The following may help you to find the chapter, and            
        possibly the routine, which you need to solve your problem:               
                                                                                  
          Contents Summary Mark 15 - a structured list of routines in the         
                                     Library, by chapter;                         
          KWIC Index               - a keyword index to chapters and routines;    
          GAMS Index               - a list of NAG routines classified            
                                     according to the GAMS scheme.                
                                                                                  
        Having found a likely chapter or routine, you should read the             
        corresponding Chapter Introduction, which gives background information    
        about that area of numerical computation, and recommendations on the      
        choice of a routine, including indices, tables or decision trees.         
                                                                                  
        When you have chosen a routine, you must consult the routine document.    
        Each routine document is essentially self-contained (it may contain       
        references to related documents). It includes a description of the        
        method, detailed specifications of each parameter, explanations of        
        each error exit, remarks on accuracy, and an example program to           
        illustrate the use of the routine.                                        
                                                                                  
      3.2. Structure of Routine Documents                                         
                                                                                  
        Note: at Mark 14 some changes were made to the style and appearance of    
        routine documents. If you have a Manual which contains pre-mark 14        
        routine documents, you will find that it contains older documents         
        which differ in style, although they contain essentially the same         
        information. Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5 of this Essential Introduction     
        describe the new-style routine documents. Section 3.8 gives some          
        details about the old-style documents.                                    
                                                                                  
        All routine documents have the same structure, consisting of nine         
        numbered sections:                                                        
                                                                                  
          1. Purpose                                                              
          2. Specification                                                        
          3. Description                                                          
          4. References                                                           
          5. Parameters (see Section 3.3 below)                                   
          6. Error Indicators                                                     
          7. Accuracy                                                             
          8. Further Comments                                                     
          9. Example    (see Section 3.5 below)                                   
                                                                                  
        In a few documents, Section 5 also includes a description of printed      
        output which may optionally be produced by the routine.                   
                                                                                  
      3.3. Specifications of Parameters                                           
                                                                                  
        Section 5 of each routine document contains the specification of the      
        parameters, in the order of their appearance in the parameter list.       
                                                                                  
      3.3.1.  Classification of parameters                                        
                                                                                  
        Parameters are classified as follows:                                     
                                                                                  
          Input: you must assign values to these parameters on or before entry    
          to the routine, and these values are unchanged on exit from the routine.
                                                                                  
          Output: you need not assign values to these parameters on or before     
          entry to the routine; the routine may assign values to them.            
                                                                                  
          Input/Output: you must assign values to these parameters on or          
          before entry to the routine, and the routine may then change these      
          values.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          Workspace: array parameters which are used as workspace by the          
          routine. You must supply arrays of the correct type and dimension,      
          but you need not be concerned with their contents.                      
                                                                                  
          External Procedure: a subroutine or function which must be supplied     
          (e.g. to evaluate an integrand or to print intermediate output).        
          Usually it must be supplied as part of your calling program, in         
          which case its specification includes full details of its               
          parameter-list and specifications of its parameters (all enclosed in    
          a box). Its parameters are classified in the same way as those of       
          the Library routine, but because you must write the procedure rather    
          than call it, the significance of the classification is different:      
                                                                                  
            Input: values may be supplied on entry, which your procedure must     
            not change.                                                           
                                                                                  
            Output: you may or must assign values to these parameters before      
            exit from your procedure.                                             
                                                                                  
            Input/Output: values may be supplied on entry, and you may or must    
            assign values to them before exit from your procedure.                
                                                                                  
          Occasionally, as mentioned in Section 2.5, the procedure can be        
          supplied from the NAG Library, and then you only need to know its name. 
                                                                                  
          User Workspace: array parameters which are passed by the Library        
          routine to an external procedure parameter. They are not used by the    
          routine, but you may use them to pass information between your          
          calling program and the external procedure.                             
                                                                                  
          Dummy: a simple variable which is not used by the routine. A            
          variable or constant of the correct type must be supplied, but its      
          value need not be set. (A dummy parameter is usually a parameter        
          which was required by an earlier version of the routine and is          
          retained in the parameter-list for compatibility.)                      
                                                                                  
      3.3.2. Constraints and suggested values                                     
                                                                                  
        The word `Constraint:' or `Constraints:' in the specification of an       
        Input parameter introduces a statement of the range of valid values       
        for that parameter, e.g.                                                  
                                                                                  
          Constraint: N > 0.                                                      
                                                                                  
        If the routine is called with an invalid value for the parameter (e.g.    
        N = 0), the routine will usually take an error exit, returning a          
        non-zero value of IFAIL (see Section 2.3).                                
                                                                                  
        In newer documents constraints on parameters of type CHARACTER only       
        list uppercase alphabetic characters, e.g.                                
                                                                                  
          Constraint: STRING = 'A' or 'B'.                                        
                                                                                  
        In practice all routines with CHARACTER parameters will permit the use    
        of lower case characters.                                                 
                                                                                  
        The phrase `Suggested Value:' introduces a suggestion for a reasonable    
        initial setting for an Input parameter (e.g. accuracy or maximum          
        number of iterations) in case you are unsure what value to use; you       
        should be prepared to use a different setting if the suggested value      
        turns out to be unsuitable for your problem.                              
                                                                                  
      3.3.3. Array parameters                                                     
                                                                                  
        Most array parameters have dimensions which depend on the size of the     
        problem. In Fortran terminology they have `adjustable dimensions': the    
        dimensions occurring in their declarations are integer variables which    
        are also parameters of the Library routine.                               
                                                                                  
        For example, a Library routine might have the specification:              
                                                                                  
          SUBROUTINE <name> (M, N, A, B, LDB)                                     
          INTEGER       M, N, A(N), B(LDB,N), LDB                                 
                                                                                  
        For a one-dimensional array parameter, such as A in this example, the     
        specification would begin:                                                
                                                                                  
          A(N) - INTEGER array.                                                   
                                                                                  
        You must ensure that the dimension of the array, as declared in your      
        calling (sub)program, is at least as large as the value you supply for    
        N. It may be larger; but the routine uses only the first N elements.      
                                                                                  
        For a two-dimensional array parameter, such as B in the example, the      
        specification might be:                                                   
                                                                                  
          B(LDB,N) - INTEGER array.                                               
                                                                                  
            On entry: the m by n matrix B.                                        
                                                                                  
        and the parameter LDB might be described as follows:                      
                                                                                  
          LDB - INTEGER.                                                 Input    
                                                                                  
            On entry: the first dimension of the array B as declared in the       
            (sub)program from which <name> is called.                             
                                                                                  
            Constraint: LDB  >= M.                                                
                                                                                  
        You must supply the first dimension of the array B, as declared in        
        your calling (sub)program, through the parameter LDB, even though the     
        number of rows actually used by the routine is determined by the          
        parameter M. You must ensure that the first dimension of the array is     
        at least as large as the value you supply for M. The extra parameter      
        LDB is needed because Fortran does not allow information about the        
        dimensions of array parameters to be passed automatically to a routine.   
                                                                                  
        You must also ensure that the second dimension of the array, as           
        declared in your calling (sub)program, is at least as large as the        
        value you supply for N. It may be larger, but the routine only uses       
        the first N columns.                                                      
                                                                                  
        A program to call the hypothetical routine used as an example in this     
        section might include the statements:                                     
                                                                                  
          INTEGER AA(100), BB(100,50)                                             
          LDB = 100                                                               
          .                                                                       
          .                                                                       
          .                                                                       
          M = 80                                                                  
          N = 20                                                                  
          CALL <name>(M,N,AA,BB,LDB)                                              
                                                                                  
        Fortran requires that the dimensions which occur in array                 
        declarations, must be greater than zero. Many NAG routines are            
        designed so that they can be called with a parameter like N in the        
        above example set to 0 (in which case they would usually exit             
        immediately without doing anything). If so, the declarations in the       
        Library routine would use the `assumed size' array dimension, and         
        would be given as:                                                        
                                                                                  
          INTEGER        M, N, A(*), B(LDB,*), LDB                                
                                                                                  
        However, the original declaration of an array in your calling program     
        must always have constant dimensions, greater than or equal to 1.         
                                                                                  
        Consult an expert or a textbook on Fortran, if you have difficulty in     
        calling NAG routines with array parameters.                               
                                                                                  
      3.4. Implementation-dependent Information                                   
                                                                                  
        In order to support all implementations of the Library, the Manual has    
        adopted a convention of using bold italics to distinguish terms which     
        have different interpretations in different implementations.              
                                                                                  
        The most important bold italicised terms are the following; their         
        interpretation depends on whether the implementation is in single         
        precision or double precision:                                            
                                                                                  
        real                  means  REAL              or  DOUBLE PRECISION       
        complex               means  COMPLEX           or  COMPLEX*16             
                                                           (or equivalent)        
        basic precision       means  single precision  or  double precision       
        additional precision  means  double precision  or  quadruple precision    
                                                                                  
        Another important bold italicised term is which denotes the relative      
        precision to which real floating-point numbers are stored in the          
        computer, e.g. in an implementation with approximately 16 decimal         
        digits of precision, has a value of approximately10**(-16).               
                                                                                  
        The precise value of is given by the function X02AJF. Other functions     
        in Chapter X02 return the values of other implementation-dependent        
        constants, such as the overflow threshold, or the largest                 
        representable integer. Refer to the X02 Chapter Introduction for more     
        details.                                                                  
                                                                                  
        For each implementation of the Library, a separate Users' Note is         
        published. This is a short document, revised at each Mark. At most        
        installations it is available in machine-readable form. It gives any      
        necessary additional information which applies specifically to that       
        implementation, in particular:                                            
                                                                                  
        - the interpretation of bold italicised terms;                            
        - the values returned by X02 routines;                                    
        - the default unit numbers for output (see Section 2.4);                  
        - details of name changes for Library routines (see Sections 1.6 and 2.5).
                                                                                  
      3.5. Example Programs and Results                                           
                                                                                  
        The example program in the last section of each routine document          
        illustrates a simple call of the routine. The programs are designed so    
        that they can fairly easily be modified, and so serve as the basis for    
        a simple program to solve a user's own problem.                           
                                                                                  
        Bold italicised terms are used in the printed text of the example         
        program, to denote precision-dependent features in the code. The          
        correct Fortran code must be substituted before the program can be        
        run. In addition to the terms real and complex which were explained in    
        Section 3.4, the following are used in the example programs:              
                                                                                  
        Intrinsic Functions: real  means REAL  or DBLE (see Note below)           
                             imag  means AIMAG or DIMAG                           
                             cmplx means CMPLX or DCMPLX                          
                             conjg means CONJG or DCONJG                          
        Edit Descriptor:     e     means E     or D    (in FORMAT statements)     
        Exponent Letter:     e     means E     or D    (in constants)             
                                                                                  
        Note: in some implementations, the intrinsic function real with a         
        complex argument must be interpreted as DREAL rather than DBLE.           
                                                                                  
        For each implementation of the Library, NAG distributes the example       
        programs in machine-readable form, with all necessary modifications       
        already applied. Many sites make the programs accessible in this form     
        to users.                                                                 
                                                                                  
        Note that the results from running the example programs may not be        
        identical in all implementations, and may not agree exactly with the      
        results which are printed in the Manual and which were obtained from      
        an Apollo DN3000 double precision implementation (with approximately      
        16 digits of precision).                                                  
                                                                                  
        The Users' Note for your implementation will mention any special          
        changes which need to be made to the example programs, and any            
        significant differences in the results.                                   
                                                                                  
      3.6. Summary for New Users                                                  
                                                                                  
        If you are unfamiliar with the NAG Library and are thinking of using a    
        routine from it, please follow these instructions:                        
                                                                                  
        (a) read the whole of the Essential Introduction;                         
        (b) consult the Contents Summary or KWIC Index to choose an               
            appropriate chapter or routine;                                       
        (c) read the relevant Chapter Introduction;                               
        (d) choose a routine, and read the routine document. If the routine       
            does not after all meet your needs, return to steps (b) or (c);       
        (e) read the Users' Note for your implementation;                         
        (f) consult local documentation, which should be provided by your         
            local support staff, about access to the NAG Library on your          
            computing system.                                                     
                                                                                  
        You should now be in a position to include a call to the routine in a     
        program, and to attempt to run it. You may of course need to refer        
        back to the relevant documentation in the case of difficulties, for       
        advice on assessment of results, and so on.                               
                                                                                  
        As you become familiar with the Library, some of steps (a) to (f) can     
        be omitted, but it is always essential to:                                
                                                                                  
        - be familiar with the Chapter Introduction;                              
        - read the routine document;                                              
        - be aware of the Users' Note for your implementation.                    
                                                                                  
      3.7. Supplementary Documentation                                            
                                                                                  
        The Introductory Guide contains all the general introductory              
        documents, indexes, chapter introductions and chapter contents, from      
        the full Manual. It thus gives background information, and advice on      
        choosing the most suitable NAG Library routine; but it does not           
        contain any detailed specifications of the routines.                      
                                                                                  
        The Concise Reference contains details of the parameter-lists of all      
        routines in the Library, and very terse (usually one-line) summaries      
        of the specification of each parameter, and of the meaning of each        
        error-exit. It is not an adequate substitute for the documentation in     
        the full Manual, especially if you are trying to use a routine for the    
        first time, but it is intended to be a compact and convenient             
        memory-aid for users who have gained some familiarity with the Library.   
                                                                                  
        The On-line Information Supplement is a machine-based `Help' system,      
        which describes the subject areas covered by the Library, advises on      
        the choice of routines, and gives essential programming details for       
        each documented routine. It contains a machine-readable version of        
        Sections 1, 2, 5 and 6 of each routine document.                          
                                                                                  
        The On-Line Information Supplement is a separate product from the         
        Library: consult local documentation to see if it is available at your    
        site.                                                                     
                                                                                  
      3.8. Pre-Mark 14 Routine Documents                                          
                                                                                  
        You need only read this section if you have an updated Manual, which      
        contains pre-mark 14 documents.                                           
                                                                                  
        You will find that older routine documents appear in a somewhat           
        different style, or even several styles if your Manual dates back to      
        Mark 7, say. The following are the most important differences between     
        the earlier styles and the new style introduced at Mark 14:               
                                                                                  
        - before Mark 12, routine documents had 13 sections: the extra            
          sections have either been dropped or merged with the present            
          Section 8 (Further Comments);                                           
                                                                                  
        - in Section 5, parameters were not classified as Input, Output and so    
          on; the phrase `Unchanged on exit' was used to indicate an input        
          parameter;                                                              
                                                                                  
        - example programs were revised at Mark 12 and again at Mark 14, to       
          take advantage of features of Fortran 77: the programs printed in       
          older documents do not correspond exactly with those which are now      
          distributed to sites in machine-readable form;                          
                                                                                  
        - before Mark 12, the printed example programs did not use bold           
          italicised terms; they were written in standard single precision        
          Fortran;                                                                
                                                                                  
        - before Mark 9, the printed example results were generated on an ICL     
          1906A (with approximately 11 digits of precision), and between Marks    
          9 and 12 they were generated on an ICL 2900 (with approximately 16      
          digits of precision);                                                   
                                                                                  
        - before Mark 13, documents referred to `the appropriate implementation   
          document'; this means the same as the `Users' Note for your             
          implementation'.                                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      4. Contact between Users and NAG                                            
                                                                                  
        For further advice or communication about the NAG Library, you should     
        first turn to the staff of your local computer installation. This         
        covers such matters as:                                                   
                                                                                  
        - obtaining a copy of the Users' Note for your implementation;            
        - obtaining information about local access to the Library;                
        - seeking advice about using the Library;                                 
        - reporting suspected errors in routines or documents;                    
        - making suggestions for new routines or features;                        
        - purchasing NAG documentation.                                           
                                                                                  
        Your installation may have advisory and/or information services to        
        handle such enquiries. In addition NAG asks each installation mounting    
        the Library to nominate a NAG site representative, who may be             
        approached directly in the absence of an advisory service. Site           
        representatives receive information from NAG about confirmed errors,      
        the imminence of updates, and so on, and will forward users' enquiries    
        to the appropriate person in the NAG organisation if they cannot be       
        dealt with locally. If you are unable to make contact with your local     
        site representative, you should write to the address given in the         
        Users' Note or to the address given at the head of the Library Manual.    
                                                                                  
      5. Further Information                                                      
                                                                                  
        In the NAG Fortran Library Manual, the document Development of NAG        
        gives general information about the NAG project, while Summary of         
        Services gives details of other NAG products and services, including      
        numerical subroutine libraries in Ada, Pascal and Algol 68.               
                                                                                  
        In addition, references [2], [3], [4], and [5] discuss various aspects    
        of the design and development of the NAG Library, and NAG's technical     
        policies and organisation.

         This document is essential reading for every user of the NAG           
         Fortran Library Implementation specified in the title. It provides     
         implementation-specific detail that augments the information           
         provided in the NAG Fortran Library Manual and Introductory Guide.     
         Wherever those manuals refer to the "Users' Note for your              
         implementation", the user should consult this note. A tabbed divider   
         has been provided near the beginning of Volume 1 of the NAG Fortran    
         Library Manual, indicating a suitable place to store the document,     
         should you so wish.                                                    
                                                                                
         NAG recommends that users read the following minimum reference

         of each of the above. Please ask your NAG Site Contact for further     
         information.                                                           
                                                                                
      2. Availability of Routines                                               
                                                                                
         All routines listed in the chapter contents documents of the NAG       
         Fortran Library Manual, Mark 15 are available in this implementation.  
         At Mark 15, 167 new primary ('user-callable') routines have been       
         introduced, and 11 deleted. Please consult the document FORTRAN        
         MARK 15 NEWS in the manual for lists of these routines and for a list  
         of routines scheduled for withdrawal at Mark 16 or later. The file     
         NEWS supplied to your site on the library distribution medium (see     
         Section 3.5) also gives an outline of the new material available.      
                                                                                
      3. General Information                                                    
                                                                                
      3.1. Accessing the Library                                                
                                                                                
           To compile a Fortran program, type                                   
                                                                                
               FORTRAN <program>                                                
                                                                                
           where <program> is the name of a .FOR file containing your           
           program.                                                             
                                                                                
           To link a program with the NAG Library, assuming that the logical    
           name NAG has been set up, type                                       
                                                                                
               LINK <program>,NAG/LIB                                           
                                                                                
           where <program> is the name of a .OBJ file containing your           
           compiled program.                                                    
                                                                                
           To run the program, type                                             
                                                                                
               ASSIGN <data>    FOR005                                          
               ASSIGN <results> FOR006                                          
               RUN <program>                                                    
                                                                                
           where <program> is the name of a .EXE file containing your linked    
           program, <data> is data to be read from Fortran channel 5, and       
           <results> are results to be written to Fortran channel 6.            
                                                                                
      3.2. Interpretation of Bold Italicised Terms                              
                                                                                
           For this double precision implementation, the bold italicised        
           terms used in the NAG Fortran Library Manual (and shown here         
           as //.....// ) should be interpreted as:                             
                                                                                
           //real//                 - DOUBLE PRECISION (REAL*8)                 
           //basic precision//      - double precision                          
           //complex//              - COMPLEX*16                                
           //additional precision// - quadruple precision (REAL*16)             
           //machine precision//    - the machine precision, see the value      
                                      returned by X02AJF in Section 4, below.   
                                                                                
           Thus a parameter described as //real// should be declared as         
           DOUBLE PRECISION in the user's program. If a routine                 
           accumulates an inner product in //additional precision//, it         
           is using software to simulate quadruple precision.                   
                                                                                
           In routine documents that have been newly typeset since Mark 12      
           additional bold italicised terms are used in the published           
           example programs and they must be interpreted as follows:            
                                                                                
           //real// as an intrinsic function name - DBLE                        
           //imag//                               - DIMAG                       
           //cmplx//                              - DCMPLX                      
           //conjg//                              - DCONJG                      
           //e// in constants, e.g. 1.0//e//-4    - D, e.g. 1.0D-4              
           //e// in formats, e.g. //e//12.4       - D, e.g. D12.4               
                                                                                
           All references to routines in Chapter F07 - Linear Equations         
           (LAPACK) use the LAPACK name, not the NAG F07 name. The LAPACK       
           name is precision dependent, and hence the name appears in a bold    
           italicised typeface.                                                 
                                                                                
           The typeset examples use the single precision form of the LAPACK     
           name. To convert this name to its double precision form, change the  
           first character either from S to D or C to Z as appropriate.         
           For example:                                                         
                                                                                
           //sgetrf// refers to the LAPACK routine name - DGETRF                
           //cpotrs//                                   - ZPOTRS                
                                                                                
      3.3. Example Programs                                                     
                                                                                
           In the NAG Fortran Library Manual, routine documents that have       
           been typeset since Mark 12 present the example programs in a         
           generalised form, using bold italicised terms as described in        
           Section 3.2.                                                         
                                                                                
           In other routine documents, the example programs are in              
           single precision and require modification for use with double        
           precision routines. This conversion can entail:                      
                                                                                
           - Changing REAL or COMPLEX type specifications to REAL*8 or          
             COMPLEX*16;                                                        
                                                                                
           - Changing certain intrinsic function references, e.g. REAL or       
             FLOAT to DBLE, ALOG to DLOG, CMPLX to DCMPLX, and so on;           
                                                                                
           - Changing real constants to double precision form, e.g. 0.1         
             or 0.1E0 to 0.1D0.                                                 
                                                                                
           The example programs supplied to a site in machine-readable          
           form have been modified as necessary so that they are suitable       
           for immediate execution. Note that all the distributed example       
           programs have been revised and do not correspond exactly with the    
           programs published in the manual, unless the documents have been     
           recently typeset. The distributed example programs should be used    
           in preference wherever possible.                                     
                                                                                
      3.4. Explicit Output from NAG Routines                                    
                                                                                
           Certain routines produce explicit error messages and advisory        
           messages via output units which either have default values or        
           can be reset by using X04AAF for error messages and X04ABF for       
           advisory messages. (The default values are given in Section 4).      
           The maximum record lengths of error messages and advisory            
           messages (including carriage control characters) are 80              
           characters, except where otherwise specified.

           NEWS     - an outline of the new and enhanced routines available     
                      at Mark 15                                                
           REPLACED - a list of routines available at earlier Marks of the      
                      Library but since withdrawn, together with recommended    
                      replacements                                              
           CALLS    - a list of routines called directly or indirectly by       
                      each routine in the library, and by each example program  
           CALLED   - for each routine in the library (including auxiliaries)   
                      this gives a list of those routines and example programs  
                      which call it directly or indirectly.

             The following routines call the function X02CAF for an estimate    
             of the amount of actual (as opposed to virtual) store              
             available, in order to reduce the amount of paging when solving    
             large problems:

             The value of ACC, the machine-dependent constant mentioned in      
             several documents in the chapter is approximately 1.0D-13.

             On hard failure, P01ABF writes the error message                   
             to the error message unit specified by

                 and F04AZF. It does not affect the numerical results           
                 returned by those routines, but merely the amount of           
                 paging performed when using these routines to operate on       
                 large matrices when running on a paged system. The             
                 constant value returned by the version of X02CAF in the        
                 compiled library should give a performance close to the        
                 optimum in almost all circumstances, but users who wish        
                 to override this value (e.g. if their jobs are run in a        
                 special session with an untypically large amount of            
                 actual store available) may do so by supplying their own       
                 function of the same name, to be compiled and loaded with      
                 their main program. Such a function should have the form:

             Where a manual has been provided as part of the contract issue,    
             this manual is updated automatically at each new release of the    
             software, by the supply of a manual update set or a complete new   
             manual. If additional manuals have been ordered in the past        
             then updates to these manuals may be separately ordered. They      
             are NOT sent automatically. Additional complete manuals and the    
             manual updates (where relevant) are available at prices published  
             in the NAG documentation order form.

             - it gives key-word-driven guidance on the selection of the        
               appropriate NAG routine                                          
             - it gives abbreviated on-line documentation of the NAG routines,  
               to enable the user to call the routines and investigate any      
               IFAIL messages without recourse to the manual.

      MARK 15 NEWS                                                               
                                                                                 
      1. New Features of Mark 15                                                 
                                                                                 
        Mark 15 represents a further considerable expansion of the NAG Fortran   
        Library. It contains a total of 1045 documented routines, of which 167   
        are new at this Mark. Two new chapters have been introduced:             
                                                                                 
        F07 - Linear Equations (LAPACK)                                          
        G12 - Survival Analysis                                                  
                                                                                 
        Out of 167 new routines, 98 are in the new chapter F07. This new         
        chapter includes routines to compute factorizations, solutions, error    
        bounds and condition numbers for real and complex linear systems;        
        symmetric, Hermitian, positive-definite, general, band and triangular    
        systems are provided for.                                                
                                                                                 
        35 of the new routines are in the Statistics chapters. They include      
        facilities (in the stated chapters) for:                                 
                                                                                 
        - further statistical distribution functions (G01)                       
        - factor analysis and discriminant analysis (G03)                        
        - improved random number generators (G05)                                
        - computation of confidence intervals; maximum likelihood estimates      
          (G07)                                                                  
        - generation of a multivariate time series (G05)                         
        - forecasting from a vector autoregressive moving average model,         
          allowing for: transforming and/or differencing of a multivariate       
          time series; testing for stationarity and invertibility (G13)          
                                                                                 
        New routines have been introduced in other chapters of the Library       
        for:                                                                     
                                                                                 
        - solution of parabolic partial differential equations with coupled      
          differential algebraic systems (D03)                                   
        - solution of symmetric positive-definite Toeplitz systems (F04)         
        - computation of matrix norms for different types of matrix (F06)        
        - mixed integer LP (H)                                                   
        - special functions (S)                                                  
        - machine specific numbers (X02)                                         
                                                                                 
        For a number of existing routines (mainly in the linear algebra          
        chapters) the underlying code has been replaced by calls to the new      
        F07 routines or their auxiliaries. The modified versions can achieve     
        much better performance on some machines.                                
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
      2. New Routines                                                            
                                                                                 
        For details, please refer to the relevant chapter introductions and      
        routine documents. Routines in the F06 and X02 chapters are described    
        in the F06 and X02 Chapter Introductions; they do not have individual    
        routine documents. A concise summary of the purpose of all documented    
        routines in the Library is given in the document Contents Summary,       
        Mark 15 (with the exception of routines which have been superseded).     
                                                                                 
        The following 167 new routines are included in the NAG Fortran Library   
        at Mark 15:

        The following routines have been withdrawn from the NAG Fortran          
        Library at Mark 15. Warning of their withdrawal was included in the      
        Mark 14 Library Manual, together with advice on which routines to use    
        instead. The relevant Chapter Introduction documents give more           
        detailed guidance.

      4. Routines Scheduled for Withdrawal                                       
                                                                                 
        The routines listed below are scheduled for withdrawal from the NAG      
        Fortran Library, because improved routines have now been included in     
        the Library. Users are advised to stop using routines which are          
        scheduled for withdrawal immediately and to use recommended              
        replacement routines instead. The relevant chapter introduction          
        documents give further guidance, including detailed advice on how to     
        change a call to the old routine into a call to the new routine.         
                                                                                 
        The following routines will be withdrawn at Mark 16:

        The following routines have been superseded, but will not be withdrawn   
        from the Library until Mark 17 at the earliest. They are being           
        retained at Marks 15 and 16 because of their length of life in the       
        Library, and to give users a longer time to make the transition to the   
        new routines.

        The following routines have had underlying code replaced to call new     
        F07 routines or their auxiliaries. This has resulted in the addition     
        of new error exits from these routines.

        Some minor revisions have been made to routines for fast Fourier         
        transforms in Chapter C06, in order to improve their efficiency.

        Some minor revisions have been made to auxiliaries of routines solving   
        boundary value problems by shooting methods, namely D02HAF, D02HBF and   
        D02SAF, in order to improve reliability.

        improvement has been incorporated into G13DCF. The matrices computed     
        in the argument C of G13DAF and R of G13DSF now return the correct       
        results; previously they contained the transpose of the results.
