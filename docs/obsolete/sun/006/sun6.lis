               AATGS - Guide Probe Predictions for AAT
               ---------------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

AATGS is a version of the AAO program GS.  This note is a  preface  to
the  AAO  document, a copy of which is attached.  AATGS predicts guide
probe settings, given the celestial coordinates of  the  field  centre
and  of  a  guide  star,  for  the  guiding  systems  at the prime and
Cassegrain foci of the AAT.



2  OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

AATGS is intended to be run interactively via a terminal, but  can  be
run  with  specified  input and output files if this is required.  The
command is:

        $ AATGS  [input]  [report]

where both file identifiers would normally be omitted, to  default  to
terminal  operation.   The  parameters  may  be  defaulted  either  by
omission or by using the special code '.'.



3  CHANGES TO AAO VERSION

These notes refer to the attached  AAO  document,  most  of  which  no
longer applies and may be ignored.  The sections that still apply are:

        2.1.1 & 2.1.2  Dialogue & example.
        2.2.1  &  2.2.2  Details of batch operation (read 'input
                file' etc for 'card deck' etc.).
        3.  Limitations.
        4.  Internal description.  Only the architectural and
            trigonometric remarks apply to this version of the program.
