                    IUEDEARCH and access to IUE archive data

                    ----------------------------------------









          1  INTRODUCTION



          The IUE data archive is supported and maintained by  members

          of  the  UK  IUE  Project in the Space Science Department at

          RAL.  The archive  comprises  some  1000  tapes,  containing

          about  70000  images, and a catalogue which gives details of

          the exposures.  New images  are  continually  added  to  the

          archive  and  the catalogue is updated every month.  All IUE

          data are available to the astronomical community  about  six

          months  after  the  observations were made and appear in the

          catalogue a few months  before  release.   The  aim  of  the

          system  is to provide UK astronomers with quick and painless

          access  to  IUE  data.   This  document  describes  how   to

          interrogate the catalogue and extract data from the archive.

          There are also two other documents  relating  to  IUE  data.

          SUN/37  IUEDR - IUE data reduction package, describes how to

          extract spectra from IUE data files and SUN/20  ULDA/USSP  -

          Accessing  the  IUE  ULDA, describes a subsiduary archive of

          extracted low resolution spectra.



          Access to the IUE archive is possible  through  the  captive

          IUE  account  on  the  database machine at RAL and through a

          small number of global commands which  may  be  issued  from

          your  own  username.   From  the  captive  IUE account it is

          possible to interrogate the IUE catalogue, issue dearchiving

          requests  and  use  some  other facilities.  The dearchiving

          program copies the required files from archive tapes  to  an

          output  tape  and  runs on the IBM at RAL (RL.IB) as a batch

          program under MVS.  Before using  the  package  ensure  that

          @NET$DIR:NETSYMB is included in your LOGIN.COM file.  To run

          the dearchiving program  remotely  and  to  use  FTP  it  is

          necessary  to be connected to the boot node of your cluster.

          The following sections contain details on

          2  THE IUE CAPTIVE ACCOUNT.



          The IUE captive  account  is  a  username  on  the  database

          machine  at  RAL  (STADAT::IUE)  which  anyone  may  use for

          accessing the IUE data archive.  All aspects of the  archive

          may  be  used  from  the  captive  account,  however,  it is

          recommended that dearchiving requests are issued  from  your

          own  username  using  one  of  the global commands described

          below.  Access to the IUE catalogue is possible only through

          the  captive  account.   To use the captive account login to

          your own username on a STARLINK node and then



                $ SET HOST STADAT



          and login to username IUE (no password  is  required).   You

          are  asked  for  a  name which is used for a subdirectory to

          contain your files and then the system displays  a  list  of

          options.   These  give  access to the catalogue, dearchiving

          and other facilities, and enable a few DCL  commands  to  be

          issued.  These options are:



          1.  HELP  -  An  online  help  facility  which  gives  brief

              descriptions of how to use the various options in IUE.



          2.  MAIL - Gives access to the VMS mail facility.



          3.  IUEDEARCH - Runs the  dearchiving  program  for  copying

              data onto magnetic tapes.



          4.  IUELOG - Searches the IUE catalogue.



          5.  CLASSKEY - Displays a list of the various classification

              codes used in the IUE catalogue.



          6.  TYPE - Same as the DCL command 'TYPE'.  It can  be  used

              to  view  any  of  the files in the IUE directory.  Wild

              card characters can not be used in the TYPE command.



          7.  DIR - Displays the contents of the  IUE  directory.   It

              may be used with the same options as the DCL equivalent.





                                   - 2 -


SUN/58.5                                                             Page 3





          8.  TRANS -  Files  which  have  been  created  in  the  IUE

              directory   can  be  transferred  to  one  of  your  own

              directories with this option.  You will be prompted  for

              your username, password, VAX mnemonic, the directory you

              wish the files to be transferred to, and the file  name.

              Wild  card  characters  may  be  used in the filename to

              allow several versions of a file to  be  transferred  at

              once.



          9.  PRINT - Obtains a  hard  copy  of  a  file  in  the  IUE

              directory  on  RLVAD  SYS$PRINTER.  Wild card characters

              may not be used when using this option.



         10.  SUBMIT - Resubmit a job.



         11.  DESPATCH - Request your output WDCnnn tape to be sent to

              you.



         12.  BETA - Calculates beta  and  other  angles  for  targets

              observed with IUE.



         13.  LOG - End the session and log-out.



          Any file you create in the IUE  directory  will  be  deleted

          automatically  after  two weeks.  If you wish to keep a file

          for longer than this it must be transferred to one  of  your

          own directories using MAIL or TRANS.







          3  GLOBAL COMMANDS



          The intention is to replace the captive IUE account (as much

          as  possible)  with global commands which may be issued from

          your own username on your local STARLINK node.   To  set  up

          the appropriate symbols include



                $ @STADAT::DISK$STARDATA:[IUES.CAPACCNT]REMOTESTART



          in your LOGIN.COM.  The commands currently available are



                $ IUEHELP - brief outline of the remote commands



                $ IUENEWS - any news of log updates etc



                and

                $ IUEDEARCH



                $ IUERESUBMIT



                $ IUEDESPATCH





                                   - 3 -


SUN/58.5                                                             Page 4





          which are described in detail in  the  appropriate  sections

          below.







          4  CONSULTING THE CATALOGUE



          At present consulting the  catalogue  is  possible  only  by

          accessing  the  IUE  captive  account.   Having  logged into

          STADAT::IUE, see section 2 which describes how to  do  this,

          select the IUELOG option.  You are prompted for a name which

          acts as an identifier for your files.  You will  first  want

          to  search  the MAIN catalogue and create work files.  These

          may also be searched and refined to  provide  the  list  you

          want.   Any of the work files may be kept (KEEP) and will be

          saved as identifier.IUE files.  Initially these  are  in  RA

          order but it is possible to sort (ORDER) them by either date

          or camera and image number.   All  the  KEEPed  and  ORDERed

          files    are    saved    as    different    generations   of

          [IUE]identifier.IUE where the identifier  is  the  name  you

          gave  at  the start.  The identifier.IUE files may be MAILed

          or transfered by FTP using the  TRANS  option  to  your  own

          username.







          5  ALLOCATING A TAPE TO CONTAIN YOUR DATA



          Before dearchiving IUE images it is  necessary  to  allocate

          yourself  an output data tape.  At present allocating a tape

          is possible only from the IUE captive  account.   Login  and

          select  the  ALLOCATE  option.   In  response to the prompts

          select either 16 or 62 for a 1600 or 6250  bpi  tape.   Give

          your  name  and  address.   The  name  of  the  tape will be

          selected automatically and is of the form WDCnnn.  The tapes

          are all NL (no label).







          6  DEARCHIVING IMAGES



          6.1  Preparing and Submitting the job



          First allocate yourself a tape.  IUEDEARCH can only  be  run

          from  a  machine  that has both a link to JANET and a DECnet

          connection to Starlink.  Dearchiving jobs may  be  submitted

          from  the IUE captive account using the IUEDEARCH option but

          the prefered way is from your own username using the  global

          command



                $ IUEDEARCH





                                   - 4 -


SUN/58.5                                                             Page 5





          If IUEDEARCH is not recognized, contact  your  site  manager

          and  RLVAD::IUES.   In  both  cases  the program appears the

          same.  You will be prompted for the following:



          1.  Your name (surname first, then your initials).



          2.  Name of your establishment (one line).



          3.  Your output tape name, density and label (type as  shown

              by the prompt; one space between each field).



          4.  A code for type of file required (ie GPHOT image  or/and

              EXTRACTED  etc).   If you do not know the code, type "?"

              for a list.  Some information relating to the  image  is

              available in a more understandable form in the header of

              the EXTRACTED spectrum, so for  HIRES  it  is  usual  to

              dearchive the G/PHOT and the EXTRACTED files.



          5.  Number of first file on output tape.  If you have copied

              10 files on this tape previously, you would type 11.



          6.  If you type a number other than 1 in step 5, you will be

              asked  to  give  the  length of tape already used.  This

              information is given in REQU.FIL of  the  previous  job;

              see  below.   The  program  keeps track of the length of

              output tape used, so the tape is  used  efficiently  and

              the IBM job should not crash when the tape is full.



          7.  Camera name and image number of the required  data.   No

              space  is needed between the camera and image number, eg

              LWR123, or LWR1234, or LWR12345 will work.



          8.  Check that the object identification is correct.  Repeat

              for the required images and enter END to finish.



          9.  VAX username.



         10.  VAX password.



         11.  Your VAX NRS name.  A list is available in  the  program

              and SUN/36.



          IUEDEARCH has a list of bad archive tapes,  ie  tapes  which

          cannot  be  used to retrieve data for one reason or another,

          and copying will not be attempted from such tapes.  It  also

          checks   the  release  date  of  all  images  requested,  to

          safeguard the data.



          Alternatively, the program will stop when it estimates  that

          the  output  tape  will be filled by the data, or when there

          are eighteen archive tapes required, as this is the  maximum

          number the IBM can process at one time.



                                   - 5 -


SUN/58.5                                                             Page 6





          Your VAX username, password and NRS name are required by FTP

          to  enable  the  output  of the IBM job to be routed back to

          your node and placed in your directory.



          By this time you will have created two new files; IUEWDC.JCL

          and  REQU.FIL.  The former is a batch job which is submitted

          to the IBM at your request,  and  you  should  remember  the

          generation  number  in case it needs to be resubmitted.  The

          latter contains the list of images you  requested.   If  you

          realise  that  an  error has been made, you can stop the job

          from being submitted by replying 'N' to the prompt  at  this

          stage.   A  copy of REQU.FIL is sent to the IUE data archive

          for dearchiving statistics, and so you may be notified  when

          any  bad  tapes  you  required  are  replaced.  If you get a

          message TRANSFER NOT KNOWN, it probably  means  you  do  not

          have  @NET$DIR:NETSYMB in your LOGIN.COM file.  The order of

          the files on the tape may be different  from  the  order  in

          which  you  entered  them.  This is to ensure that files are

          copied from the archive tapes in an efficient way.







          6.2  Waiting for the Job to run.



          Turnaround time for the IBM job is usually a few  hours  and

          if  it  takes much longer than this contact RLVAD::IUES.  If

          you have access to CMS at RAL, you can check the progress of

          your  job  by  logging  in  and  typing JSTAT AMWDCnnn where

          WDCnnn is your output tape.  Do not submit a new  job  using

          the same output tape until you are sure the previous job has

          finished.







          6.3  Output from IUEDEARCH



          The output of the IBM job should appear  in  a  file  called

          WDCnnn.OUT within a few hours.  It contains several pages of

          the IBM log file and then for each file that has been copied

          five  lines  from  the  image header for identification.  If

          this file appears almost immediately then most probably  the

          job  has  been  rejected.  You should examine the output for

          errors (see section 7) and if necessary report any  problems

          with  a copy of the WDCnnn.OUT file to RLVAD::IUES.  If your

          output does not appear within a day or so  you  should  also

          report  it.   Your  output tape is retained at RAL until you

          request it so you may append data from  further  dearchiving

          jobs.   Finally  be  aware  that  the  output  file  in your

          directory (WDCnnn.OUT) is overwritten every time a job using

          the same output tape is submitted.

SUN/58.5                                                             Page 7





          6.4  When things go wrong



          If a job is rejected immediately and the problem appears  to

          be  with  the  IBM  tape  management  system  (TDMS, see the

          section on errors) then resubmit the  job  perhaps  an  hour

          later.   If  most  of the file copying is successful but for

          various reasons some files are not copied correctly then  do

          not  resubmit  the  whole  job  again  but  re-dearchive the

          missing images.  If some files still refuse to be copied  or

          it  is  not  clear  why  the  job  has  failed then send the

          WDCnnn.OUT file to RLVAD::IUES.







          6.5  Submitting another Job.



          Now that you have checked the job has run and inspected  the

          output in your files, you may if you wish run another job to

          copy a further set of files to the same  output  tape.   You

          will  need  to  know  the number of files on the tape and an

          estimate of the amount  of  tape  used,  from  the  previous

          REQU.FIL.   Do  not submit another job using the same output

          tape until you  have  checked  that  the  previous  one  has

          finished.    Remember  that  the  WDCnnn.OUT  file  will  be

          overwritten.







          7  RESUBMITTING A JOB.



          Sometimes the file transfer to the IBM is not successful for

          example  if  the network is down.  You will then be informed

          by the FTP system; it retries  a  limited  number  of  times

          automatically before giving up and it informs you each time.

          You can resubmit the job later when the network is  working,

          without  going  through IUEDEARCH again.  There may be other

          circumstances when the job as submitted is  correct  but  it

          has  failed, perhaps because of operator error.  To resubmit

          a job use the global command



                $ IUERESUBMIT generation_number



          As  your  directory  may  contain  several  generations   of

          WDCIUE.JCL it is important that you are sure of which one to

          submit.  If the generationnumber is omitted IUERESUBMIT will

          in  the  first instance assume you wish to resubmit the most

          recent version of WDCIUE.JCL but  you  may  change  this  or

          escape  at  the  prompts.   If you are using the IUE captive

          account use the SUBMIT option.

          8  DESPATCHING THE TAPE



          When you have all the required data on tape you may  request

          the tape to be despatched to you by using the global command



                $ IUEDESPATCH tapename



          or the DESPATCH option from the IUE captive  account,  which

          send  a standard message to RLVAD::IUES.  If the tapename is

          omitted  it  is  prompted  for.   Your  tape  will  then  be

          despatched   to   you  by  post  and  you  will  receive  an

          acknowledgement that it has been sent.







          9  ERROR MESSAGES



          Various  error  messages  may  be   issued   to   the   user

          interactively  during  the  running  of  the layout program.

          Most  of  these  errors  are  not  fatal  and  the   program

          continues.   These messages and the actions taken are listed

          below.  This section also includes  IBM  errors  and  ABENDS

          which  may  appear in the log section of the output file and

          finally some examples of output.







          9.1  Fatal Errors





           o  INDEX.DAT file is write locked.



              Terminates program and users should run IUEDEARCH later,

              (update of the index is in progress).



           o  **DIMENSION OF BADTAPE FILE, FILE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED**



              Terminates program and users should contact  RLVAD::IUES

              to rectify the problem.



           o  /TRANSFER/ unrecognized command



              Terminates the program and users should ensure that they

              have @NET$DIR:NETSYMB in their LOGIN.COM file.









          9.2  Non-fatal Errors

           o  **OUTPUT TAPE IS FULL**



              Continues the program but no more images can be copied.



           o  **NO MORE TAPES CAN BE PROCESSED**



              Continues the program but no more images can be copied.



           o  **NO MORE THAN A 100 IMAGES CAN BE PROCESSED**



              Continues the program but no more images can be copied.



          In these 3 cases, the  last  requested  image  will  not  be

          copied.







          9.3  IBM Job Errors and ABENDS



          Various error messages and abends may show up on your output

          (WDCnnn.OUT)  file.  Some of these error messages and abends

          are listed below:



           o  ABEND S222



              Job cancelled,  usually  due  to  exceeding  output,  ie

              output  tape  is  full or the number of lines on the IBM

              output exceeded the default limit.   Rerun  the  program

              for the images not copied on another output tape.



           o  ABEND S322



              Job step exceeded its CPU time limit.  Rerun the program

              for images not copied.



           o  ABEND S337



              Your output tape is full.  Rerun  the  program  for  the

              images not copied using another tape.



           o  ABEND S522



              Wait time limited exceeded.  Resubmit the job.



           o  ABEND 613/A13



              File on output tape not found.   Check  the  first  file

              number  on  your output tape and resubmit.  If job fails

              again  with  the  same  error,  send  output   file   to

              RLVAD::IUES.

           o  "Index Error"



              This may occur on your output file.  If  it  occurs  for

              ONE  IMAGE  ONLY,  send  a  copy  of  the output file to

              RLVAD::IUES immediately.  If it occurs for many  images,

              resubmit  the  job (operators may have mounted the wrong

              tapes).



           o  Volume "tapename" not known to TDMS



              Send  output  file  to  RLVAD::IUES   immediately.    If

              "tapename"  is an archive tape name (ie beginning WIL or

              NAS), rerun IUEDEARCH omitting the images on that  tape.

              NB:   If  this  error  occurs,  the  output  is  usually

              returned immediately.



          If an ABEND or an ERROR not stated above is  shown  on  your

          output, resubmit the job and if the same error occurs again,

          send your output file to RLVAD::IUES, and await a reply.



          It should be safe to assume that if the header of a  certain

          file  has  been  printed,  and the next file number has been

          written in WDCnnn.OUT, or the end  of  copying  message  has

          been written, then that file will be on the tape.







          9.4  Examples



          First a warning:  the IBM program is in the process of being

          updated  and some of the comments which appear in the output

          no longer apply.  Please follow the instructions given here.

          The  start  of  the  WDCnnn.OUT file looks like this but any

          errors will be highlighted between lines of  asterisks.   In

          this  case  the  output  was returned immediately owing to a

          TDMS error.  Resubmit the job perhaps an hour later.

          re-dearchive the images which are not on the offending tape.



          If the job has run then the start of the file  copying  will

          look  like  this  with  five lines from the image header for

          each file copied.

          This shows an index error  where  the  file  read  does  not

          correspond  to  that  expected.  The same error can occur in

          the wrong tape is mounted.  Re-dearchive the image again and

          if  the  same  promblem  occurs  send the WDCnnn.OUT file to

          RLVAD::IUES.

          The following two examples show  where  a  tape  read  error

          occured.   In the first case while reading the header and in

          the second while reading the data.  The first error can also

          be caused by not having a tape on the drive.
