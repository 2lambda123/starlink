1  INTRODUCTION

This note should be read by any astronomer who uses catalogue data, or
any person in the UK who intends to use CDS Astronomical catalogues.

The Centre De Donnees Stellaires - (Stellar Data  Centre,  Strasbourg,
France)  -  is the major distributor of Astronomical Catalogue Data in
Europe.  Its products are astronomical catalogues on magnetic tape and
microfiche.   It  is  also  responsible  for  the  SIMBAD Astronomical
Catalogue Database System.  It publishes a regular bulletin describing
its products.

Three years ago, ROE made  an  order  for  the  entire  magnetic  tape
database  of  Astronomical  Catalogues  from  CDS.   Owing  to lack of
resources to organise a database at ROE, the library of 32  1600bpi  9
track ASCII tapes received from CDS was moved to the RAL Starlink site
in June 1984.  At RAL, the tapes were  analysed  and  security  copies
made.  An indexing system was set up to allow users to locate the tape
containing the catalogue they wanted.  Starlink has placed a  standing
order  for  catalogues  from  CDS.   A  support  person  at  RAL  will
assimilate each CDS tape into the offline database  according  to  the
guidelines  in SSN/34.  He will update the index to the CDS catalogues
and distribute the index as part of a SCAR software release.  It  will
only  be  distributed  on  demand.  Printed summaries of the index are
appended to this note.  Starlink  users  who  produce  catalogues  are
encouraged to send them to CDS for distribution throughout Europe.

The Starlink Catalogue Access and Reporting System, SCAR (see SUN/70),
is  a  general  catalogue handling system and can be used for directly
processing a CDS tape.

2  ASTRONOMICAL CATALOGUES ON TAPE

2.1  CDS Tapes

The tapes are 9-track, 1600 bpi unlabelled tapes each containing 1  to
100  or  so  files written in ASCII code.  In July 1985 there were 855
files of which 424 were documented.  Most of the catalogue data are in
the  form  of  tables,  so  they can be directly processed by the SCAR
system.  "Documentation" is used here to mean  that  there  is  enough
information  for  the  columns  of  the  table  to be understood.  The
contents of these tapes have been indexed.

Many catalogues are contained in more than  one  file.   Most  of  the
files  have  a  unique  identifier placed at the start of each record.
This  file  identifier  is  the  "dataset  id".   It  consists  of   7
characters:

      o  Characters  1  to  4  are  the  number  of   the   catalogue.
         Catalogues are numbered:

          o  1000 - 1999 = Astrometric Data

          o  2000 - 2999 = Photometric Data

          o  3000 - 3999 = Spectroscopic Data

          o  4000 - 4999 = Cross-Identifications

          o  5000 - 5999 = Combined Data

          o  6000 - 6999 = Miscellaneous Data

          o  7000 - 7999 = Extended and Non Stellar Objects


      o  Character 5 is the  subcatalogue  letter.   The  files  in  a
         catalogue would be denoted A, B, C etc.

      o  Character 6 and 7 contain the year of release by CDS.

Where a catalogue is contained in more than one file, it is often  the
case  that  the  first  file  describes the other files, which usually
would contain the data catalogue (a table  of  numbers)  and  possibly
references.   All the catalogues from CDS are summarised in an "index"
file which contains the names of the catalogues, their location in the
tape  library,  the  authors  and references, documentation flag, etc.
The main index CDST is ordered by tape number and then file number  on
the  tape.   The entries for documented files have been extracted from
the main index and sorted on various useful fields:

        CDSA  : Author and dataset number
        CDSW  : Wavelength and dataset number

                                - 2 -
SUN/79.3                                                        Page 3


        CDSC  : CDS type (class) and dataset number
        CDSO  : Object type and dataset number
        CDSN  : Title of catalogue and dataset number

These indexes are FACTs catalogues and can be processed using the  CAR
programs  (see  SUN/70).   Listings of the indexes in tabular form are
available in the CDS_DOC directory at your site.  For example to print
the NAME index:

        $ PRINT CDS_DOC:CDSN.CAR

The Author index is appended to this note.  The files run to about  10
printer pages.



2.2  Getting Tapes

On request, the Starlink Support team at RAL will send  a  copy  of  a
tape  containing  a  CDS  catalogue  to  any  Starlink user.  Mail to:
RLVAD::STAR "CDS catalogue request from XNODE::USER".   Give  the  CDS
tape name that you want (eg:  SD405), your name and postal address.  A
jiffy bag will be sent containing a copy of the tape.  You must obtain
your  own  documentation  (see GETTING DOCUMENTATION).  Users who want
more than one tape in a monthly period must come to RAL to make  their
own  copies.  This distribution system is on a best efforts basis.  If
RAL gets deluged with requests (more than 1 per  week)  then  we  will
have to review the distribution system.



2.3  Getting Documentation

The CDS catalogue documentation has been photocopied and  a  3  volume
set  has  been  sent  to  the  site  manager at Birmingham, Cambridge,
Durham, Leicester, Birmingham, RGO, ROE and UCL.  It is ordered by the
catalogue  number  of  the  dataset  id.   Users  should refer to this
documentation to get information on the fields in a  catalogue.   Note
that  the  CDST  contains  a field to indicate whether a file has been
documented.  RAL Starlink Support will retain the master copy  of  the
documentation.



2.4  FACTS Description Files

When a CDS tape is assimilated into the offline  database,  a  partial
FACTS  description file is produced which contains all the information
SCAR requires to get the catalogue off  the  tape.   Each  description
file  is named DSCF, followed by the first 5 characters of the dataset
id "rolled" to put the last character  at  the  front  to  generate  a
unique  filename.   For  example, the GCIO has dataset number 6020A83.

                                - 3 -
SUN/79.3                                                        Page 4


Drop the last two characters and "roll" the remainder to  give  A6020.
The description file is then DSCFA6020.

The description files are kept in a text library in the CDS directory:
CDS_DSCF:CDSDSCF.TLB.   The  entire  record of the description file is
described in a single field called "TEXT".  To analyse the contents of
each  record,  users must employ the catalogue documentation to define
each field.  Each description file contains the first  1400  bytes  of
the  file  to  assist  in describing the data.  If you generate a full
FACTS description file (see SUN/70), please mail it  to  RAL  Starlink
Support at RAL who will put it in the SCAR description file directory.



2.5  Tape To Disk

You can use any TAPE utility to get a CDS catalogue off a tape, or you
can  use  SCAR.  If you use SCAR, you must issue the START_CAR command
before any other SCAR commands.  SCAR gives  you  two  ways  of  doing
this:   CAR_CONVERT  and CAR_EXTAPE.  Use CONVERT if you only want one
file.



2.5.1  CONVERT A CDS Catalogue From Tape To Disk - This example  shows
how to get 6020A83 onto disk:

        $ CAR_MOUNT  ! Allocate and mount on TAPE0
        $ LIB/LOG/EXTRACT=(DSCFA6020)/OUTPUT=DSCFTAPE0.DAT/TEXT -
                CDS_DSCF:DSCFTAPE.TLB
        $ ED/READ DSCFTAPE0.DAT

    <In the edit, change the value of MEDIUM from TAPE to DISK
     and then EXIT DSCFA6020.DAT>

        $ CAR_CONVERT/FROM=TAPE0/TO=A6020
        $ CAR_DISMOUNT TAPE0

This is the easiest method if you only want one file.   You  can  then
decompose   the   TEXT   field   into  the  fields  specified  by  the
documentation.  For greater detail see example in section 4.



2.5.2  EXTAPE - Extract A CDS Catalogue From Tape - This example shows
how to get 6020A83 onto disk:

        $ CAR_MOUNT  ! Allocate and mount on TAPE0
        $ LIB/LOG/EXTRACT=(DSCFA6020)/OUTPUT=DSCFTAPE0.DAT/TEXT -
            CDS_DSCF:CDSDSCF.TLB

    <Get the filenumbers and logical record lengths by

                                - 4 -
SUN/79.3                                                        Page 5


     looking in DSCFA6020>

        $ CAR_EXTAPE

CAR_EXTAPE prompts for TAPE deck name (TAPE0) and asks the  number  of
tapemarks to skip (= Filenumber - 1).  You can examine the file to see
whether it is what you wanted.  You can  measure  the  logical  record
length.   You  can  give  any integer value for MARKS, so you can skip
back and forth along the tape.  This is the most efficient  method  if
you want more than one file.  The tape does not have to be rewound for
each file.  For more detail, see section 4.



2.6  Miscellaneous IPMAF Tapes

The IRAS Post Mission Analysis Facility inherited 32  catalogues  from
the  IRAS Preliminary Analysis Facility.  The 32 catalogues are stored
on six 9-track 1600 bpi ASCII tapes at the  RAL  Starlink  site.   The
catalogues  are listed in Appendix C.  These catalogues were processed
from original tapes into G-EXEC files for the PAF ICL  2960  and  then
converted  to  ASCII format for use on Starlink at the end of the IRAS
mission.  Many of the catalogues are in the  CDS  library.   As  blank
fields  were converted to zeroes by G-EXEC, the CDS version is usually
to be preferred as the CAR system specially processes null data.

Each catalogue on the tape is preceded by a pseudo ADC version 1 (1980
vintage)  description  file.   There  is  enough  data in this file to
identify the fields in the succeeding catalogues.   The  documentation
on each catalogue is kept by the STARLINK support group.  Files can be
extracted from the tapes using the EXTAPE program.   Copies  of  these
tapes are available, as are the CDS tapes.

The original catalogue tapes are kept at RAL  in  the  R3  tape  store
(IRAS  area).   Many  of  them  are  in EBCDIC code.  Some have parity
errors which were only circumvented by skipping the offending  blocks.
There  is  no  intention of distributing these original tapes.  Anyone
can make their own copy if they so desire.

3  SIMBAD

3.1  What Is SIMBAD?

SIMBAD  stands  for  "Set   of   Identifications,   Measurements   and
Bibliography  for  Astronomical  Data".   It  is a database system for
accessing the Astronomical Catalogue Data accumulated by CDS.  In  the
UK,  SIMBAD  can  be  accessed by making a PSS call to the main SIMBAD
computer in France.  What  makes  it  unique  is  the  combination  of
astronomical  catalogue  data and bibliographic data.  This means that
if you are interested in Object X, you can get all  the  bibliographic
and  catalogue  entries  on  Object  X  from  the database.  SIMBAD is
already employed by many astronomical institutions in Europe.  It is a
cheap  facility;  the  annual  standing  charge for the Vilspa, Madrid
station is about four hundred pounds  per  year.   Computing  time  is
charged  at  15  French  Francs  per  minute (minimum charge 50 French
Francs).  SCAR and SIMBAD complement  one  another  very  well.   SCAR
enables  you to handle catalogues globally and isolate your objects of
interest.  SIMBAD then enables you to follow up those objects  in  the
literature.

STARLINK has  come  to  the  following  agreement  with  CDS  for  the
extension of SIMBAD to more UK users:

      o  The maximum number of user accounts will be  1  per  STARLINK
         node.  This is to reduce administration at the CDS.

      o  A SIMBAD account, and any associated PSS charges, are  to  be
         paid  for  by  the  owner  of  the  account, not by STARLINK.
         Potential users of SIMBAD should include its expected cost in
         their funding applications.




3.2  Getting A Username From CDS

If you are interested in using SIMBAD then you should write to:

        Dr C JASCHEK,
        CENTRE DE DONNEES STELLAIRES,
        11, RUE DE L'UNIVERSITE,
        67000,
        STRASBOURG,
        FRANCE

You will be supplied with  a  username  and  manual.   Once  you  have
obtained  the  username  you should arrange with your site manager for
authorisation to call "SDC".  The SDC  number  can  be  obtained  from
Starlink Support at RAL.

3.3  Using SIMBAD Over The PAD

You must first acquire network authorisation from your site manager to
call  CDS via the PSS.  The PSS number for CDS is 20809104057310*DPSI.
Your site manager should give you authorisation for  calling  CDS  via
the call address mnemonic "SDC".

The following is the procedure for accessing the SIMBAD data  base  at
SDC.   The  dots  refer to informational responses which have not been
recorded.

        $ PAD
        PAD> SET P13 0
              ......
        PAD> JOU filename
        PAD> CALL SDC
           ......
           ......
           ......
        ENTER USERID/PASSWORD CLEARANCE LEVEL
        > userid/password
          ......
          ......
          ......
        > @CDS*SIMBAD.P,E
           ......
           ......
           ......
        > enter your name   Simbad username

  (You are now in SIMBAD and should use the SIMBAD reference
   manual to proceed correctly. To terminate the session the
   following is required)

        > END         terminates the SIMBAD session
        > @FIN        terminates the UNIVAC session
        > @@TERM      terminates the connection

        PAD> CLEAR     (if the above terminations are OK,
                         this is superfluous)
        PAD> EXIT
        $

Dr P.  Hill of St Andrews recommends that  you  use  the  PAD  JOURNAL
facility  which  enables a record to be kept of all I/O when connected
to the remote host.  The journal file can be printed at the end of the
session.    One   warning:    it  contains  lots  of  strange  control
characters; Dr Hill (REVAD::PWH) has an editing routine  to  clean  it
up.

4  EXAMPLE CATALOGUE CREATION

4.1  Finding Data

Appendix A indicates that the Fourth Uhuru Catalogue was on tape  415A
file 36 and dataset 7018A78.



4.2  Creating Basic Description File

Log in and initiate SCAR

        $ LIB/LOG/EXTRACT=(DSCFA7018)/OUTPUT=DSCFA7018.DAT/TEXT
        
        LIB:- CDS_DSCF:CDSDSCF.TLB

Print out DSCFA7018.  This allows you to obtain information on  record
length and file size.



4.3  Obtaining Data File From Tape


        $ CAR_MOUNT and mount tape 415A
        $ CAR_EXTAPE
        $ CAR_DISMOUNT when job complete.

Skip 35 files and examine file 36.  This was confirmed as Fourth Uhuru
Catalogue.   It  also  confirmed record length, in this case 88 bytes.
The data was then dumped to file A7018.DAT.  Since the file only  held
339  records  printed  out  complete  file,  (if  file is much larger,
suggest printing out  sub-set).   From  the  printout  identified  the
fields and record structure.  In this case RA, DEC, FLUX,and COMMENTS.



4.4  Expansion Of Description File

Edited the following into the basic description file.

        P KEYFIELD ----- etc
        P EPOCH ------ etc
        F NAME -----  etc
        F RA  -----   etc
        F DEC ----    etc
        F FLUX ----- etc
        F COMMENTS ----- etc

Also change TAPE to DISC in P MEDIUM, (this is essential in  order  to
open data file).

                                - 8 -
SUN/79.3                                                        Page 9


4.5  First Test

Used CAR_REPORT on A7018F.  This identified two problems.

     1.  NAME - was one byte too short.

     2.  FLUX - a number of entries did not have a decimal  point  and
         wrong values were output.

Edited the description file to correct the first  error.   Edited  the
data  file to correct the second error; care had to be taken with this
edit to ensure that each record did not contain more than 88 bytes (ie
the length of the record in this case).



4.6  Creation Of Unformatted Description File

Used CARBINARY with DSCFA7018 as input and DSCFTES1 as  output.   This
created DSCFTES1.DAT



4.7  Creation Of Unformatted Data File

Used CARCONVERT with A7018 as input and TES1 as output.  This  created
TES1.DAT and saves space in large files.



4.8  Testing Unformatted Files

Carried  out  CARREPORT  on  TES1.   This  showed  an  error  in   the
unformatted description file.

        1. F RA------  DEGREES.
        2. F DEC______ DEGREES could not be translated.
        3. F RA  ------ 1.570796 gave 6 Hrs RA instead of 0 Hrs RA.

Edited DSCFTES1.DAT to change

        1.   RA DEGREES to HHMMSS.S!
        2.   DEC DEGREES to SDDMMSS!
        3.   RA  1.570796 to 0.000000




4.9  Next Test

CARCONVERT repeated with A7018 as input and TES1 as output.

4.10  Sorting Data In Descending Declination

Having tested yet again  with  CAR_REP,  we  now  wanted  to  sort  in
descending   declination  to  allow  us  to  use  CARJOIN  with  other
catalogues.  Used CAR_SORT with TES1 as  input  and  TES2  as  output.
Note   that  this  program  produces  the  required  description  file
DSCFTES2.DAT.



4.11  Final Testing


        $ CAR_REP       ok!
        $ CAR_SEARCH    ok!
        $ CAR_JOIN      ok!

Could now be considered for implementation as SCAR Catalogue.
