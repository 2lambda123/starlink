             -------------------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

Program APLATE is an SGS version of a program developed at the AAT  to
compute  required hole positions for a fibre optics aperture plate for
the AAT.  It will produce:

     1.  A Report file of the input positions, their hole  coordinates
         and warning and error messages.

     2.  A Plot file to be copied to the GKS rasterizer  (by  default)
         or  other  device  as specified, which will then draw a scale
         diagram of the plate showing orientation, hole positions  and
         TV mirror vignetting.

A 40 arcminute diameter field round plates  and  12  arcminute  square
field rectangular plates are catered for.



2  RUNNING THE PROGRAM

To run the program type:

        $ APLATE <parameterlist>

for example:

        $ APLATE NGC5128,DEVICE=ARGS

will produce a plot from the input file NGC5128.DAT on the ARGS and  a
report file NGC5128.LOG for subsequent printing.

<parameterlist> is  made  up  of  the  following  optional  parameters
separated by spaces, commas or forward slashes:


                                - 1 -
SUN/89.2                                                        Page 2


   [INPUT=]inputfile[.DAT]          NOTE: You may omit the INPUT= from
   PLOT=plotfile[.PLT]                    the input file specification
   LOG=logfile[.LOG]                      provided only that it comes 
   DEVICE=plottertype                     first in the parameter list.
   PLATE=platetype
   DATE=observation_date
   EPOCH=epoch_of_position_data
   CAMERA=camera_identification

The above parameters default in various ways.  INPUT defaults  to  the
keyboard.  LOG defaults to the screen for keyboard input, otherwise it
takes its name from the input file name unless given as  a  parameter.
DEVICE  may  be any logical name which translates to a GKS workstation
identifier and defaults to a GKSRASTER metafile  for  the  Printronix.
If  DEVICE is specified, the plot file will be forced to FOR000.DAT as
it must be opened by GKS.  Keywords and their values may be in  either
case.   Keywords  may be abbreviated, but be careful about ambiguities
(eg IN for INPUT is OK but PL can mean PLOT  or  PLATE).   File  types
default to that shown in brackets if not specified.

<platetype> can be either 12ARCMIN or 40ARCMIN, but need not be  given
in  the  parameter list; it defaults to 12ARCMIN and can be overridden
by a command in the input file.  <observation_date>  defaults  to  0.1
year    hence.     <epoch_of_position_data>    defaults   to   1950.0.
<camera_identification> may be either  82  (the  default)  or  25  and
controls  the  limits  of  the allowed rotator angles.  At the time of
writing, the limits for the 25cm camera are  0  and  275  degrees  and
those for the 82cm camera are 88 and 92 degrees.

<inputfile> consists of commands commencing in column  1  as  detailed
below:

Command              Specifies                        Default 

L  label             Plot label                       no default
12ARCMIN             Rectangular plate
40ARCMIN             Round plate                      12ARCMIN
D  date              Observation date                 1.2 month hence
E  epoch             Epoch                            1950.0
O  orientation       Rotator position                 90deg
S  scale             Plate scale                      6.6839 arcsec/mm
T  [Tobs][,Tdrill]   Temperatures                     f(month) & 25 C
C  position          Plate centre position            no default
F  position          Fiducial object position         no default
P  position          Programme object position        no default
X  arcsec            Extra fiducial positions         no default
                        (+ve North, -ve South)

   position          = right_ascension declination [epoch]
   right_ascension   = hours minutes seconds

SUN/89.2                                                        Page 3


   declination       = [sign]degrees minutes seconds
   epoch             = years (A.D., floating point)
   date              = years (A.D., floating point)
   orientation       = degrees (floating point)
   scale             = arcseconds/mm (floating point)
   label             = character string
   Tobs              = degrees Celsius (floating point)
   Tdrill            = degrees Celsius (floating point)
   arcsec            = arc seconds north of centre (floating point)

Positions can have epochs appended to them which override the  current
default  for  that  position  only.   Right  ascension and declination
components are integer except for seconds which are floating point.

Commands may in be upper or lower case.

It is recommended that the plate scale and  default  temperatures  are
not overridden.

A more detailed description of these commands may  be  found  in  "AAO
Fibre  System  Manual"  by  Peter  Gray  and Ray Sharples (UM18) which
should be read by intending fibre observers.  This is  available  from
the AAO.

NB:  Using the 40 arcminute field requires that the  RGO  Spectrograph
be  mounted  on  an extender box and then fouls equipment racks in the
Cassegrain cage at any  orientation  other  than  90  degrees.   Until
further notice, only the default orientation should be used.



3  PLOTTING THE PLATE DIAGRAM

To plot on the Printronix:

        $ PRINT/QUEUE=GKS_RASTER/PARAM=PRINTRONIX <filename>

Don't forget to include the file type in the <filename>.

To plot on the  Zeta  (if  available)  you  could  use  the  following
sequence:

        $ ALLO TXA5:
        $ COPY FOR000.DAT TXA5:
        $ DEALL TXA5:
        $ EXIT

This assumes that the Zeta plotter is TXA5:  and that DEVICE=ZETA  has
been specified.  This may be different away from the AAO.

4  INSTALLATION NOTES

The software supplied consists of the  executable  program  APLATE.EXE
and  everything  required  to produce it.  Source code is provided for
the main program APLATE and the subroutine packages APSUB and FMTUTIL.
Two  additional  object  libraries  OC6 and REENT are provided without
source code.  APLATE.EXE can be recreated  by  executing  the  command
procedure   APLINK.COM.    This   assumes   that   the   SGS6  library
(LIBDIR:SGS.OLB) and the GKS6 software item (GKSDIR:) are available.

Define the logical name APLATEDIR:  to point to the directory  holding
the software; e.g.

        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM APLATEDIR STARDISK:[STARLINK.UTILITY.APLATE]

Define the symbol APLATE as a foreign command; e.g.

        $ APLATE :== $APLATEDIR:APLATE


All source code written by me in this package is  in  FORTRAN  77  but
does  not  fully  comply with all Starlink standards.  I apologise for
this and can offer various excuses.  In particular, points 1,  7,  16,
22  and 39 of SGP/16 are violated to such an extent that rectification
is impractical,  although  some  considerable  effort  has  gone  into
reducing  this.   The Starlink environment is not required for running
this program.

If you have any problems with this software please send details to the
Starlink Software Librarian (RLVAD::STAR).  These will be forwarded to
John Straede at the Anglo-Australian Observatory.
