                       LZCMP - File compression
                       ------------------------


LZCMP implements the Lempel-Ziv  file  compression  algorithm.   Files
compressed  by  LZCMP are decompressed using LZDCMP.  The source files
contain documentation commented out at the beginning of the  code  for
those curious about the programs' operation.

To use LZCMP and LZDCM, define them as DCL foreign  symbols.   At  RAL
they are defined as:

         $ LZCMP:== $ UTILITYDIR:LZCMP

         $ LZDCM:== $ UTILITYDIR:LZDCM

To compress a file use the command:

         $ LZCMP -v inputfile.typ compressedfile.typ

or to decompress use the command:

         $ LZDCM compressedfile.typ decompressedfile.typ


The -v switch for LZCMP is the "verbose" switch so that when LZCMP  is
completed  it  will  report what it did.  The default operation on VMS
preserves file attributes in the compressed file.
