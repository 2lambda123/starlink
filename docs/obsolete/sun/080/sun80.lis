  IRAS - Extended Emission and Pointed observation data: User Guide
  -----------------------------------------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

Since the release of  version  .1  of  this  note,  the  IRAS  Pointed
Observations(AO's)   and   sky   plate   data   from   all   3   hours
confirmations(HCON's) have  become  available,  and  various  programs
produced  by the IRAS Post Mission Analysis Facility (IPMAF) have been
updated.  These changes to the IRAS image archive and  IPMAF  software
are  reflected  in  this  document.   In  particular,  systems for the
retrieval of all AO's are now described.  Further, some  modifications
to  I_PICV  are  given  is  5.2.   The  program  now handles AO's, the
galactic plane maps and the sky plates, and allows the display of  the
positions of IRAS sources and AO's on the images.

The published IRAS data are

      o  The catalogues of point and small sources.

      o  The sets of surface brightness images of the whole  sky  (the
         Extended Emission data set).

      o  The  Chopped  Photometric  Channel  (CPC)  and  survey  array
         pointed observations.

The IPMAF has been set up at the RAL STARLINK node to make these  data
readily available to the UK astronomical community via STARLINK.  Jock
Gourlay (X6478, RLVAD::JAG), Phil  Richards  (X6723,  RLVAD::PJR)  and
Brian  Stewart  (X5548, RLVAD:BCS) are responsible for making the IRAS
image data available and should be contacted if you wish to use  these
data.



2  THE EXTENDED EMISSION DATA SET

This data set has four components:

                                - 1 -
SUN/80.2                                                        Page 2


      o  A set of 212 high resolution 'SKY Plates' covering the  whole
         sky.

      o  A set of 24 'Galactic Plane Maps'  obtained  by  rebinning  a
         subset of the SKY Plates.

      o  A set of 2 'Low Resolution All Sky Maps'  each  covering  the
         whole sky.  One map is centred on the galactic centre and the
         other the anti-centre.

      o  A Zodiacal Observation History File  giving  a  time  ordered
         history  of  the Zodiacal emission as seen by IRAS during the
         survey.

For each of the Plates and Maps there are  4  sets  of  data  (images)
corresponding  to  the  the  4  IRAS  wavebands  of 12, 25, 60 and 100
microns.  Further, the  Sky  Plate  images  each  have  an  associated
statistical  weight  image.   These  have  not  been generated for the
Galactic Maps but could, in principle, be generated from those for the
Sky Plates.

The Extended  Emission  images  are  available  both  as  photographic
negatives  and  as  digital  data on tape.  The negatives exist in two
formats.  The first has all four bands reproduced side by  side  in  a
rectangular format approximately 5 inches square which is intended for
enlargement to prints 16 inches by 20 inches.  In order to display the
whole dynamic range of the data the grey scale employed corresponds to
the fifth root of the surface brightness.   The  second  format  is  a
colour  composite  representing the 100micron map in red, the 60micron
map in green and the 12micron map  in  blue.   Photographic  negatives
have  been  distributed  to about 30 astronomical institutes in the UK
(also see section 6.0).  The digital data is  available  via  RAL  and
section 4.0 describes the means of access.

The IRAS survey covered most parts of the sky three times  during  the
10  months  of  data  collection.  Each of these coverages (HCON's) is
distinct and is processed separately, this results in  three  sets  of
the  image  like  products.  The first two HCON's were of about 95% of
the sky, the third of about 71%.  All the Extended  Emission  products
will  be  available  at RAL.  As of the date of this note, we have the
complete sets of SKY Plates from HCON1, HCON2 and HCON3, the  Galactic
Plane  maps  from  HCON1,  and  the Low Resolution Maps from all three
HCONS.  The remaining Galactic Plane data we expect in  the  next  few
months.

Finally, the IRAS Explanatory Supplement describes in detail  how  the
extended source products were derived from the IRAS raw data.

2.1  SKY Plates

These are about 16.7 degrees square and have plate  centres  separated
by  15  degrees  in  Right  Ascension  and  Declination.   The  plates
nominally have 499 by 499, 2 arcmin.*2 arcmin.,  pixels.   The  quoted
effective  resolution  is  6  arcmin.   The  data are presented in the
Gnomonic projection which is described in  the  FITS  header  of  each
image (see 4.3.2 PREPRO).

It should be remembered the images from a single survey  will  include
moving  objects  and  confirmation  should  be sought from 2 coverages
before  believing  objects/structures  etc  are  real  (see  also  the
Explanatory Supplement).

The digital data at RAL are stored on  6250  bpi  tapes.   Each  plate
requires  flux and statistical weight images to be stored for all 4 of
the IRAS bands.  The images are stored in separate  files,  each  tape
holding  the  64  images  required by 8 plates.  The plates from the 3
HCON's are stored on a total of 78 tapes.



2.2  Galactic Plane Maps

These cover the band of sky  within  +/-10  degrees  of  the  galactic
plane.  The maps are 16.7 by 20 degrees and have map centres separated
by 15 degrees in galactic longitude.  The maps nominally have  499  by
599,   2   arcmin.*2   arcmin.,  pixels.   The  rebinning  gives  some
degradation of the 6  arcmin  sky  plate  resolution.   The  maps  are
presented  in  the  Lambert  normal  equivalent cylindrical projection
which is described in  the  FITS  header  of  each  image  (see  4.3.2
PREPRO).

Again, 6250 bpi tapes are used for storage , each holding the 48 image
files corresponding to 12 maps.  This gives a total of 2 tapes for the
1st HCON data set.  The associated statistical  weight  maps  are  not
available  directly  but may, if needed, be derived from those for the
SKY plates.



2.3  Zodiacal Observation History File

For convenience in the analysis and treatment of  background  emission
from interplanetary dust (zodiacal emission) and other extremely large
scale emission features of the sky, the IRAS survey data was  averaged
to  half  degree  square beam size and along with pointing information
was preserved as a time ordered data set.  These data are available as
the  Zodiacal Observation History Tape at RAL.  However, the inclusion
of the point sources in the averaging process makes  these  data  very
difficult  to  interpret  and  no software is currently planned to use
them.

                                - 3 -

2.4  Low Resolution All Sky Maps

These are derived from the Zodiacal Observation  History  File.   They
cover  the  whole  sky  and  are  centred  on  the galactic centre and
anti-centre.  The maps  have  325  by  649  half  degree  pixels,  the
effective resolution being about a degree.  The maps are in the Aitoff
projection which is described in the FITS header of  each  image  (see
4.3.2 PREPRO).  Again the plates are available as digital data on tape
at RAL.



3  THE POINTED OBSERVATIONS DATA SET

During the ten month lifetime of IRAS, roughly 40%  of  the  observing
time  was devoted to pointed observations of selected objects.  Nearly
10,000  of  these  observations,  also  commonly   called   Additional
Observations  (AO's) were made of virtually every kind of astronomical
object using either the survey array or the  CPC.   The  survey  array
observations  are  described  and listed in the 'Users's Guide to IRAS
Pointed Observation Products' and those for the CPC in  the  'IRAS-DAX
Chopped Photometric Channel Explanatory Supplement'.  The survey array
observations are on a number of magnetic  tapes,  the  'User's  Guide'
lists  the tape and file for each observation.  The corresponding list
for the CPC observations is  in  file  CPCAOS.LIS  on  STARLINK.   The
'Guide'  and  'CPC  Explanatory  Supplement'  have  been circulated to
Astronomical Institutions in the UK, however, if you do not have ready
access  to  copies  please  contact  B.Stewart  at  RAL.  The lists of
observations are also available on STARLINK as SCAR  catalogues  IAOD,
CPCD and PIRO.



4  ACCESS TO IRAS IMAGE DATA AT RAL

Astronomers requiring IRAS image data should come,  at  least  in  the
first  instance,  to RAL and obtain these data using the facilities of
the RAL STARLINK node.   Arrangements  for  this  should  be  made  in
advance  with  either  Jock Gourlay (X6478, RLVAD::JAG), Phil Richards
(X6723, RLVAD::PJR) or Brian Stewart (RLVAD::BCS)  who  will  also  be
available to help visitors with any problems.

It is assumed the typical user of these data products will require the
small  number  of  sky plates, galactic maps, or AO's covering his/her
objects of interest.  Overall, this is seen  as  being  a  four  stage
process:

     1.  Logging in to the IRAS visitors directory.

     2.  Identifying the images containing the objects of interest and
         finding the tapes on which these are stored.

     3.  Copying the required images from tape to the STARLINK VAX and
         carrying  out  processing  needed to make the images Starlink
         compatible.

     4.  Copying the required images from the VAX  to  the  users  own
         tape which he/she will take back to his/her own node.

The steps in this process will produce listings which will be of value
when displaying and analysing these data (see section 5).

                                  facilities. Note, users wishing
                                  to keep data should copy it to
                                  tape as a subsequent user is
                                  at liberty to erase any data he
                                  finds left in these directories.

4.2  Image Identification

The required AO images are best identified  using  the  lists  in  the

                                - 5 -
SUN/80.2                                                        Page 6


guide  and  supplement  mentioned in 3.0 above.  For SCAR users, there
are catalogues (IAOD and PIRO) which contain both the lists  and  some
additional  information  pertaining  to  each  observation  (eg  noise
estimates).

Extended Emission plates/maps are most  simply  identified  using  the
charts  (fig  4.2)  and table (table 4.2) at the end of this document.
These show the sky plate/galactic map boundaries and give the tape and
file  numbers on which each plate/map is stored.  There is also a DSCL
program I_SKYPOSN available which once entered prompts  the  user  for
object  names  and  positions  and  returns a list of required plates.
Table 4.2 gives the corresponding tape and file numbers.



4.3  Image Extraction

This requires the following steps for  Extended  Emission  and  survey
array AO images

      o  Using FITSIN to copy the required images to disc on the VAX.

      o  Using PREPRO to convert the images to a  form  more  suitable
         for processing using the STARLINK image analysis software.

      o  Only for AO's, using I_COMBINE  to  convert  the  non  square
         pixels to square pixels.

CPC AO images require a  modified  extraction  procedure  because  the
images  on  tape  are  three  dimensional,  the  third dimension being
wavelength (the CPC operated at 50 and 100 microns).

      o  Using FITSIN to copy the required images to disc on the VAX.

      o  Using CPREPRO to split the 3-D image into two 2-D images.

The above extraction procedure is time consuming because  it  requires
images  to  be written to and from disc.  If the PREPROcessing is left
to be done at the visitors home institution it is very much quicker to
copy  the  required  files directly from one tape to another using the
STARLINK TPU utility (section 4.5).



4.3.1  FITSIN - Having identified the required  tape  and  files,  the
following procedure is run on the STARLINK VAX.

         are  displayed  with  North  up  and  East  to  the left.  In
         addition, it modifies all the appropriate image descriptors.

A listing of the image descriptors may be produced using I_PDESCR:

some  history of the image's production (table 4.3 gives the format of
a SKY Plate FITS header).

5  IMAGE ANALYSIS ON STARLINK

This section describes a small subset of the three hundred or so image
analysis  (ASPIC)  programs  available  which  have  been  found to be
particularly useful for the display and analysis of IRAS  image  data.
In  addition,  it  describes  IRAS  specific utilities which have been
developed.  Obviously, this section is not exhaustive and will  be  of
little  interest  to ASPIC experts, however it is hoped it will save a
lot of time for those who are relative newcomers to STARLINK/ASPIC.

ASPIC is more fully described in SUN/23, available at  RAL  from  Mike
Lawden  (X5114).   Further,  the  file  IRASDIR:ASPSUM.LIS  contains a
summary of the available ASPIC software.

The use of the current ASPIC  package  is  seen  only  as  an  interim
measure.   Ken  Hartley  has  revamped  it making use of the Graphical
Kernel System (GKS).  The package is now being developed and tested by
STARLINK  at  RAL.   The new package collects together the more useful
features of the old system  and  removes  its  many-fold  duplication.
Where  necessary, the IRAS specific software will be modified by IPMAF
for incorporation in this system when it becomes  available.   In  the
meantime  it would be useful to have reports of individuals experience
with the current system or any other software they may have access to;
these should be sent to B.Stewart at RAL.

The ASPIC programs described are considered under five headings:

      o  Image display

      o  Pixel coordinates and values

      o  Image subsets and contours

      o  Image cross-sections

      o  Image annotation

Finally the HELP facilities are outlined.




5.1  Image Display

The following describes how a number of the ASPIC basic  programs  are
used to display an image.

Initially ASPIC program ADISP is used to display an IRAS image on  the
ARGS  colour  graphics  terminal.   The  following  is  the  suggested
procedure for running this program:

                                  by a previous user.
DSCL>       ADISP

                                  0 in the ARGS colour table.
                                  Convenient choices are 0 for
                                  Extended Emission or CPC images
                                  and
                                      xx = DATAMIN/BSCALE
                                  for survey array AO's
PVHI/y/:=   return                Pixel value corresponding to
                                  255 in the ARGS colour table. A
                                  convenient choice is the default
                                  (maximum) data value. In the case
                                  of Extended Emission images I
                                  have found 1e8 a useful value
                                  for the images I have looked at.

ADISP converts pixel values in the range PVLO to PVHI to  ARGS  values
in  the  range  0  to  255 and stores them in the ARGS memory.  Values
below PVLO are set to 0,  values  above  PVHI  are  set  to  255.   In
addition  to  the  pixel  values,  the ARGS holds a colour table which
defines a colour for each of the 256 possible pixel values.  The  ARGS
will  always  contain  a  colour  table  so that ADISP will invariably
produce an image on the ARGS  screen.   However,  the  default  colour
table  is  unlikely  to  be  entirely  satisfactory  so  the following
programs provide some means to display and modify  it.   The  programs
considered are ABLOCK, LUTGREY, LUTREAD, and LUTLIN.

                                  BGYRW  Blue-Green-Yellow-Red-White.
DSCL>       LUTLIN  colour-table  This program uses the tracker
                    (e.g BGR)     ball and buttons to alter the
                                  colour table. If no colour
                                  table is specified a greyscale
                                  is used.

OUTPUT:=    filename              The modified colour table
            (or return)           may be stored in a file if
                                  required then used subsequently
                                  with LUTREAD.

LUTLIN is a particularly powerful tool for emphasising a small part of
the  dynamic  range  of  a  displayed image.  Using ADISP as described
above, divides the flux range of the image up into 256  equal  ranges.
Whatever the colour table, only a small number of these levels will be
distinguishable so that features of  interest  in  the  image  may  be
entirely  unresolvable.   As  an  example, we can consider the default
grey scale where a pixel value 0 corresponds to black and 255 to white
with a 'linear' interpolation in between.  The features of interest in
an image may well be in a limited part of the pixel  value  range  and
appear  as a nearly uniform shade of grey.  It would be of great value
to use the whole grey scale over this range and display  values  below
it  as  black  and  those  above as white.  LUTLIN makes this possible
under cursor  control.   The  cursor  is  most  conveniently  used  in
conjunction with the ABLOCK display.  The vertical cursor line is used
to define the limits over which the grey scale is  to  be  used.   The
tracker ball buttons have the following functions:

  Tracker Ball Button             Function

       1-left           Log of colour table
       2                Cursor position on ABLOCK scale
                        sets lower pixel limit
       3                Cursor position on ABLOCK scale
                        sets upper pixel limit

When any of the buttons are depressed, the colour  table  modification
is  nearly instantaneous.  Of course the same effect could be achieved
using ADISP and suitable values of PVLO and PVHI, but this is  a  much
slower  process.   However, redisplaying will show up much more detail
if using LUTLIN suggests only a very small part of the  total  dynamic
range is of interest.

5.2  Pixel Coordinates And Values

This section describes an IRAS specific program which has been written
to  allow  RA,  DEC  positions  to  be  identified on IRAS image data.
Version 1.4 of the program may be used with sky plates, galactic plane
maps,  CPC  AO's  and  any  COMBINE'd images.  The program also allows
pixel values to be printed and provides an  interface  with  the  IRAS
Point  Source,  Small  Structure and AO index Catalogues.  The program
writes some explanation of its DSCL prompts,  these  are  enclosed  in
quotes.   (NB this program will only work if an image has already been
displayed.)

5.3  Image Subsets And Contours

Chris Hurst at UCL has written two programs  I_COMBINE  and  I_CONTOUR
for  analysing  IRAS  Additional Observations data, and to process SKY
plate data.  The programs have many facilities which are described  in
detail in SUN/60.  The procedure below is only a simple example of how
they may be used to generate a subset of a SKY plate and then  display
it as a contour plot.

In order to identify the required subset, it is suggested the plate be
displayed  on  the  ARGS using SKYDISP or ADISP etc, then a coordinate
grid be superposed using PICV.  I_COMBINE and I_CONTOUR  may  then  be
used  as  follows  (these  programs write an explanation of their DSCL
prompts which, in the following, are enclosed in quotes):

5.4  Image Cross-Sections

ASPIC program MSLICE provides a mean  of  generating  a  cross-section
through  an  image.  LINPLOT may be used to produce a lineprinter hard
copy of this cross-section.  The commands are as follows:

 VAX        USER                     Comments
prompt      reply

DSCL>     MSLICE
INPUT:=   filename1                Name of image to be displayed.
                                  The tracker ball and buttons

                                - 21 -
SUN/80.2                                                       Page 22


                                  are used to define the line
                                  on the image through which the
                                  cross-section is to be taken.
                                  The cross-section is written to
                                  the ARGS screen.

The tracker ball buttons should be used in the following order:

  Tracker Ball Button             Function

       1-left           Used with the tracker ball to set one
                        end of the cross section.
       2                Used after button 1 to set the other
                        end of the cross section.
       3                Can be used instead of button 2.
       1                Used again when both ends have been set
                        and cross section is required. MSLICE
                        exits when this has been done.

OUTPUT:=  filename2               Name of file to which cross
                                  -section is to be written if a
                                  hard copy is needed.

NB:  The MSLICE output Y values have to be multiplied by  BSCALE  (see
Table 4.3) to convert them to JY/SR.

DSCL>           LINPLOT

5.5  Image Annotation

The ASPIC program ANNOTASP allows text to be written on an image.   An
example of its use is:

 VAX        USER                     Comments
prompt      reply

DSCL>     ANNOTASP                The program gives a list of
                                  its options including
                                  'WRITE (W)    Enter,position
                                           and display string'

                                  the required option. W
                                  chooses the WRITE option

STRING/ /:=text string            Text to be written to the
                                  ARGS screen.

 'Place cursor over bottom L.H. Corner of string position'

                                  Once cursor has been set
                                  depressing the illuminated
                                  tracker ball button causes
                                  the text to be written to
                                  the ARGS.

The options available can be printed by  typing  H  in  reply  to  the
COMMAND prompt.  Other options allow:

    - the size and colour of the text to be changed
    - arrows or scale intervals to be displayed
    - the removal of the last entered or all of the text
