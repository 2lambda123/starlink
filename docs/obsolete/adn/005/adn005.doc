           VAX implementation of ADAM: the message system            ______________________________________________ 








1. INTRODUCTION 


In the Perkin-Elmer implementation of ADAM, communication between the
controlling  process  (sometimes referred to as 'ADAM' !) and D-tasks
is  done  using  'messages'.   This  has  been  extended   to   allow
communication between A-tasks and the controlling process, also using
messages. 



2. DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE VAX 


A development of the ADAM concept of messages is to split the  system
still  further,  so that the Command Language Interpreter (CLI), user
interfaces, task loaders  etc.  are  also  separate  processes,  each
communicating  via  a  central 'message system' which makes sure that
messages and replies are sent to the correct destinations. 

Figure 1 (below) illustrates this concept.  Since it is expected that
there  will be a lot of communication between the CLI and A-tasks, it
was decided that the CLI running an A-task should reside in the  same
machine  as  that A-task;  this means that, for remote observing, the
remote workstation (VAX computer, not  just  a  terminal)  should  be
running  ADAM with its own message system.  Communication between the
remote and local (Hawaii) message systems is via  another  connection
to  the  message  system;  this  in  fact  turns  out  simply to be a
connection to a network. 

Another development is particularly required  for  remote  observing,
but  will  be  generally  useful.  This is the concept of attaching a



                                                                 ADN/5.1                           2                           ADN/5.1



'privilege' to all processes attached to  the  message  system.   The
message  system  will  be  told  which  processes are allowed to send
messages to which other processes as  they  became  active,  and  the
message  system  will  supervise this, only passing messages with the
correct privilege. 

Note that it must be well defined what happens when a message  cannot
be delivered, for whatever reason ! 



3. IMPLEMENTATION 


Implementation of the VAX message system for ADAM is scheduled to  be
completed by the end of March 1984. 


3.1 General notes     _____________ 

It is necessary to define firstly the message  format,  and  secondly
the  details  of  the message system subroutine interfaces.  The ADAM
system acts as the basis for both of these. 

In the VAX implementation the messages are sent to,  and  read  from,
'mailboxes'  maintained by VMS (RMS?).  The message system has either
a set of input mailboxes, each set up for a particular task (process)
when  that task is loaded;  or alternatively, a single input mailbox.
Each task has its own input mailbox, where it looks for its messages.
It  is  suggested that messages should be trapped (using ASTs) rather
than polled for. 

Note that if a process 'dies' its exit handler should place a message
to that effect in the message system mailbox for that process. 


3.2 Initial tests     _____________ 

A 'trial' message system is to  be  constructed  to  test  the  ideas
brought  forward  so  far,  from  consideration  of  the Perkin-Elmer
implementation and the system-provided operations  available  on  the
VAX.   This  should  be a 'proper' test in the sense that the message
system should stand alone, and react correctly to test messages.   To
this  end,  it  is  necessary  to  write  'stub'  routines which will
simulate a D-task and the CLI.  The CLI has been chosen as the  first
real  test  of the message system will come when single line commands
are needed to control the trial D-tasks in June.
