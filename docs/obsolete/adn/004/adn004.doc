      POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES FOR FINAL REMOTE OBSERVING SET-UP.       ________________________________________________________ 







1. BACKGROUND. 


In the short term, a simple remote observing facility is required, in
which  a  set  of terminals at Edinburgh allow communication with the
PDP-11 instrumentation computer on Mauna Kea. The only way to achieve
this without the commitment of software effort appears to be to use a
hardware PAD to connect the PDP to the network. File transfer is  not
provided by this option. 

In the longer term the PDP will be replaced by the  VAX  11/730.  The
remote  observing facility will then have to meet the requirements of
the 15-m telescope, and will have to allow file  transfer  with  data
compression.  This  note  concerns  the alternative ways of achieving
these long-term aims. 





















                                                                 ADN/4.1                           2                           ADN/4.1






2. HARDWARE PAD. 


This involves ROE providing file transfer protocols,  which  means  a
considerable amount of non-trivial software effort.

3. DECNET. 


Communication  between  the  machines  is  achieved  by  buying   DEC
software.  DECNET  allows  a  full range of facilities including file
transfer and the ability to  communicate  directly  between  programs
running  on  the  separate  machines.  Provision  is  also  made  for
electronic mail facilities and the ability to issue commands such  as
DIRECTORY.  A potential worry is that DECNET is very inefficient, and
so a remote observer might see an excessively slow response.

4. UWIST. 


The UWIST software allows file transfer, is free, and appears  to  be
much  faster than DECNET. It does not provide the other facilities of
DECNET and has the disadvantage of being a university product.

6. MEMO  (9.12.1983) 


      To:  Malcolm Longair 

    From:  Dennis Kelly 
           Peter Thanisch 

 Subject:  Report on remote observing to UK/NL Joint Steering Committee. 


6.1 Observers' needs.     _________________ 

Different observers will require different levels  of  sophistication
from  the  remote  observing  set-up.  For  example,  some  would  be
satisfied by a hard-copy  terminal  +  modem  +  domestic  telephone,
whereas others might require image processing and display facilities.
This has an effect on the requirement for remote observers to  travel
-  some  could  actually  observe from home (this has been done, as a
test, by Paul Bryant of RAL), whereas others might  need  a  Starlink
node,   and   yet   others  would  have  to  travel  to  one  of  the
observatories. 


6.2 UKIRT timescales.     _________________ 

p.5, section 3.1 mentions ROE having the UKIRT VAX on the  summit  of
Mauna Kea and communicating with networks by Spring 1984. This should
be changed to Spring 1985, or (optimistically) late 1984. 


6.3 Observers' opinions of remote observing.     ________________________________________ 

The report probably  exaggerates  the  enthusiasm  of  observers  for
remote observing. 


6.4 Instrumentation.     ________________ 

Note the impact of modern instruments with embedded  microprocessors.
This   allows   remote  diagnostics  to  be  built-in,  PROVIDED  the
requirement is forseen by the instrument developers. 


6.5 Weather.     ________ 

p.3, first paragraph,  mentions  taking  advantage  of  POOR  weather
conditions   being  a  potential  gain  from  remote  observing.  The
utilisation of rare, exceptionally  GOOD  weather  conditions  should
also be mentioned.
