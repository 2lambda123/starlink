  <description>Unix Security Cookbook</description>
  <abstract><p>
     This document has been written to help Site Managers secure their
     Unix hosts from being compromised by hackers. I have given brief
     introductions to the security tools along with downloading,
     configuring and running information. I have also included a
     section on my recommendations for installing these security tools
     starting from an absolute minimum security requirement.
