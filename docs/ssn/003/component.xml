  <description>The ECH Echelle Spectrograph Model Package</description>
  <abstract><p>
     The ECH package consists of a set of routines which model the
     behaviour of the UCL coude echelle spectrograph (UCLES) and of
     echelle spectrographs of similar design. Such spectrographs can
     differ in focal length (which is in fact irrelevant to the model
     package), cross-dispersing-prism apex angle, echelle ruling
     frequency, echelle blaze angle, and camera focal length.

     It is not capable of dealing with spectrographs which differ in
     any more major ways from UCLES, although it could be extended to
     do so should the need arise.
