  <description>Writing Catalogue and Image Servers for GAIA and CURSA</description>
  <abstract><p>
   GAIA and CURSA can interrogate remote catalogues via the Internet
   to return lists of objects which satisfy a given criterion.  GAIA
   can also extract images of a specified region of sky from remote
   databases.  Similar facilities are also available in other
   packages, such as the ESO SkyCat image display tool and the Gemini
   observing tool.  This functionality is achieved by having servers
   running on the remote systems, These accept queries sent by GAIA
   etc., interrogate their local copies of the catalogues to find the
   data which satisfy the query, and return them.  The servers can
   communicate with GAIA etc. because the query is sent, and the
   results returned, in a standard format.  This document describes
   how to write such servers.
