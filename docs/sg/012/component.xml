  <description>An Introduction to IRAF</description>
  <abstract><p>
      This document is an introduction to the IRAF software package
      and its use on Starlink systems.  IRAF is a powerful and
      comprehensive environment for reducing and analysing
      astronomical data.  It was developed at the National Optical
      Astronomy Observatories, Tucson and is in widespread use around
      the world.  IRAF has its own data file format, command language,
      on-line help system and programming language.  It is a modular
      system.  The basic core, which is always present, provides
      general facilities for image processing and data reduction.  For
      more specialised tasks additional packages are loaded to augment
      the core system. Software for processing most sorts of
      astronomical data is available for the IRAF environment.
