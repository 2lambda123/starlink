  <description>Programmer's Facilities &amp; Documentation Guide</description>
  <abstract><p>

      This document contains a directory of the facilities available
      to the ADAM programmer.  All documented aspects of ADAM
      programming are covered, ranging from introductory
      documentation, through applications programming to real-time and
      system programming.  Each facility is briefly described along
      with the type of work for which it might be used.  Most
      importantly, this guide shows at a glance where to obtain the
      relevant documentation.

      It is hoped to update this document relatively frequently, so
      that it serves as a guide to the latest ADAM developments.  Its
      format, which includes an overall index, is designed to allow
      its use as a table of contents for a personal file of
      programming documentation.
