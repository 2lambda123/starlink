Example Colour GIF Diagrams for SG/8.
====================================

This directory contains colour versions of the some of the diagrams
in SG/8, 'An Introduction to Visualisation Software for Astronomy'.
The diagrams are formatted as GIF image files.  Captions for the
individual files are as follows.


carpet_colour.gif
-----------------

A carpet plot. The plot shows a small region of a photographic plate
taken with the UK Schmidt Telescope at the Anglo-Australian Observatory,
Siding Springs, New South Wales and digitised with the SuperCOSMOS fast
microdensitometer at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh. The plot was
generated with IDL.


nscat_colour.gif
----------------

Two-dimensional vector data. The image shows wind vectors over the Pacific
Ocean south-east of Japan on the 20th September 1996. The white arrows
show the direction of the wind and the background colour indicates the
speed: with blue corresponding to low winds, red to moderate winds and
yellow to high winds. The data were obtained with the NASA Scatterometer
(NSCAT) on-board the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS).


slice_colour.gif
----------------

Perspective view of a slice in a three-dimensional data cube. The data
cube consists of a stack of radial velocity measurements of the HI 21cm
line over a small region of sky around the North Celestial Pole.  The slice
shows the intensity of the emission over the region at a single radial
velocity.  The observations were made with the Effelsberg 100m radio
telescope of the Radioastronomisches Institut der Universitat Bonn and
are described by Meyerdierks (1992, Astron. & Astrophys, v253, pp515-520).
The visualisation was generated with Data Explorer.


iso_colour.gif
--------------

Perspective view of an iso-surface in a three-dimensional data cube.  The
visualisation shows the same data cube as file slice_colour.gif.  It was
generated with Data Explorer.


vol_colour.gif
--------------

Perspective view of a volume rendering of a three-dimensional data cube.
The visualisation shows the same data cube as file slice_colour.gif.  It
was generated with Data Explorer.
