  <description>XRT: ROSAT XRT Data Reduction</description>
  <abstract><p>
    XRT is a package for reducing data acquired with the ROSAT XRT
    instruments.  The XRT (X-Ray Telescope) was the principal
    scientific payload of the ROSAT X-ray astronomy satellite.  The
    XRT had two instruments: the PSPC (Position Sensitive Proportional
    Counter) and the HRI (High Resolution Imager).  The XRT package
    operates on data produced by these instruments and can be used to
    transform them into calibrated images, spectra, time-series etc.

   XRT was created by taking the ROSAT XRT-specific functions in the
   ASTERIX general X-ray astronomy data reduction system and
   re-packaging them as stand-alone applications.
