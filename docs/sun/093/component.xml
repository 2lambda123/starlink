  <description>TeX --- A superior document preparation system</description>
  <abstract><p>
    TeX is an extremely flexible computer type-setting system designed
    by Donald Knuth. The full capabilities of TeX are described by
    its creator in `The TeX book' with the help of which the
    enthusiastic TeX user can produce elaborate documents of almost
    limitless complexity. However, unadventurous users can produce
    ordinary documents with a minimum of effort; simple Runoff
    files for example can be edited into TeX format very easily.

    This manual is an introduction to the use of TeX on Starlink
    machines.
