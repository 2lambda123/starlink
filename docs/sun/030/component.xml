  <description>Using the Starlink Database MicroVAX computer</description>
  <abstract><p>
     This paper tells you how to use the Starlink Database microVAX
     computer. This is installed at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
     and may be used by any registered Starlink user. As its title
     implies, its principal purpose is to provide access to
     astronomical databases, in particular: the star and galaxy
     catalogues and the IRAS catalogues used by the SCAR database
     management system, the IUE Uniform Low Dispersion Archive (ULDA),
     and a variety of spectral atlases. It is not a general purpose
     computer, and users will not have permanent file space or private
     usernames allocated on it.
