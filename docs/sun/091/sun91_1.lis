 IRAS/CRDD - Calibrated Raw Detector Data Analysis System: User Guide
 --------------------------------------------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

The IRAS instrument data has been  processed  by  the  Jet  Propulsion
Laboratory  in  California  to produce the IRAS Point and Small Source
catalogues  and  the  Extended  Emission  and  Additional  Observation
images.   The  analysis  was  conceived,  and  the processing software
written, sometime before the IRAS launch.  This was necessary in order
to  achieve  the  major project goal of a published catalogue one year
after the end of the mission.

Before IRAS  there  had  been  little  experience  of  the  long  term
performance  and  stability  of  IR  detectors  in  low  IR background
conditions.  Further, many earlier surveys at IR and other wavelengths
have   been   beset   with   problems   of  reliability.   With  these
considerations in mind, a somewhat conservative approach  was  adopted
for  the  designs  of  the  IRAS  focal  plane, survey and survey data
processing.  At the expense of some resolution, the  focal  plane  was
arranged  so  that a source image crossing it was seen by at least two
detectors in each of the wavelength bands.  The survey  scans  covered
any  particular  position  on  the  sky  up to 6 times on timescale of
hours, weeks and 6 months.  Finally, the processing  treated  each  of
the  observations separately to ask whether an object had been seen or
not.  Objects in the point source catalogue were those seen a  minimum
of  about  6  times  in  at  least  one band.  The performance of this
analysis approach was examined and tuned in great  detail  by  JPL  to
attain  high  levels  of  reliability  and  completeness for the Point
Source Catalogue (see the 'Explanatory Supplement' for details).

The IRAS detectors turned out to  be  much  better  behaved  than  was
expected  and  the numbers of 'false' detections rather fewer than the
software design approach  had  anticipated.   Since  the  end  of  the
mission  it has become clear that the multiple observations of a given
point on the sky can be 'co-added' to give both the  expected  root  N
increase in signal to noise with respect to the Point Source Catalogue
and much better spatial sampling than is  available  in  the  Extended

Emission images.

As one of the three partners in the IRAS project the UK has a complete
copy  of  the  calibrated raw detector data (CRDD pronounced 'crud' by
afficionados!).  These data reside at RAL and  the  current  and  past
members  of the IRAS Post Mission Analysis (IPMAF) team have written a
set of programs which make possible its  access  and  analysis.   This
document  is  the user guide to this software.  Astronomers wishing to
make use of the system should contact either B.Stewart (RLVAD::BCS) or
P.Richards (RLVAD::PJR) at RAL.



2  IRAS_FIND

Before embarking on a description of the CRDD system, this section  is
a reminder of the existence of the other IRAS products; these are:

     1.  The Point Source Catalogue.  (IRPS)

     2.  The Small Structure Catalogue.  (ISSC)

     3.  The Extended Emission Images.  (All 3 HCONs are available  at
         RAL)

     4.  The Survey Array and CPC Additional Observation (AO)  Images.
         These  cover  about  4%  of the sky and are catalogued in the
         IAOD.

For many purposes these may already contain the information you  want.
In  particular  the AOs cover small regions of sky about their nominal
targets which may include the object or region you are interested  in.
AO  data,  if  available, gives the greatest SNR and resolution of the
IRAS products, in fact the aim of the CRDD system has  been  to  match
this,  if  possible.   In order to simply check what data is available
the IRAS_FIND SCAR utility has been written.  This requests a position
and  search box and looks through the IRPS and ISSC for entries in the
box and the IAOD for entries which overlap the box.  The following  is
an example of using IRAS_FIND:

3  CRDD SYSTEM SUMMARY

The following gives an outline of the processing required  to  produce
usable  image  or  flux data from the CRDD.  The detailed way in which
these programs are used and specific  example  outputs  are  given  in
later sections.  The system has a MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED IMAGE SIZE which
our testing suggests is about 3deg.*3deg.



3.1  CRDD Tapes

The IRAS mission was carried out in 12 hour  pieces  called  Satellite
Operations Plans (SOP's).  A SOP consisted of a number of survey scans
and  Additional  Observations  (AOs).   The  raw  detector  data  were
processed  by  JPL, one SOP at a time, to produce a 6250 bpi CRDD tape
for each.  The entire mission  covered  603  SOPs,  the  corresponding

                                - 3 -
SUN/91.1                                                        Page 4


tapes being labelled with the SOP number of the data each contains.  A
single CRDD tape holds the calibrated raw detector data  in  1  second
segments  with  a  corresponding  pointing  direction of the telescope
(BORSYT) for each segment.



3.2  CRDD Image Production

There are 5 steps in producing an image from CRDD data, these are:

     1.  I_POSNTIM.  For the position on the sky of interest the scans
         which crossed it and the SOPs in which these occur have to be
         identified.  This function is  carried  out  by  the  program
         I_POSNTIM (POSitioN to TIMe).  For a given position(s) on the
         sky this produces a text file (TIMES) containing the SOP no.,
         scan  identification  and  time  of occurrence of each survey
         crossing (see Figure 1 for an example output).

     2.  I_CRABEX.   Having  identified  the  survey   crossings   the
         appropriate  pieces of CRDD data are required to be extracted
         from the CRDD tapes.  This function is  carried  out  by  the
         program  I_CRABEX (CRdd And Borsyt EXtraction).  When run the
         program uses the TIMES file produced by I_POSNTIM  to  prompt
         the  user  to mount the appropriate tapes on the RAL 6250 bpi
         tape unit.  It also prompts the user for a  filename  (CRDDF)
         for each crossing and band.

     3.  I_DESTRIPE.  Before an image can be produced there is a known
         DC  calibration  problem  which  has  to be 'corrected'.  The
         problem arises in the following way.  Over most  of  the  sky
         all  bands  show  a  substantial  DC IR signal arising from a
         combination of zodiacal,  galactic  and  other(?)  background
         emissions.  The errors in the DC calibration of the detectors
         result in varying estimates of this background level.  Images
         constructed using these differing estimates show 'stripes' at
         levels which  are  much  greater  than  the  detector  noise.
         Program I_DESTRIPE uses a 'flat fielding' technique to adjust
         the detector DC levels to substantially  remove  this  effect
         and   optionally   remove  a  constant  or  linearly  sloping
         background.  I_DESTRIPE is required to be run on each of  the
         CRDDF files.

     4.  I_CRDIMAGE.  Once a CRDDF file has been I_DESTRIPEd the  data
         samples  for  each detector are binned onto a 2-D image using
         program I_CRDIMAGE.  The resulting image file is  similar  to
         the  images  produced  from  the  processing  of  the pointed
         observations at JPL.

     5.  I_COMBINE.  Finally, the various overlapping image files  for
         a band are binned into a single image using program COMBINE.


                                - 4 -

3.3  Point Source Fluxes From CRDD.

If the object of interest is known to be a point source (ie less  than
1  arcmin  in  extent)  its  flux  should  be  estimated using program
I_COADD.  The I_POSNTIM and I_CRABEX steps outlined above  are  needed
to  retrieve  the  CRDD  but  instead  of  I_DESTRIPE,  I_CRDIMAGE and
I_COMBINE the single program I_COADD  is  run.   Point  source  fluxes
should NOT be estimated from images, see photometry section below.



3.4  IRAS Wavelength Bands

At this point  it  should  be  emphasised  that  I_CRABEX  produces  a
separate  file  for each crossing and each band.  This means the steps
I_DESTRIPE, I_CRDIMAGE, and I_COMBINE have to be repeated  to  produce
an image for each wavelength of interest.

The first entry in the TIMES.LIS file (Fig 1) gives the SOP number  of
this  tape.   Once  the tape has been mounted I_CRABEX may be run, the
following gives its prompts:

4.3  I_DESTRIPE

Each  CRDDF  file  produced  by  I_CRABEX  is  'destriped'  using  the
following procedure:

                                      image.

NB:  The process  of  destriping  "flattens"  the  baseline  for  each
detector to the same level.  Hence any gradual slope in the background
from detector to detector will be removed from  the  destriped  image.
The user should be aware of this when examining structure on the scale
of a few degrees.



4.4  I_CRDIMAGE

I_CRDIMAGE is used to convert each destriped CRRDF into an image file.

5  EASYIMAGE

Even for a 1 degree square region the steps DESTRIPE and CRDIMAGE  may
have  to  be  repeated  for  9  possible crossings.  The VMS procedure
EASYIMAGE considerably reduces the tedium of this task.  The  DESTRIPE
and  CRDIMAGE  parameters  are  prompted  for once and the files to be
processed are input via a text file  PREP.DAT.   NB:   all  files  are
processed with the same parameters.

PREP.DAT should contain a list of filenames eg:

        NGC6543_B1S1
        NGC6543_B1S2
        NGC6543_B1S3
        NGC6543_B1S4
        NGC6543_B1S5
        NGC6543_B1S6

EASYIMAGE is then run as follows:

    prompt        reply

NB:  This procedure is CPU intensive.  If more than 4 or 5  scans  are
to  be  processed,  the user is advised to run the job during off-peak
hours, ie lunch times or after 6.00 pm.



5.1  I_COMBINE

The image derived from a single scan will be about half a degree  wide
and  a  little  longer  than  that  required  to  cover  the region of
interest.  For a typical region of sky there  will  be  2  or  3  half
overlapping  sets  of  scans (HCONSs).  The program COMBINE is used to
assemble a complete image  from  these  sub  images.   To  obtain  the
correct  weights of the images in producing the overall image, all the
available sub images should be  COMBINE'd  in  a  single  run  of  the
program   (see   SUN/60,   section  4.1).   However,  it  is  STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED that images derived from individual HCONs be looked at  to
check that particular 'features' are indeed there on all crossings and
are not possible artifacts.  The 12 micron band is particularly  prone
to these problems and an example is shown in section 8.

NB:  As with EASYIMAGE, I_COMBINE is CPU intensive and for more than 4
or 5 images should be run during off-peak hours.



5.2  I_COADD

For point source photometry it is recommended that program I_COADD  be
used directly with the CRDDF files.  This program coadds corresponding
detector samples from the different crossings then subtracts  a  local
median  signal.  It then estimates the local noise in the coadded data
stream and searches about the nominal source position for point source
signals  above  a  given  threshold.  The results of this search and a
local noise estimate are written to a line printer file.

    DZ/0.0/:=   return                This may be set non-zero  as  a
                                      diagnostic. In conjunction with
                                      the  'raw  data  values  to  be
                                      printed'  option, it allows the
                                      raw  data  to  be  printed  for
                                      detectors   which  should  have
                                      been missed by the source. This
                                      is  of  value if the source  is
                                      believed to be extended.

        " Is data interpolation required(y/n)? "
    ANS:=       n                     A cubic spline interpolation of
                                      the   raw  data  values  is  an
                                      option.  This allows the sample
                                      positions     for     different
                                      detectors to be made to exactly
                                      correspond.  In   practise  the
                                      difference    this   makes   is
                                      marginal  and visibility of the
                                      original sample values is lost.

        " Is noise weighting required(y/n)?  "
    ANS:=       y                     Some of the IRAS detectors are
                                      intrinsically  more noisy than
                                      others. The detector weighting
                                      allows for this.

        " Are raw data values to be printed(y/n)? "
    ANS:=       y                     This a very useful diagnostic.
                                      The  individual  detector data
                                      streams are printed.

        " Is a noise histogram required(y/n)? "
    ANS:=       n                     This   diagnostic  allows  the
                                      noise estimation to be checked

6  RUN_COADD

This, somewhat crude, VMS procedure allows I_COADD to be  run  with  a
file CRDD_FILES.DAT containing the prompts to the program.  You should
only use this if you already have some experience of  running  I_COADD
in prompt mode.

CRDDFILES.DAT should contain the following:

    N
    NGC6543_B1S1
    Y
    NGC6543_B1S2
    Y
    NGC6543_B1S3
      " and so on for all files, termination is:-"
    N
    N

    RUN_COADD is then run as follows:-

     VAX          USER                      Comments
    prompt        reply

    $           @RUN_COADD

    prompts  will appear on the screen but be answered from the file
    until the $ prompt reappears.

described  in this note, may be invoked by typing IRASHELP in response
to the VMS prompt.



8  PHOTOMETRY

The CRDD data values on tape have  to  be  multiplied  by  a  constant
factor  to  reproduce  the published IRAS calibration, the appropriate
factor for each band is incorporated in  the  I_CRDIMAGE  and  I_COADD
programs.   The images from I_CRDIMAGE should give reliable total flux

estimates for sources bigger than 5 arcmins, (eg  by  using  the  flux
integration  facilities  in  the  IRAS  programs I_CONTOUR or I_PICV -
SUN's 60 and 80 respectively).  For sources smaller  than  5  arcmins,
fluxes estimated by integration within the required area are likely to
be in error by as much as 50%, due to the undersampling  in  the  IRAS
x-scan  direction  and  to  the effects of missing or noisy detectors.
For point sources fluxes should be obtained using I_COADD.



9  EXAMPLES

9.1  Image of Cometary Globule CG22

Figure 2 shows 60 micron maps of cometary globule CG22, the upper  one
was  derived  from a SKY Plate image and the lower from COMBINE'd CRDD
data.  The latter clearly shows superior spatial  resolution  and  the
effect of removing a local, sloping background.



9.2  Beware of Spurious Features

Users should always examine each HCON individually  before  COMBINEing
them  together.   This  procedure will help avoid wrongly interpreting
moving  sources,  glitches  and/or  detector  artifacts  as   infrared
structure.   The  set  of  12  micron  maps  in  figure 3 show how the
asymmetric point spread function apparent  on  brighter  sources,  the
change  in  scan  direction  in  HCON3  and the odd moving or variable
source can combine into what looks like "interesting structure" to the
uninitiated.



9.3  I_COADD of LMCN25

Figure 4 is a COADOP.LIS output for the 12 micron band.  The  first  4
lines  record  the run parameters used.  The groups of lines beginning
"OBJECT..." give the crossings.  The next part of the output gives the
sample   values   for   each   detector   crossing  the  source.   The
abbreviations are S=SOP, D=Detector, Z=crossing offset relative to the
detector  edge,  W=Weighting  factor,  -999  signifies  a missing data
value.  The "fitted background" is a constant value which in this case
has  been  subtracted  from  the "weighted sum" data values.  The "Raw
data - fitted background" values should be compared with  the  sum  of
the "Fitted slope" + "Fitted point source" values.
