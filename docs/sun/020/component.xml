  <description>ULDA/USSP --- Accessing the IUE Uniform Low-Dispersion Archive</description>
  <abstract><p>
     This describes how to access the IUE satellite's archive of
     reduced low-resolution spectra.  These data have been reduced in
     a fairly homogenous way using the IUE Project's Spectral Image
     Processing System (IUESIPS) and have been made available in the
     form of a Uniform Low-Dispersion Archive (ULDA). This
     comprises absolutely calibrated, extracted, low-dispersion
     spectra corrected for exposure times and with the appropriate ITF
     correction.

     In order to facilitate access to the ULDA, the ULDA Software
     Support Package (USSP) has been developed. The USSP enables
     astronomers to select interactively any images contained in the
     ULDA and provides facilities for efficient intercomputer data
     transfer. The USSP enables the searching of the ULDA data base
     for various types of images. For example, images can be selected
     on object class, image number, camera, aperture, homogeneous ID,
     sky position or any combination of these attributes. Users in the
     UK will use the USSP on the Starlink database Microvax (STADAT).
