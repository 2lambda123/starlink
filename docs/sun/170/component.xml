  <description>Editors on Unix</description>
  <abstract><p>
     The purpose of this document is to give new users advice on how
     to choose which editor to use on Unix machines. Under Unix the
     default editors are considered to be unfriendly and many users
     prefer to use other more sophisticated alternatives. However,
     many such alternatives exist; there is not one single editor that
     everyone finds acceptable and hence each user must decide for
     himself or herself which to adopt.
