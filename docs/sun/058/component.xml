  <description>IUEDA --- Access to the IUE data archive</description>
  <abstract><p>
     The International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite (IUE) is one of
     the most successful, versatile and productive astronomical
     satellites, providing ultraviolet spectra of a wide range of
     sources for the whole astronomical community. The UK hosts one of
     the three full archives of IUE data which is supported and
     maintained by members of the UK IUE Project in the Space Science
     Department at RAL. The archive comprises some 100,000 images,
     and a catalogue which gives details of the exposures. The aim is
     to provide UK astronomers with quick and painless access to IUE
     data. This document describes how to interrogate the catalogue
     and extract data from the archive.
