  <abstract><p>
    The Starlink Software Collection is a set of software which is
    managed and distributed by the Starlink Project.  Some of the
    software was written by members of the Project, but some of it
    comes from outside the Project.  This note describes the functions
    of the individual items in the Collection and provides an overview
    of the software so that readers can identify the items they need.

    The software is classified into four main divisions:

    Packages -- are large collections of programs for people who want
    to analyse, convert, and display data.  They are subdivided into
    eleven classes to help you find what you want.

    Utilities -- are small programs devoted to a specific purpose.
    For example, they help you prepare for observations, write
    documents, and write programs.

    Subroutine Libraries -- are for programmers writing astronomical
    software.  They provide facilities such as astronomical
    calculations, data management and graphics.

    Infrastructure -- are items which are mainly of interest to people
    writing programs within the Starlink Software Environment.  They
    are included for completeness.

    Each item is described in sufficient detail for you to decide
    whether or not to investigate it further. If you want to find out
    more about an item, follow the document references given opposite
    the item name. If you are using the hypertext version of this
    document, the most up-to-date document references can be found by
    following the link from the software item name.
