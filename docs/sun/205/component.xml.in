  <description>FORUM --- Starlink Conferencing Software</description>
  <abstract><p>

     FORUM is Starlink's conferencing software.  It is based on the
     World Wide Web (WWW) and provides similar capabilities under Unix
     to those provided by the DEC product VAXnotes under VMS.  Its
     main features are that it retains an archive of entries or notes,
     organized in a hierarchy, and it can restrict access.  Users can
     both read existing notes and submit new ones.  The hierarchy of
     entries, from the top down, is: `Conference', `Topic', `Reply'
     and `Riposte'.  One difference compared with VAXnotes is that
     while VAXnotes could maintain an index of all Conferences, even
     when the Conferences were located on separate systems at several
     Starlink sites, FORUM maintains an index only for each instance
     of FORUM.

     The best way to find out more about FORUM is to run it.  FORUM
     has also been described in a Starlink Bulletin} article, December
     1995.
