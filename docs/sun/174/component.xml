  <description>An Astronomer's Guide to On-line Bibliographic Databases and Information Services</description>
  <abstract><p>
     This document is a guide to on-line bibliographic databases and
     other information services which might be useful to astronomers.
     It concentrates on facilities which are either provided within
     the astronomical community, or which are available free of
     charge. For each facility listed a brief description is given,
     together with details of how to access it and how to obtain
     further information about it. The document aims to provide
     sufficient information for you to decide which facilities will be
     useful to you, and then obtain further information on them,
     rather than providing comprehensive documentation for each
     facility. It should be possible to access most of the facilities
     described here from Starlink computers. This document is
     complementary to SUN/162 which describes some of the observation
     and data archives available on-line.
