  <description>The EXOSAT Database System</description>
  <abstract><p>
     The purpose of this note is to alert users to the existence of
     the EXOSAT database system, to point them in the direction of the
     manuals and to provide a very quick guide to accessing the
     system. It is not intended to be a complete guide to all the
     facilities available, the on-line and paper documentation fill
     these needs.

     The EXOSAT database system is a relational database management
     system originally written by the EXOSAT observatory team and now
     being developed at the HEASARC in the Goddard Space Flight
     Centre. The database system has many associated astronomical
     databases. Some of these databases have data products associated
     with them, these may be plotted and analysed using software
     within the EXOSAT database system.
