\section{What is nu/TPU?}

nu/TPU is a fully programmable text processing utility compatible
with the TPU system found on VMS systems. People used to using
TPU or EDT on the former Starlink VAX/VMS service will find that
nu/TPU is very similar to these editors.

To invoke nu/TPU type tpu at the unix prompt i.e.

\begin{terminalv}
% tpu
\end{terminalv}

\section{Choosing an editor on Unix}

For information regarding which editors are available under Unix and
advice on which one to use, see \xref{SUN/170}{sun170}{}. This document contains
important warnings about the dangers of adopting nu/TPU as your default
editor under Unix.

\section{Further Information}

For more detailed information on using/configuring/programming nu/TPU,
ask your site manager for the reference manual published by a/Soft
Development Inc., which every Starlink site should have a copy of.
