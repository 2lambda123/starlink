  <description>SPLAT - A Spectral Analysis Tool</description>
  <abstract><p>

    SPLAT is a graphical tool for displaying, comparing, modifying and
    analysing astronomical spectra stored in NDF, FITS and TEXT files
    as well as the new NDX format. It can read in many spectra at the
    same time and then display these as line plots. Each display
    window, of which there can be many, can be used to view one or
    several spectra at the same time. Display windows can be
    interactively zoomed and scrolled, centred on specific
    wavelengths, provide continuous coordinate readout, annotated,
    produce printable hardcopy and be configured in many ways. They
    also provide the basis for interactive analysis facilities. All of
    these functions are displayed in a visually rich format, that is
    intended to appeal especially to casual users of spectral data
    analysis facilities, as it includes some facilities such as
    drag-and-drop and undo-able editing.

    The current set of analysis facilities include background
    estimation line fitting, filtering, and de-noising.  A database of
    laboratory line positions is available to aid in identification.

    SPLAT also supports a full range of coordinate systems for
    spectra, using the latest facilities of the Starlink AST library.
