  <description>UNIX: An Introduction</description>
  <abstract><p>
    This is a brief introduction to the Unix operating system as it is
    used in the Starlink Project.  It is aimed at users who are new to
    Unix and to Starlink.  Its purpose is to get you started quickly,
    so it is simple rather than comprehensive.

    It should be read in conjunction with any local guides provided at
    your local Starlink Site---these give details of the local
    facilities available and how to use them.  This is important
    because Starlink Sites differ in their computer hardware and in
    their versions of Unix.
