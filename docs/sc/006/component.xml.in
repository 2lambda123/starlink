  <description>The CCD Photometric Calibration Cookbook</description>
  <abstract><p>This cookbook presents simple recipes for the
      photometric calibration of CCD frames.  Using these recipes you
      can calibrate the brightness of objects measured in CCD frames
      into magnitudes in standard photometric systems, such as the
      Johnson-Morgan UBV, system. The recipes use standard
      software available at all Starlink sites.

      The topics covered include: selecting standard stars, measuring
      instrumental magnitudes and calibrating instrumental magnitudes
      into a standard system.  The recipes are appropriate for use
      with data acquired with optical CCDs and filters, operated in
      standard ways, and describe the usual calibration technique of
      observing standard stars.  The software is robust and reliable,
      but the techniques are usually not suitable where very high
      accuracy is required.

      In addition to the recipes and scripts, sufficient background
      material is presented to explain the procedures and techniques
      used.  The treatment is deliberately practical rather than
      theoretical, in keeping with the aim of providing advice on the
      actual calibration of observations.
