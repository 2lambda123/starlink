                          Example Data for SC/5
                          =====================


This directory contains the example data for SC/5: `The 2-D CCD Data
Reduction Cookbook'.   The data are R band observations of the spiral
galaxy NGC 2336 obtained with the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope (JKT) on
La Palma.  They were obtained from the CD-ROM `Astronomical Images' by
Walter Jaffe.  See SC/5 for further details.

The directory also contains some C-shell scripts for deleting intermediate
files generated during the reductions.  Again see SC/5 for details.
