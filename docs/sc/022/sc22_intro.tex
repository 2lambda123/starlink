\section{This cookbook}

This guide is designed to instruct POL-2 users on the best ways to
reduce and visualise their data using \starlink\ packages:
\smurf \cite{smurf}, \Kappa \cite{kappa}, polpack and \gaia \cite{gaia}.

This guide covers the following topics.
\begin{itemize}

\item \cref{Chapter}{sec:intro}{Chapter 1} -- Computer resources you'll need before getting started.
\item \cref{Chapter}{sec:pol2}{Chapter 2} -- A description of POL-2 and its observing modes.

\end{itemize}

Throughout this document, a percent sign (\texttt{\%}) is used to
represent the Unix shell prompt. What follows each \texttt{\%} will be
the text that should be typed by the user to initiate the described action.

\section{\xlabel{computing} Before you start: computing resources}
\label{sec:computing}

Unlike SCUBA-2 observations, POL-2 observations are far less memory intensive to reduce. 
Maps are down sampled to 2Hz within the reduction process. Assuming a typical 35 
minute POL-2 observation, the reduction requires 35 GB of memory (in comparison to SCUBA-2
maps that may require up to 96 GB of memory).

The main consideration for POL-2 reductions is processing power. PCA calculations in
makemap can be lengthy so a fast processors with lots of cores is advised.


\section{\xlabel{software}Before you start: software}

This manual uses software from the \starlink\ packages: \smurf\
\cite{smurf}, \Kappa\ \cite{kappa}, polpack and \gaia\ \cite{gaia}. 
Starlink software must be installed on your system, and Starlink 
aliases and environment variables must be defined before attempting 
to reduce any SCUBA-2 data.

\subsection{Data formats}
\label{sec:ndf}

Data files for POL-2 are the same as for SCUBA-2 and use 
the Starlink N-dimensional Data Format (NDF,
see Jenness et al.\ 2014\cite{ndf}), a hierarchical format which allows
additional data and metadata to be stored within a single file. \Kappa\
contains \xref{many commands}{sun95} {ap_classified}\ for examining and
manipulating NDF structures. The introductory sections of the \Kappa\
document (\xref{SUN/95}{sun95}{}) contain much useful information on
the contents of an NDF structure and how to manipulate them.

A single NDF structure describes a single data array with associated
meta-data. NDFs are usually stored within files of type ``\verb+.sdf+''.
In most cases (but not all), a single \verb+.sdf+ file will contain just
one top-level NDF structure, and the NDF can be referred to simply by
giving the name of the file (with or without the ``\verb+.sdf+'' prefix).
In many cases, a top-level NDF containing JCMT data will contain other
``extension'' NDFs buried inside them at a lower level. For instance, raw
files contain a number of NDF components which store observation-specific
data necessary for subsequent processing. The contents of these (and
other NDF) files may be listed with \HDSTRACEref. Each file holding raw
JCMT data on disk is also known as a `sub-scan'.

The main components of any NDF structure are:
\begin{itemize}
\item An array of numerical data (may have up to seven
dimensions---usually three for JCMT data);
\item An array of variance values corresponding to the numerical data
values;
\item An array holding up to eight boolean flags (known as ``quality
flags'') for each pixel;
\item World Coordinate System information;
\item History;
\item Data units
\item Other extensions items. These are defined by particular packages,
but usually include a list of FITS-like headers together with provenance
information that indicates how the NDF was created. Raw JCMT file also
include extensions that define the state of the telescope and instrument
at each time slice within the observation.
\end{itemize}

The \convert\ package contains commands \xref{\task{fits2ndf}}{sun55}{FITS2NDF} and
\xref{\task{ndf2fits}}{sun55}{NDF2FITS} that allow interchange between FITS
and NDF format.

\subsection{Initialising Starlink}
\label{sec:starinit}

The commands and environment variables needed to start up the required
Starlink packages (\smurf \cite{smurf}, \Kappa, \emph{etc.}) must first
be defined. For C shells (csh, tcsh), do:

\begin{terminalv}
% setenv STARLINK_DIR <path to the starlink installation>
% source $STARLINK_DIR/etc/login
% source $STARLINK_DIR/etc/cshrc
\end{terminalv}

before using any Starlink commands. For Bourne shells (sh, bash, zsh), do:

\begin{terminalv}
% export STARLINK_DIR=<path to the starlink installation>
% source $STARLINK_DIR/etc/profile
\end{terminalv}

\subsection{KAPPA and SMURF for data processing}
\label{sec:packinit}

The Sub-Millimetre User Reduction Facility, or \textsc{Smurf},
contains the Dynamic Iterative Map-Maker, which will process raw
SCUBA-2 data into images (see \smurfsun). \textsc{Kappa} meanwhile is
an application package comprising general-purpose commands mostly for
manipulating and visualising NDF data (see \kappasun). Before starting
any data reduction you will want to initiate both \textsc{Smurf} and
\textsc{Kappa}.

\begin{terminalv}
% smurf
% kappa
\end{terminalv}

After entering the above commands, you can access the help information
for either package by typing \texttt{smurfhelp} or
\texttt{kaphelp} respectively in a terminal, or by using the
\task{showme} facility to access the hypertext documentation. See
\cref{Section}{sec:help}{How to get help} for more information.



\begin{tip}
The .sdf extension on filenames need not be specified when running most
Starlink commands (the exception is \picard).
\end{tip}


\subsection{GAIA for viewing your map}

Image visualisation can be done with \gaia\ (see
\gaiasun). \textsc{Gaia} is a GUI-driven image and data-cube display and
analysis tool, which incorporates facilities such as source detection,
three-dimensional visualisation, photometry and the ability to query
and overlay on-line or local catalogues.
\begin{terminalv}
% gaia map.sdf
\end{terminalv}

Alternatively, the \Kappa\ package includes many visualisation commands
that can be run from the shell comand-line or incorporated easily into your
own scripts---see Appendix ``\xref{Classified KAPPA commands}{sun95}{cl_datadisplay}''
in SUN/95. These tools are particularly useful for creating more complex
composite plots including multiple images, line-plots, \emph{etc}, such
as the multi-image plots in \cref{Section}{sec:itermaps}{Monitoring the
map at the end of each iteration}.

\hline
\task{showme} & If you know the name of the Starlink document you want to view,
                use \task{showme}. When run, it launches a new webpage or tab
                displaying the hypertext version of the document. &
\texttt{\%~showme~sun95}\\
\hline
\task{findme} & \task{findme} searches Starlink documents for a keyword. When
                run, it launches a new webpage or tab listing the results. &
                \texttt{\% findme~kappa}\\
\hline
\task{docfind} & \task{docfind} searches the internal list files for keywords. It then
                 searches the document titles. The result is displayed using the
                 Unix \task{more} command. & \texttt{\%~docfind~kappa}\\
\hline
Run routines with prompts & You can run any routine with the option
                            \texttt{prompt} after the command. This will
                            prompt for every parameter available. If you
                            then want a further description of any parameter
                            type  \texttt{?} at the relevant prompt. &
                            \texttt{\%~makemap~prompt~\newline\~\%~REF~-~Ref.~NDF~/!/$>$~?}\\
\hline
Google & A simple Google search such as ``\texttt{starlink kappa fitslist}''
will usually return links to the appropriatre documents. However, be
aware that the results may include links to out of date versions of the
document hosted at non-Starlink sites. Always look for results in
\texttt{"www.starlink.ac.uk/docs} (or \texttt{"www.starlink.ac.uk/devdocs}
for the cutting-edge development version of the document). & \\
