\chapter{\xlabel{pca_scuba2}PCA on SCUBA-2 data}
\label{app:pca}

This document has outlined the process of reducing POL-2 data and its
reliance on PCA during the makemap process. There are two main reasons
why running makemap with PCA is not the default method for all data observed
using SCUBA-2:

\begin{enumerate}
\item it is very time-consuming to run because of the faster scanning speed
and consequent higher sample rate of non-POL-2 data; and
\item for non-POL-2 data, it produces similar results to running the default
makemap with a decreased filter size.
\end{enumerate}

All the relevant tools are still provided however, and so interested users
may wish to try using this method and to compare the results.
