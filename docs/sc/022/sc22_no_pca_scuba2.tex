\chapter{\xlabel{pca_scuba2}PCA on SCUBA-2 data}
\label{app:pca}

This document has outlined the process of reducing POl-2 data and its
reliance on PCA during the makemap process.There are two main reasons 
why runnign makemap with PCA is not the default method for all data observed
using SCUBA-2. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is time consuming to run
\item Produces similar results to running the default makemap as 
is obtained by simply increasing the filter size.
\end{enumerate}

The tools however are still provided and so those wo are interested
may use this method to compare results.
