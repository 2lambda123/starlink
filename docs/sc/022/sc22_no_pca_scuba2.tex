\chapter{\xlabel{pca_scuba2}PCA on SCUBA-2 data}
\label{app:pca}

This document has outlined the process of reducing POL-2 data and its
reliance on PCA during the makemap process. There are two main reasons 
why running make-map with PCA is not the default method for all data observed
using SCUBA-2:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is time-consuming to run;
\item It produces similar results to running the default makemap with an increasing the filter size.
\end{enumerate}

All the relevant tools are still provided however, and so interested users
may wish to try using this method and to compare the results.
