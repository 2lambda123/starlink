  <description>The DX Cookbook</description>
  <abstract><p>IBM DX (Data Explorer) is the data visualisation package
     recommended by Starlink, particularly for the visualisation of
     three-dimensional scalar and vector data. This cookbook provides
     a set of simple recipes for performing common operations using
     DX. No prior knowledge of DX is required. You can use the recipes
     as they are provided, if they are suitable for your purposes, or
     alternatively you can use them as a starting point for generating
     your own visualisations.

     The cookbook also contains a brief summary of the DX data model.
     It is useful to have at least some understanding of this data
     model in order to use DX effectively.
