Demo programs for SC/13.@SC13VERSION@

To build all the example programs, give the commands

    ./configure
    make

Some of the programs in here require specific compiler options.

The configure script should sort these out, but if it fails you might need to
specify them by hand as arguments to the configure script.  For example:

    ./configure --enable-profiling=-pg --enable-nounderscore=-ext_names=plain

If you have to resort to this, please let norman@astro.gla.ac.uk know
of the options you had to add, and the compiler type reported by the
configure script.
