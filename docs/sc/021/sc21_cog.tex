\chapter{\xlabel{cog}Aperture-photometry Curve of Growth}
\label{app:cog}

The SCUBA-2 beam has a broad error beam. As the size of the annulus
changes, the contribution from the error beam scales according to the
curve-of-growth---see \cref{Figure}{fig:cog}{the figure below}. To correct for an
aperture size differing from 60-arcsec diameter you should read off the
appropriate scaling factor for your FCF from the graph below.
