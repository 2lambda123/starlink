\label{app:checkrmsparams}

The \picard\ recipe \drrecipe{SCUBA2\_CHECK\_RMS} estimates the RMS
and NEFD for a given observation via two methods to compare with
values from the SCUBA-2 integration time calculator (ITC).

The average NEP is calculated from the QL pipeline log file
(\file{log.nep}) corresponding to the date and wavelength. The FCF
(either from the file or the standard value) and mean transmission
over the observation is used to convert this to a zenith NEFD
(NEFD\_NEP). The elapsed time is used to convert that to an RMS noise
(RMS\_NEP).

The input images are cropped to the given size (as specified in the
FITS headers or via the MAP\_HEIGHT and MAP\_WIDTH recipe parameters)
before the mean exposure time is derived, along with the mean/median
noise and NEFD (RMS\_MAP and NEFD\_MAP).

The RMS corresponding to the observation type is calculated from the
SCUBA-2 ITC (RMS\_ITC); the time is used to convert that to a
corresponding NEFD (NEFD\_ITC).

The parameters written out to \file{log.checkrms} are listed below:
