\section{\xlabel{introduction}Introduction}
\label{introduction}

This paper specifies Starlink's policy for distributing the Starlink Software
Collection, both within Starlink, and to non-Starlink sites in the UK and 
around the world.

It applies to all software distributed by Starlink and to all recipients
whether they be UK Starlink site managers or individuals at observatories 
and universities.

Starlink distinguishes between \textbf{\textit{non-commercial
software}} usually written by astronomers or Starlink contract
programmers, and \textbf{\textit{commercial software}} which is used
under license or has been bought.  

The collection also contains some packages which have their own
distribution conditions, most notably those covered by the GNU Public
Licence.  Where this is the case the GNU Public Licence or other
licence conditions take precedence over the Starlink licence.

\section{\xlabel{non-commercial_software}Non-commercial Software}
\label{non-commercial_software}

The \textbf{\textit{non-commercial software}} consists of software
from sources including astronomers in the UK and abroad, `Public
Domain' and GNU licensed packages, and some major astronomical
reduction systems such as IRAF and AIPS.  

\subsection{\xlabel{astronomical_software}Astronomical software}
\label{astronomical_software}

Most of the Starlink software is astronomical packages, libraries and 
utilities.  The collection has built up over the years from contributions
submitted to Starlink by their authors `for the common good' or written 
by Starlink contract programmers.

It is hard in some cases to assign `ownership' to each package or part
or a package since many individuals have contributed to the evolution
of such packages over the years.  Nevertheless, the Starlink Project
has decided that by default, software in the collection will be covered
by the Starlink Terms and conditions.

Where individuals and institutions outside Starlink have an interest 
in a particular package, Starlink acknowledges their interest whilst
continuing to distribute the software.

Each package in the collection should have its own copy of the
Terms and Conditions.  In cases where ownership is easy to assign or
establish, the Terms and Conditions will be the standard Starlink conditions
or the terms and conditions required by the authors(s).

Most of the \textbf{\textit{non-commercial software}} is distributed 
by the Starlink Project on CD-ROM\@.  The distribution is revised, rebuilt and
reissued twice a year in Spring and Autumn.

Major elements such as IRAF and AIPS are not distributed but are provided
on FTP mirror sites at RAL (IRAF) or Manchester (AIPS).

In general, the Starlink software is distributed for non-profit use in
astronomical research and is free of distribution and media charges.

The full conditions under which \textbf{\textit{non-commercial\/}}
Starlink software is distributed to non-Starlink sites are given in
\latexhtml{appendix~\ref{conditions_of_use}.}{the \htmlref{Conditions
of Use}{conditions_of_use} section.}

Non-Starlink sites and individuals wanting to obtain copies of the CD-ROM
sets should contact the CD-ROM distribution email address:

\begin{quote}
\htmladdnormallink{\texttt{cdrom@star.rl.ac.uk}}{mailto:cdrom@star.rl.ac.uk}
\end{quote}

specifying which of the available distributions is required.  Details
of the available distributions can be found on the Starlink CD-ROM
page:

\begin{quote}
\htmladdnormallink{\texttt{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cdrom/cdrom.html}}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cdrom/cdrom.html}
\end{quote}

\section{\xlabel{commercial_software}Commercial Software}
\label{commercial_software}

The Starlink Project provides various commercial packages for use at the
sites, and makes use of `bulk' licensing agreements where possible.
However the licences do not permit Starlink to distribute the software 
outside Starlink sites so users at non-Starlink sites who wish to use a
particular package will have to make their own licensing arrangements.

Starlink distributes the commercial software for which it has licences 
using a private distribution mechanism.  For details, please contact the 
Starlink Software Librarian.

Contact details for the packages Starlink has licences for are given in 
\latexhtml{appendix~\ref{commercial_software_contact_addresses}}{the 
\htmlref{Commercial software contact addresses}{commercial_software_contact_addresses} 
section.}

The licensing details for each commercial software package in the Starlink
Software Collection is described in more detail below.


\begin{description}

\item[CLUSTAN]\mbox{}

This software is licensed for five Starlink sites: Birmingham, Cambridge,
Durham, Edinburgh and RAL\@.  It may not be installed at other Starlink sites 
or be distributed to non-Starlink sites.

\item[FORCHECK and SPAG]\mbox{}

FORCHECK and SPAG are licensed for the Starlink central Unix service at RAL
and may not be redistributed.

\item[IDL]\mbox{}

IDL is licensed site-by-site according to the requirements at the site -- each
site has its own licence.  IDL may not be redistributed.

\item[MAPLE]\mbox{}

This software is licensed for the the Starlink central Unix service only 
and may not be distributed to other sites.

\item[MEMSYS Libraries]\mbox{}

Starlink's licence for the MEMSYS libraries permits the software to be
distributed to the UK Starlink sites and the three UK National Observatory
sites: the Anglo Australian Observatory, the Issac Newton Group on La Palma 
and the Joint Astronomy Center, Hawaii.  MEMSYS may not be distributed outside
these sites.

In addition, access is strictly controlled by site managers to users who
have signed a copy of the \emph{Memsys Starlink Academic User's Licence
Agreement}.  Copies may be obtained from the Starlink Software Librarian
or from the MEMSYS distribution.  Completed Licence Agreements should be
returned to the Starlink Software Librarian at RAL.

\item[NAG Libraries and Compiler]\mbox{}

Starlink has a 5-year licence commencing 1 April 1999 which provides 
the NAG Fortran 77 Numerical and Graphics Libraries and the Fortran 
\texttt{f95} compiler for Linux.  The licence covers all machines in
the Starlink network in the UK\@.  The Libraries and compiler may not be
redistributed.

Programs (binaries) linked using the Linux \texttt{f95} compiler may be 
copied to any Linux machine accompanied by the required run time libraries
buy the compiler itself and its support systems may not be copied.

Programs linked with the NAG Numerical Libraries may not be distributed 
or copied to sites or machines that are not covered by a NAG licence.

Distributions of the NAG products are provided by the Starlink Software 
Librarian.

\item[NCAR graphics library]\mbox{}

The NCAR graphics library was originally distributed as `public domain'
software.  However the status of NCAR was changed in 1986 and newer
versions of NCAR are not in the `public domain'.  Commercial distribution
is prohibited.

Starlink's view is that the Starlink Software distribution is not a
commercial distribution and Starlink is entitled to use and distribute
the (old) Starlink version of the NCAR library. 

The Starlink version has been ported to Unix from VMS and various minor
internal modifications made to adapt it to our requirements.  It has not
been `updated' since 1986.  Use of the NCAR libraries is being dropped
from the USSC packages.

\item[SM plotting package]\mbox{}

The Starlink licence for SM covers all Starlink machines.  The authors
have agreed that use of SM on PCs (\emph{e.g} laptops and home PCs) by
users registered at UK Starlink sites is covered by the licence.  SM
may not be distributed further.  Users who cease to be registered at a
UK Starlink site cease to be covered by the Starlink licence.


\item[XV image viewer]\mbox{}

Starlink's licence for the XV image viewer covers all machines owned, 
operated or maintained by the Project.  It may not be redistributed.

Distributions are provided for Starlink sites by the Starlink Software
Librarian.
