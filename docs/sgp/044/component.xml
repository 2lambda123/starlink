  <description>Guidelines for Starlink Software Strategy Groups</description>
  <abstract><p>
     Software Strategy Groups (SSGs) are Starlink user groups which
     have been set up by the Project to allow it to consult with
     expert software users and to obtain advice about those software
     issues which affect the use of its computing service.  The SSGs
     also form an important part of a procedure for annually re-assessing
     the software priorities of the Project and for identifying future
     objectives.

     This document describes the nature of the SSGs and the role which
     they play in this procedure. It also covers some administrative
     arrangements.  Its primary purpose is to give guidance to those
     participating in SSGs, so that they can operate as effectively as
     possible.
