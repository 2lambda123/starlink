  <description>Starlink Application Programming Standard</description>
  <abstract><p>
    This Programming Standard should be read by all those who implement
    programs on Starlink computers.  The techniques described are
    requirements for Starlink-supported applications software but are equally
    appropriate for private programming.  The standard applies mainly
    to the implementation of freestanding VAX/VMS and Unix
    applications, but also includes some material specific to developing
    programs for the Starlink ADAM Software Environment.
