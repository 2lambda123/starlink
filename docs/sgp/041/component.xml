  <description>Local Management Arrangements</description>
  <abstract><p>
     In July 1993, the Starlink Panel reviewed the existing local
     management arrangements, based on the Area Management Committees
     (AMCs), and decided to introduce a number of reforms.  The new
     arrangements, which are the subject of this paper, concentrate
     the old AMC responsibilities into one individual at each site
     called the Site Chairman, leaving it up to that individual to set
     up the consultative machinery appropriate to his or her
     community.  Sites normally opt to set up committees much like the
     old LMCs or AMCs, but adapted to suit local needs.

     A prospective Site Chairman proposes and agrees with the Starlink
     Project Scientist local procedures for consulting and
     representing users which are acceptable to both Starlink and the
     Institution.  The effectiveness of these procedures is kept under
     review; accreditation of the Site Chairman is renewed annually.
