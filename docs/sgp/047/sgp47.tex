This document is designed as an aid to those who need to find, or use,
software for computer algebra.
Some of the text is based on a review undertaken to determine whether
the existing Starlink provision for computer algebra is sufficient and
appropriate.
At present there is a copy of Maple, available to anyone with a Starlink
account, on the central stadat machine.

The document compares the two main packages available for computer algebra,
gives short descriptions of other popular packages, includes a list of
`pointers' to other sources of information, and offers some general hints

\section{\xlabel{maple_mathematica}\label{se_maple_mathematica}Maple and
         Mathematica}
\markboth{\stardocname}{Maple \& Mathematica}

The two major software packages available for computer algebra are Maple
and Mathematica.  Both Packages are commercial and have similar
capabilities.  Both packages are available for a wide range of operating
systems, including those which Starlink supports.


\subsection{Maple}

Maple is the on-going product of a research project at the University of
Waterloo in Canada.  Maple was first developed by the authors in the early
1980s in response to their perception that the (then) existing software in
the field was inadequate.
The current version is Maple V Release~4.

Maple is a general-purpose package for mathematical manipulation.
It is programmable, and the source code for its internal routines is
available as part of the package.
This allows easy inspection of the algorithms used in standard functions,
and adaption of these functions to similar tasks.
The program has extensive support for graphical display of functions and
equations etc., on-screen, in a manner resembling normal mathematical
notation.

Waterloo Maple have a set of world-wide web pages which start at:

\begin{itemize}

\item \htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://www.mathematics.com/}}
      {http://www.mathematics.com/}

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Mathematica}

Mathematica is a product of Wolfram Research Inc.\ founded by the
`architect' of the system, Stephen Wolfram.  Mathematica first appeared in
1988.  The most recent release is Version 3.0 which is styled as the
`World's only fully integrated technical computing system'.
Wolfram are well known for their no-holds-barred hype.

Mathematica, like Maple, offers capabilities for symbolic and numerical
computations.  Numeric computations can be carried out to `arbitrary'
precision, though obviously the higher the precision, the more time required
to complete the calculation.  There is a full suite of functions supporting
2- and 3-dimensional plotting of data and functions.  Mathematica
incorporates a graphics language capability which can be used to produce
visualisations of complex objects.

There is an {\sl Applications Library} available which includes a range of
application-tailored tools written in Mathematica's language.  These include:
a 3-D real-time graphics tool; a control-system tool; an experimental data
analyser; mechanical, electrical, and signal analysers.  There are also
packages for financial work.

There have been several papers and reviews critical of Mathematica; this
is at least partly due to the marketing strategy of the company.  At least
some of these critical reviews have turned on the debate about the difference
between accuracy and precision (sic).  There is an extensive
review available via FTP\cite{fateman}\@.

Wolfram have a set of world-wide web pages which start at:

\begin{itemize}

\item \htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://www.wri.com/}}{http://www.wri.com/}

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Comparison of Maple \& Mathematica}

Maple and Mathematica have largely the same capabilities in the area
of computer algebra, however, they do differ in some important ways,
reflecting their designs.

Both Mathematica and Maple provide on-line help facilities which document
their capabilities.  These help facilities are useful for locating
functions (and functionality) you might require.  The on-line help for
Maple is more extensive than that in Mathematica, providing examples and
cross-references not normally present in the Mathematica help.

Maple is written in its own programming language and this source is
available to the user who can inspect and modify the code, perhaps
adapting the code to specific requirements.  The source code for
Mathematica is written in C and is not generally available.

Programming in the two systems is different.  The Maple language is
similar in style to Pascal.
Mathematica supports several styles of programming:
object-oriented, procedural, rule-based and functional.
The naming convention for internal functions in Maple is less consistent
than that of Mathematica.
All built-in Mathematica functions start with a capital letter.
Built-in Maple functions can be fully upper-case, capitalised or fully
lower-case.

Mathematica has a large, monolithic kernel and can take a small amount of
time to load into memory.
Maple, on the other hand, is modular in design;
the Maple kernel loads functions into memory on demand and thus can be
expected to generally run in less memory than Mathematica.  This would
only be a problem if the system is expected to run on a PC with less than
32 Megabytes of RAM\@.

Both Maple and Mathematica support output of equations and the like
in \LaTeX\ format.

\subsection{Maple or Mathematica?}

It's difficult to make a firm recommendation of either Maple or
Mathematica\sgspec{---}{ - }it depends on what you want to do, what
hardware you have available, and so on.  It may be the case that the
various `frills' which Mathematica offers will be of use to you,
for example, the provision of the ability to manifest a function
in sound.

University-based individuals might investigate local expertise in one or
both of the packages; there is no substitute for a local guru when trying
to get something to work.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\xlabel{starlink_maple}\label{se_starlink_maple}Central Starlink
         Maple Service}
\markboth{\stardocname}{The Central Starlink Maple service}

Starlink provides a central Maple service for those who do not have access
to computer algebra facilities at their Starlink site.
The system is installed on the stadat machine at RAL.
If you do not already have access to the machine\sgspec{---}{ - }some
Starlink sites may have a single account for all their
users\sgspec{---}{ - }you will have to apply for an account (not as painful
as it might sound).
The service, how to access it, and an introduction to usage, can be found in
the Starlink document \xref{SUN/107, {\sl Maple\sgspec{---}{ - }Mathematical
Manipulation Language}}{sun107}{}\@.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\xlabel{other_software}\label{se_other_software}Other Software}
\markboth{\stardocname}{Other Software}

At the time of writing there are no packages of comparable capabilities and
widespread use as Maple and Mathematica.
Both products attempt to be market leaders and undergo continuous development.
There are many packages with subsets of the capabilities available and these
are comprehensively listed in a database maintained at Berkeley (see the
\htmlref{Appendix}{se_packages}).

There is a newsgroups which may be of interest to those investigating
computer algebra software:

\begin{itemize}

\item \htmladdnormallink{{\tt news:sci.math.symbolic}}{sci.math.symbolic}

\end{itemize}

The appendix data are drawn from the extensive on-line database about
mathematical software at Berkeley.  The source file is:

\begin{itemize}

\item \htmladdnormallink{\tt
        ftp://math.berkeley.edu/pub/Symbolic\_Soft/Available\_Systems}
       {ftp://math.berkeley.edu/pub/Symbolic_Soft/Available_Systems}

\end{itemize}

There is more extensive information available on many of these packages
at this site.

One package mentioned only very briefly in the Appendix is MathSoft's
{\sl MathCad.}  MathCad offers many of the facilities present in Maple
and Mathematica, its symbolic technology is actually based on that of
maple.  MathCad is available for MS-Windows and Macintosh systems.
MathCad's world-wide web homepage is:

\begin{itemize}

\item \htmladdnormallink{\tt http://www.mathsoft.com/all60.htm}
       {http://www.mathsoft.com/all60.htm}

\end{itemize}

Per Bergehed maintains a `Math Software' web page which is a useful
resource:

\begin{itemize}

\item \sgspec{{\tt

\markboth{\stardocname}{Algebra Software Packages}

{\sl Only those packages from the software list with computer algebra
capabilities, and available for PCs or Starlink-supported operating
systems, are included.  Some lengthy lists of supported operating systems
have been removed.}

This is the  list of  currently  developed  and   distributed   software  for
symbolic mathematical applications. It was started a few years ago by  Booker
Bense of the UC San Diego Supercomputer Center. He is responsible for     the
lay-out and for the idea of collecting this database. Most of the information
here is obtained from the developers and we try to keep it up to date, a  not
so easy task.

Electronic mail concerning this database and additions to it could be

  Comments:  GANITH is an algebraic geometry toolkit, for the computation
             and visualization of solutions to systems of algebraic
             equations.
             Example applications of this for geometric modeling and
             computer graphics are algebraic curve and surface
             display, curve-curve intersections, surface-surface
             intersections, global and local parameterizations,
             implicitization.
             GANITH also incorporates techniques for interpolation and
             least-squares approximation (multivariate data fitting)
             with algebraic curves and surfaces.
             Version 1 of GANITH is available from anonymous FTP at
             ftp.cs.purdue.edu in the file /pub/shastra/ganith-sun.tar.Z
