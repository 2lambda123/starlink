  <description>Computer Algebra Software</description>
  <abstract><p>
     This document is designed as an aid to those who need to find, or
     use, software for computer algebra. Some of the text is based on
     a review undertaken to determine whether the existing Starlink
     provision for computer algebra is sufficient and appropriate. At
     present there is a copy of Maple, available to anyone with a
     Starlink account, on the central stadat machine.

     The document compares the two main packages available for
     computer algebra, gives short descriptions of other popular
     packages, includes a list of `pointers' to other sources of
     information, and offers some general hints on selecting software.
