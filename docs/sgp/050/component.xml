  <description>Starlink Document Styles</description>
  <abstract><p>
     This document describes the various styles which are recommended
     for Starlink documents. It also explains how to use the templates
     which are provided by Starlink to help authors create documents
     in a standard style.
     
     This paper is concerned mainly with conveying the "look and
     feel" of the various styles of Starlink document rather than
     describing the technical details of how to produce them. Other
     Starlink papers give recommendations for the detailed aspects of
     document production, design, layout, and typography.
     
     The only style that is likely to be used by most Starlink authors
     is the Standard style.
