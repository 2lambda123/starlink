                     ----------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

JPL have for many years distributed definitive solar system ephemeris
tapes, containing files of ephemeris data plus Fortran programs to
read and interpolate them.  The ephemerides are generated by direct
numerical integration of the equations of motion of the large bodies
in the solar system, subject to fitting to a variety of observations.
The JPL ephemeris distributed by Starlink is the DE200/LE200, which is
the one most consistent with the latest IAU resolutions.  It is
described in detail on pp S26-8 of the 1984 Astronomical Almanac.

The following items are supplied as part of the Starlink Software
Collection:

     1.  A copy of the JPL tape.

     2.  A set of subroutines, both as source and as an object
         library.  Only three are of direct interest to the user:
         PLEPH, XSTATE and XCONST.

     3.  Utility programs for copying the ephemeris files from tape to
         disc (READ66), for generating subsets (XSHORT), and for
         demonstrating the PLEPH subroutine (JPLPLEPH).

     4.  The ephemeris, as a disc file, covering 1960-2000.

     5.  This document, in RUNOFF form etc.

     6.  The document "JPL Export Ephemeris User's Guide", hardcopy
         only.

The tape contains both the full 1800-2050 span and a shorter version
covering 1960-2000, the latter being provided on disc so that the
typical user need never be concerned with tape handling.  The full
1800-2050 is available on disc on the Starlink Database MicroVAX

STADAT.

No utility programs for interrogating the ephemeris are currently
provided (beyond some simple examples);  access is via subroutine
calls from the user's own program.  To obtain, for example, the
barycentric position and velocity of the Earth, all it is necessary to
do is the following:

     1.  Write a Fortran program including the statements:

                DOUBLE PRECISION TDB,PV(6)
                        :
                CALL PLEPH(TDB,3,12,PV)

         (Details of the PLEPH arguments are given later.)

     2.  Compile and link with JPLDIR:JPL/L

     3.  $ ASSIGN/USER JPLDIR:DE200.DAT FOR012

     4.  Run the program.

The JPL DE200/LE200 ephemeris is based on the mean equatorial triad of
J2000.0, and all positions and velocities produced by the
interrogation routines will be in this coordinate system, which is the
fundamental reference frame specified in the IUA 1976 resolutions.
The 6-vectors produced have elements x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt in a
righthanded Cartesian coordinate system with the x-axis aligned to the
first point of Aries and the z-axis to the North celestial pole.  The
units are AU and AU/day by default;  optionally, km and km/sec can be
selected.



2  HOW TO INTERROGATE AN EPHEMERIS

This is the one capability of interest to typical users.  Two routines
are provided:

      o  PLEPH, which is simple to use and gives the coordinates of a
         single body.

      o  XSTATE, which is more flexible, and suitable for cases where
         the coordinates of several bodies are required at once.

The two routines are described separately.



2.1  The PLEPH Subroutine

PLEPH reads and interpolates a single item - usually the position and

                                - 2 -
SUN/87.4                                                        Page 3


velocity of one body relative to another - from a JPL ephemeris file
on disc.  The call is:

      CALL PLEPH (TDB, NP, NC, R)

The given arguments are as follows:

   TDB  double precision   The moment of time:  the barycentric
                           dynamical time, TDB, expressed as the
                           modified Julian Date (JD - 2400000.5).

   NP   integer            The body or reference point whose
                           coordinates are required (see the list,
                           below).

   NC   integer            The origin of the coordinate system - the
                           same scheme as for NP.

Returned:

   R    double precision   6-element array containing position and
                           velocity:  x,y,z,dx/dt,dy/dt,dz/dt.

The NP and NC arguments are each as follows:

      1            Mercury
      2            Venus
      3            Earth
      4            Mars
      5            Jupiter
      6            Saturn
      7            Uranus
      8            Neptune
      9            Pluto
     10            Moon
     11            Sun
     12            SSB
     13            EMB

In each case, the position and velocity of the point specified by NP
relative to the point specified by NC are put into R(1-6).

For example, the following call will obtain the position and velocity
of the Earth relative to the Solar System barycentre at 0 hours TDB on
30 April 1986:

        CALL PLEPH (46550D0, 3, 12, R)

(Starting from a date and time in UTC, the TDB argument can be
obtained by first converting the date to an MJD by means of the SLALIB
subroutine sla_CALDJ, correcting to TDT by means of the function
sla_DTA and - in critical cases - correcting to TDB by means of the

                                - 3 -
SUN/87.4                                                        Page 4


function sla_RCC.  The SLALIB library is described in SUN/67.)

Errors - TDB out of range or illegal NP, NC value - are indicated by
all elements of the result array R being set to zero.

PLEPH can return results in either AU and AU/day or km and km/sec.
The default is AU and AU/day;  to select the other units, include the
following Fortran statements:

        LOGICAL KM
        COMMON /STCOMM/ KM
                :
                :
        KM=.TRUE.

Calls to PLEPH will then return results in km and km/sec.

PLEPH can also be used to read the JPL values for the nutation angles
(NP,NC=14,0);  however, the Starlink routine sla_NUTC is more
convenient in typical cases.



2.2  The XSTATE Subroutine

The basic interpolating routine supplied by JPL is XSTATE, which
offers more flexibility and marginally greater efficiency than the
PLEPH routine just described.  In particular, XSTATE allows the
coordinates of several bodies to be determined at once.
The call is:

      CALL XSTATE (JD, LIST, PV, NUT, IFL)

The given arguments are as follows:

   JD    is a 2-element double precision array specifying the
         instant of time for which the interpolations are to be
         done, in the TDB timescale.  The time is the sum
         JD(1)+JD(2).  A variety of different combinations of the
         two elements is possible.  The simplest is to put the
         whole Julian Date into JD(1) and to set JD(2) to zero.
         For optimum precision, set JD(1) to the Julian Date at
         the previous 0 hours TDB (so JD(1) will be 24xxxxx.5D0)
         and JD(2) to the fraction of a day from 0 hours to the
         required time.  JD(1) values far distant from the
         interpolation time (in particular example outside the
         range of the ephemeris) can cause crashes.

   LIST  is an 11-element integer array specifying what
         interpolation is wanted for each of the bodies (or
         reference points) on the file:


                                - 4 -
SUN/87.4                                                        Page 5


                  LIST(I) = 0: no interpolation for body I
                          = 1: position only
                          = 2: position and velocity

         The I values are as follows:

                        I = 1: Mercury
                          = 2: Venus
                          = 3: Earth-Moon barycentre
                          = 4: Mars
                          = 5: Jupiter
                          = 6: Saturn
                          = 7: Uranus
                          = 8: Neptune
                          = 9: Pluto
                          =10: Moon (geocentric)
                          =11: Nutations in longitude and obliquity

Returned as arguments:

   PV    is a (6,10) double precision array that will contain
         the requested interpolated quantities.  The body
         specified by LIST(I) will have its state in the array
         starting at PV(1,I).  (On any given call, only those
         elements in PV which have been requested are set; the
         rest of the PV array is untouched.)  The order of
         components starting in PV(1,I) is x,y,z,dx/dt,dy/dt,dz/dt.
         All output vectors are referenced to the mean equator
         and equinox of B1950.0 for DE#'s < 200 and of J2000.0
         for DE#'s >= 200.  The Moon state is always geocentric;
         the other nine states are either heliocentric or
         Solar-system barycentric, depending on the setting of
         COMMON flags (see below).

   NUT   is a 4-element double precision array that will contain
         nutations and rates, depending on the setting of LIST(11).
         The order of quantities in NUT is:

                       d psi  (nutation in longitude)
                       d epsilon (nutation in obliquity)
                       d psi dot
                       d epsilon dot

         (Note - there are no nutations on some JPL ephemerides,
         for example DE102.)

   IFL   is an integer error indicator:

                      IFL = 0: OK
                          = 1: JD too small
                          = 2: JD too big


                                - 5 -

Other information is given in the labelled COMMON block /STCOMM/:

   KM    is a flag of type logical defining the physical units
         of the output states:

                       KM = .TRUE.  gives km and km/sec
                          = .FALSE. gives AU and AU/day (the default)

         (KM also determines the time unit for the nutation rates;
         the angle unit is always radians.)

   BARY  is a flag of type logical defining the origin of the
         results;  only the nine planets are affected:

                      BARY = .TRUE.,  Solar system barycentric
                           = .FALSE., heliocentric (the default)

   PVSUN is a 6-element double precision array containing the
         barycentric position and velocity of the Sun.  The
         position coordinates are always km (never AU, even if
         KM=.FALSE.), but the units of velocity do depend on KM
         (.TRUE. gives km/sec, .FALSE. gives km/day).



3  HOW TO OBTAIN THE CONSTANTS OF AN EPHEMERIS

Should it be necessary to examine the constants that were used to
generate a particular JPL ephemeris - planetary masses, conversion
factors, range of dates covered, etc - this can be done by means of
the subroutine XCONST.  The call is as follows:

      CALL XCONST (NAM, VAL, SS, N)

and returns the following:

   NAM   is an integer array of dimension (2,M) containing
         the N 6-character names of the constants.  Each name
         will be padded to 8 characters with trailing spaces
         and stored in NAM(1,n) and NAM(2,n).  A suggested
         value for M (which must clearly be at least N) is
         300, adequate for the DE200/LE200 ephemeris.

   VAL   is an M-element double precision array containing the
         N values.

   SS    is a 6-element double precision array that will be
         filled with the contents of group 1030 (start and stop
         epochs, etc).

   N     is an integer giving the number of values read from
         the file.

                                - 6 -
SUN/87.4                                                        Page 7


Notes:

     1.  Because of file positioning, this routine should be called
         before any reference to XSTATE or READE.

     2.  XCONST's Fortran-66 origins mean that the names are stored as
         Hollerith data in integer variables, rather than as character
         strings.  See the Fortran source of the example program
         JPLCONST for details of how to WRITE such names, and the
         subroutine PLEPH for an example of searching for a particular
         named constant.




4  HOW TO READ AN EPHEMERIS FILE FROM THE JPL TAPE

Most users will not need to do this as the 1960-2000 portion of the
DE200/LE200 ephemeris is included in the Starlink Software Collection
on disc ready for interrogation by the subroutines.

The JPL tape contains two DE200/LE200 ephemerides with different time
spans.  The first one on the tape (the second file, following the
Fortran source) covers the range 1960 to 2000, and the second one (the
third file on the tape) covers 1800 to 2050.

To read one of these ephemerides onto disc, the READ66 program is
used.  This is how to produce the disc form of the 1960-2000
ephemeris:

     1.  $ ALLO tape FOR009 (where 'tape' is for example 'MTA0:')

     2.  Mount the Starlink copy of the JPL ephemeris tape on the
         drive

     3.  $ MOUNT/FOR/BLOCK=6656/REC=1664 FOR009

     4.  $ ASSIGN/USER file FOR012 (where 'file' is the name chosen
         for the ephemeris file)

     5.  $ SET MAG/SKIP=FILE:1 (FILE:2 would copy the 1800-2050
         ephemeris instead)

     6.  $ RUN JPLDIR:READ66

     7.  $ DISMOUNT FOR009

A number of messages will appear, ending with a Fortran STOP.  The
disc form of the ephemeris file is now available as the nominated
file.  The 1960-2000 ephemeris occupies some 6100 blocks.



                                - 7 -
SUN/87.4                                                        Page 8


5  HOW TO EXTRACT A SUBSET OF AN EPHEMERIS FILE ON DISC

Where a programme of work will require frequent access to ephemeris
information over a limited timespan, it will usually be best to
extract into a separate file the region required, to minimise access
time.  This is done with the program XSHORT.  For example, this is how
to copy the subset 1980-1983 inclusive:

     1.  $ ASSIGN/USER JPLDIR:DE200.DAT FOR009

     2.  $ ASSIGN/USER file FOR012 (where 'file' is the name chosen
         for the subset ephemeris file)

     3.  $ RUN JPLDIR:XSHORT

Messages will appear announcing the range of dates covered by the
input ephemeris file (FOR009), and prompting for the start and end
epoch.  It is necessary to enter the range as Julian day numbers (not
MJD - so the leading 24 is required), in the correct format for VAX
Fortran's NAMELIST facility.  Thus for 1980-83:

       <space>$IN EP=2444239,2445700
       <space>$END

Messages will appear which include confirmation of the dates entered,
terminated by a FORTRAN STOP.  The file nominated at step 2 has now
been created and can be accessed by the interrogation subroutines.



6  SOME NOTES ON THE JPL FORTRAN ROUTINES

The Fortran routines supplied on the JPL tape are supplied, as far as
possible, unchanged.  In some cases the routines have to be tailored
for VAX use, according to prescriptions supplied within the source; in
some instances extra changes were found to be necessary before the
software would run.  Where modifications have been necessary, the
style of the original has been preserved - no use of Fortran77
facilities has been made for example.

The Fortran source as originally supplied is available in file
JPLDIR:SOURCE.JPL.  All the Fortran - with modifications where
appropriate - is supplied in the text library SOURCE.TLB in the same
directory.  The subprograms are available in the object library
JPLDIR:JPL.OLB, and the utilities READ66 and XSHORT are ready to use
as JPLDIR:READ66.EXE and JPLDIR:XSHORT.EXE.

The subroutines use the following labelled COMMONS:





                                - 8 -

The DE200/LE200 ephemeris was produced jointly by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, the US Naval Observatory and the US Naval Surface Weapons
Center.  I would like to thank Catherine Hohenkerk of HM Nautical
Almanac Office at the Royal Greenwich Observatory for supplying a copy
of the JPL tape and documentation, and Dr E M Standish of JPL for
further advice on the use of the ephemeris, including the

                              APPENDIX A

             EXAMPLE PROGRAM TO INTERROGATE AN EPHEMERIS



The program JPLPLEPH (the Fortran source and the executable image are
in JPLDIR) demonstrates the use of the PLEPH routine.  Once compiled,
and linked with JPLDIR:JPL/L, it can be run as follows:

     1.  $ ASSIGN/USER JPLDIR:DE200.DAT FOR012

     2.  $ RUN JPLDIR:JPLPLEPH

JPLPLEPH calls the PLEPH subroutine (which in turn calls the XCONST
and XSTATE subroutines) to interpolate from the ephemeris file on
Fortran unit 12 the heliocentric position and velocity of the Earth
for the instant of dynamical time TDB = 2440000.5.  The output is as
follows:

 -0.4546344405877503     -0.8303581726592454     -0.3600779865854318

       EXAMPLE PROGRAM TO INTERROGATE AN EPHEMERIS USING XSTATE



The program JPLSTATE (both the Fortran source and the executable image
are in JPLDIR) demonstrates the use of the XSTATE routine.  Once
compiled, and linked with JPLDIR:JPL/L, it can be run as follows:

     1.  $ ASSIGN/USER JPLDIR:DE200.DAT FOR012

     2.  $ RUN JPLDIR:JPLSTATE

JPLSTATE calls the XSTATE subroutine to interpolate from the ephemeris
file on Fortran unit 12 the heliocentric position and velocity of the
Earth-Moon barycentre for the instant of dynamical time TDB =
2440000.5.  The output is as follows:

-0.4546052777834041     -0.8303445173918213     -0.3600715676773557

          0

(The final zero is the status returned.)

       EXAMPLE PROGRAM TO OBTAIN THE CONSTANTS OF AN EPHEMERIS



The program JPLCONST (both the Fortran source and the executable image
are in JPLDIR) demonstrates the use of the XCONST subroutine.  Once
compiled, and linked with JPLDIR:JPL/L, it can be run as follows:

     1.  $ ASSIGN/USER JPLDIR:DE200.DAT FOR012

     2.  $ RUN JPLDIR:JPLCONST

JPLCONST uses the XCONST subroutine to list all the constants of the
ephemeris on Fortran unit 12.  See also the Fortran source of the
PLEPH subroutine, which shows how the data output by XCONST can be
searched for named constants.
