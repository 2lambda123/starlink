\section{INTRODUCTION}

The Simple Software Tools package (SST) is a package of applications
designed to help with the production of software and documentation, with
particular emphasis on ADAM programming using Fortran~77. 

As its name suggests, SST is intended for performing fairly simple
manipulation of software, but it aims to tackle some of the
commonly encountered problems which are not catered for in more
sophisticated commercial software tools (such as FORCHECK and VAXset) which
are available on Starlink. 
In future, SST may also duplicate a few of the simpler facilities which
commercial products offer in order to avoid the cost (and generally much
higher overheads, such as disk space) which prevent the commercial products
being freely available on all Starlink machines. 

This document describes the first version of the SST package, whose main
initial purpose is to provide tools to extract information from subroutine
``prologues'' and to format this information in a variety of ways to produce
different forms of user documentation. 
A simple source-code and comment statistics tool is also included.


\section{GETTING STARTED}

All the applications in the SST package run under ADAM, so before you start
you should execute the command: 

\begin{verbatim}
   $ ADAMSTART
\end{verbatim}

This is a good opportunity to add this command to your LOGIN.COM file if you
have not already done so. 

The commands within the SST package itself can be used either from the ADAM
command language ICL, or from DCL. 
These commands are initially made available by typing `SST' at the command
prompt, {\em e.g.}\ from ICL: 

\begin{verbatim}
   $ ICL
   ICL> SST
\end{verbatim}

or from DCL:

\begin{verbatim}
   $ SST
\end{verbatim}

In either case, the following message will be displayed, indicating that the
package is ready for use: 

\begin{quote}
{\tt Simple Software Tools (SST) commands are now available.}
\end{quote}

You can then invoke any of the SST applications by typing the appropriate
command (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:descriptions} for a detailed description
of the applications available). 

When working from ICL you can obtain help about SST by using the HELP command,
thus: 

\begin{verbatim}
   ICL> HELP SST
\end{verbatim}

You can also obtain help on each individual application by giving its name,
{\em e.g:}

\begin{verbatim}
   ICL> HELP FORSTATS
\end{verbatim}

will give help on the SST application FORSTATS.
``In-line'' help on an application's parameters is also available, in the
normal ADAM way, by typing `?' or `??' in response to any prompt requesting a
value for a parameter.


\section{OVERVIEW OF SST APPLICATIONS}

\subsection{Producing \LaTeX\ Documentation (PROLAT)}

The SST application PROLAT is provided to facilitate the production of
documentation for packages of applications and subroutine libraries. 
It works by extracting the necessary information from ``prologues'' ({\em
i.e.}\ header comments) within the source-code files which comprise the
software, and formatting this information into a \LaTeX\ document. 
The documentation in Appendix~\ref{appendix:descriptions}, for example, has
been produced by this means. 

For PROLAT to work correctly, the prologue information must use the layout
generated by the extended Language Sensitive Editor STARLSE (SUN/105), with
which a number of the SST applications are designed to integrate. 
It is also possible to convert some older ADAM/SSE prologue layouts into the
required form automatically if required (see \S\ref{sect:procvt} for
details). 

To use PROLAT, you should supply a file containing prologue information in
the correct format as input, and the resulting output will then be a \LaTeX\
document describing the software in the input file (by default this is
assumed to be an ADAM application program, otherwise known as an A-task). 
The document will be written to a file (PROLAT.TEX by default) which can
then be processed directly with the LATEX command. 

For example, if an application with suitable prologue information resides in 
the file PROG.FOR, then the following sequence of commands would extract this 
information and send the derived document to a Canon laser printer:

\begin{verbatim}
   ICL> PROLAT PROG.FOR
   ICL> SPAWN LATEX PROLAT
   ICL> $DVICAN PROLAT
   ICL> $PRCN PROLAT.DVI-CAN
\end{verbatim}

When working from ICL, notice how `SPAWN' must be used in front of the LATEX
command.
This is to overcome problems with the way LATEX writes to the terminal, which
can cause ICL to ``hang'' if a \$LATEX command is issued directly. 
The last three commands are, of course, simply the standard processing
sequence for sending a \LaTeX\ source file to a Starlink laser printer (see
SUN/9, SUN/12 \& SUN/34 for further details of \LaTeX). 
The entire operation could also be performed from DCL directly.

As with most SST applications, a ``wild card'' input file may be specified
in order to combine a number of program descriptions into a single document.
Thus, the following command could be used to document an entire software
system if the necessary files resided in the current directory: 

\begin{verbatim}
   ICL> PROLAT *.FOR
\end{verbatim}

PROLAT has a number of options to tailor its behaviour.
For instance, you can specify that you are processing information about a
subroutine library (rather than application programs) so as to produce a
slightly different documentation format. 
You can also specify that you want only the descriptive part of the document
without any \LaTeX\ declarations.
This latter option is useful if you are adding the information to a larger
document which already contains all the necessary \LaTeX\ commands ({\em
e.g.}\ as an appendix, such as in the present document). 

Note that PROLAT does not attempt to provide a sophisticated text-processing
language and does not, therefore, exploit all the layout facilities which
\LaTeX\ has to offer. 
Instead, it is simply intended for achieving a close approximation to the
final form of a document as quickly and easily as possible. 
If you want to go further and use fancy \LaTeX\ fonts or an extravagant layout
in your final document, then you should be prepared to edit the output file
from PROLAT to achieve this. 
By adopting this approach, the prologue layout can be kept relatively
simple, so that it can function as the source for other types of
documentation (see below), as well as for possible future documentation
formats yet to be invented. 

\subsection{Producing Help Libraries (PROHLP)}

The SST application PROHLP functions in a rather similar way to PROLAT
(above), except that its output format is not \LaTeX, but a text file
designed for insertion into a help library. 
By using PROHLP you can therefore make program and subroutine documentation
available on-line, as well as simply on paper. 

The help file format produced by PROHLP is designed to integrate both with
the ADAM help system and also with the STARLSE editor. 
This means that it is easy to make prologue information available to the
person running a program, and also to make subroutine information available
to someone using STARLSE (see \S\ref{sect:propak} for details of the
latter). 
As before, the initial prologue information must be in the form generated by
STARLSE. 

To give an example, suppose you have an ADAM application program (an A-task)
in the file PROG.FOR, along with suitable prologue information, and you want
to make this information available in a help library so that it can be
accessed when the program is run. 
The first step would be to create the library (if you have not already done
so), as follows: 

\begin{verbatim}
   ICL> $LIBRARY/CREATE/HELP MYLIB.HLB
\end{verbatim}

The prologue information is then extracted using PROHLP which, by default,
writes it to the file PROHLP.HLP: 

\begin{verbatim}
   ICL> PROHLP PROG.FOR
\end{verbatim}

The extracted information can then be inserted into the library and the
intermediate help file deleted: 

\begin{verbatim}
   ICL> $LIBRARY/HELP MYLIB.HLB PROHLP.HLP
   ICL> $DELETE PROHLP.HLP;*
\end{verbatim}

You can check that the help library contains the correct information by using
the DCL command \$HELP with the /LIBRARY qualifier.

This help information can be made available to the application program via
the ADAM help system. 
To do this, the interface (.IFL) file for the application should contain
references to the appropriate entries in the help library. 
Thus, at the start of the interface file, before any parameter definitions,
there should be a line such as: 

\begin{verbatim}
   helplib 'MYDISK::[ME.PROGS]MYLIB'
\end{verbatim}

which identifies the help library to be used.
Note that a full directory specification is needed (or an equivalent logical
name). 
Each of the application's parameters for which help information is available
should also have a line in its interface file entry such as: 

\begin{verbatim}
   helpkey *
\end{verbatim}

where `$*$' specifies that a default set of keywords should be used to
access the parameter information in the help library. 
The library structure which results from using PROHLP is compatible with 
this set of defaults.


\subsection{Producing STARLSE Package Definitions (PROPAK)}
\label{sect:propak}

If you have developed a subroutine library using STARLSE, with prologue
information in the correct form, then the SST application PROPAK can be used
to generate an LSE {\em package definition} to facilitate future use of the
library from within the STARLSE editor. 
This package definition will define LSE templates for each of the routines
in the library.
It can then be used to make these templates available within the editor, in
the same way that the standard ADAM-subroutine templates are provided within
STARLSE. 

A package definition can be generated by providing the appropriate source
code files (containing prologue information) as input to PROPAK, for
instance: 

\begin{verbatim}
   ICL> PROPAK *.FOR PACK=XYZ
\end{verbatim}

Note that a value for the PACK parameter (the name of the package to be
produced) must also be given.
It will be prompted for if not supplied on the command line. 

By default, the output package definition is written to the file PROPAK.LSE,
which can then be used to extend your STARLSE editing environment. 
To do this, the file should be read into an editing buffer and the LSE
command `DO' executed to compile the definition. 
If you then move to a buffer with a file type of `.FOR' or `.GEN', the
routine templates you have just defined will become available for use. 
Note that LSE allows you to save an extended editing context for future use
so that you do not have to repeat this compilation process each time
(although the resulting files can be rather large). 
For details of how to do this the VAXset documentation for LSE should be
consulted. 

\paragraph{Accessing help libraries.}
An important feature of PROPAK is its ability to make a package definition
refer to a matching help library produced from the same source files using
PROHLP. 
To do so, the HELP parameter should be used with the PROPAK command to
specify the (full) name of the help library to which the package should
refer. 
Help library references will then be inserted into the package definition
and the associated help information will become available from within
STARLSE when the definition is compiled. 
(To access help on a particular routine, the cursor is placed on the routine
name in the editing buffer and the help key GOLD PF2 is used.) 

Note that the ATASK parameter should be set to FALSE when using PROHLP for
this purpose in order to obtain a help library suitable for a subroutine
library, rather than a package of applications programs. 


\subsection{Converting ``Old-Style'' ADAM/SSE Prologues (PROCVT)}
\label{sect:procvt}

A considerable amount of ADAM software already in existence uses an
``old-style'' prologue layout based on templates held in the ADAM\_PRO
directory. 
Since there has never been a fully satisfactory method of converting such
prologue information into documentation, it is doubtful whether many of
these older prologues are of a high enough quality to be used for this
purpose now. 
Nevertheless, in a spirit of optimism, the SST application PROCVT has been
provided to permit the conversion of these old-style prologues into the new
(STARLSE) form required by other SST applications. 
PROCVT can also be used as a useful first step in upgrading an old-style
prologue, even if the information it contains also needs attention before it
becomes suitable for documentation purposes. 

Normally, PROCVT will be used with both an input and an output file
specified, for instance: 

\begin{verbatim}
   ICL> PROCVT OLD.FOR NEW.FOR
\end{verbatim}

This command will convert the old-style prologue held in the file OLD.FOR
into STARLSE format and will write it (together with all the associated
source code) to the file NEW.FOR. 
Be careful not to use PROCVT on a file which already has a suitable prologue
layout -- you will not be pleased with the result! 

Note that perfect results cannot always be expected with PROCVT unless the
original old-style prologue template has been followed very carefully.
Consequently, it may sometimes be necessary to use STARLSE afterwards to
make fine adjustments before adequate documentation can be produced using
other SST commands. 
To facilitate this, PROCVT will insert appropriate STARLSE placeholders into
the output file wherever information is missing. 


\subsection{Producing Source-Code Statistics (FORSTATS)}

The SST application FORSTATS is provided as a ``quick look'' method of
inspecting large Fortran~77 software systems, with the aim of assessing the
volume of code present and its likely quality. 
These two factors (code volume and quality) are usually the most important
indicators of the amount of work needed to maintain, or change, an existing
software package, especially if you are not initially familiar with it. 

Counting lines of code is obviously a simple method of measuring software
volume, but the measurement of quality is more difficult and subjective. 
The approach used by FORSTATS depends on the observation that if corners are
cut during code development, then the first and most obvious sign (at least 
on Starlink) is usually the omission of in-code comments and prologue
information. 
Past experience with Starlink software has shown that there is an important
correlation between the ease of understanding and supporting a large
software package and the overall level of commenting which its original
author has provided. 

FORSTATS attempts to quantify this by producing a number of simple
statistics.
These are based on line and character counts derived from the code and
comments in each program unit of a Fortran~77 software system. 
It compares these statistics with a set of expected values, which have been
derived experimentally from existing Starlink software, and flags values
which lie outside the expected range. 

When developing software, FORSTATS can be used to highlight those areas
where more attention to in-code commentary would be useful to assist future
support programmers. 
Conversely, when inheriting an existing software package, FORSTATS can be
used as an aid to identifying possible problem areas before planning 
changes, {\em etc.}
In a large software system, it can also be invaluable simply for listing the
program units present and indicating their size. 

To run FORSTATS on a software system contained in a set of `.FOR' files, you
might use the command: 

\begin{verbatim}
   ICL> FORSTATS *.FOR
\end{verbatim}

This command will analyse the specified files and write a statistics file
(FORSTATS.LIS by default), which can then be printed. 
When it is first run, FORSTATS will append an explanatory key to the
statistics file to help you interpret its contents. 
You can suppress this key in future by specifying `NOKEY' on the command
line.
