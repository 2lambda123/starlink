These files are dumps of the Starlink database, as of 2005 June 8.
They were dumped as HTML from the database (it was either that or
a Postgres-specific format), and subsequently converted to CSV.  Each
of the files includes a line, with leading '##', giving the column
names.

The Starlink database is no longer maintained, so these files are of
historical interest only.

Not all tables are here, since some of them contained personal
details of users and the like.  All the relevant software tables
are here, however.
