;;; Generated autoloads from virtual.el

(autoload (quote edstar-virtual) "virtual" "\
Purpose:
   Define a new \"virtual function\" for emacs.

Synopsis:
   (edstar-virtual fun args &rest body)

Description:
   This macro allows the creation of virtual functions. These may be used just
   like normal functions (created using defun), except that their lisp
   implementation may later be locally overridden. (This differs from simply
   using defun a second time to re-define the function, since this would
   modify the function permanently, with global scope, and destroy the original
   definition.)

   With a virtual function, the original global definition remains in place
   when the function is overridden and only the local definition (stored in a
   suitable local variable) is changed. This allows the function to be adapted
   for more specialised purposes on, say, a per-buffer basis, without affecting
   its use elsewhere.

   The term \"virtual function\" is object-oriented terminology for a function
   whose interface may be inherited from a base class by a more specialised
   class, but whose implementation may be overridden to provide more
   specialised (and appropriate) behaviour for a particular type of data. The
   use in emacs is very similar and fulfils the same purpose, except that the
   context within which the function is overridden will normally be an editing
   buffer or a (let...) form.

   To override a virtual function, you must create a suitable local variable
   with the same name as the function and then use edstar-override.

Arguments:
   fun
      The name of the virtual function.
   args
      The argument list.
   body
      The body of the function.

Notes:
   - This macro is used exactly like defun and takes the same arguments (but
   see below for differences associated with loading).

   - If using autoloading, you must ensure that any use of edstar-virtual
   is loaded before the virtual function it defines is overridden. If this
   is not done, subsequent autoloading may cause the new definition to be
   over-written.

   - Note that ;;;###autoload can be used to perform autoloading of a virtual
   function, but will result in the function's complete implementation being
   copied into the \"loaddefs.el\" file (unlike defun, which only generates
   an instruction to load the necessary file). This means that \"loaddefs.el\"
   must be updated if the function is changed. The need to do this can be
   minimised, however, if the function's implementation is encapsulated in a
   second (autoloaded) function.

   use in file name completion). The returned alist contains file names without
   a directory prefix, without duplicates and in alphabetical order. Each file
   name is associated with the symbol t. Certain files are omitted from the
   alist if they are not suitable for editing (see \"File Exclusion\" for

File Exclusion:
   Certain files are excluded from the returned alist if they are considered
   unsuitable for editing. By default, all files with file type extensions
   of \".o\", \".a\", \".tar\" and \".Z\" are excluded. This choice may be
   overridden by defining the environment variable EDSTAR_IGNORE_FILES to be

(autoload (quote edstar-override) "override" "\
Purpose:
   Override a \"virtual function\".

Synopsis:
   (edstar-override fun args &rest body)

Description:
   This macro allows a virtual function created with edstar-virtual (q.v.) to
   be overridden by giving it a new implementation (the calling interface
   remains the same). 

   The usual way of using this macro is first to create a local version of a
   variable with the same name as the virtual function (either using let or
   make-local-variable) and then to provide a new local implementation of the
   function with edstar-override. The new implementation will then be in effect
   wherever the local variable is within scope, while the previous
   implementation will remain in effect elsewhere.

   Normally, you do not want the original global implementation of a virtual
   function to be affected by edstar-override. However, if you do not create a
   appropriate local variable first, you will be modifying whatever version of
   the variable is within scope at that point. If this is the global version,
   then the original implementation will be destroyed. This is a legitimate
   use of edstar-override.

Arguments:
   fun
      The name of the virtual function to be overridden.
   args
      The argument list. This should match the argument list given in the
      original invocation of edstar-virtual.
   body
      The body of the function. Any documentation string or \"(interactive)\"
      declaration is ignored, since the user-interface is defined by the
      original use of edstar-virtual and is not changed by edstar-override.

Notes:
   - This macro is used like defun and takes the same arguments.

   - You should not normally autoload an invocation of this macro, since its
   purpose is to override a virtual function (normally itself autoloaded) only
   at an appropriate point during execution. Normally, edstar-override will
   be invoked from the body of another function.

;;; Generated autoloads from make_virtual.el

(autoload (quote edstar-make-virtual) "make_virtual" "\
Purpose:
   Turn a function into a \"virtual\" function.

Synopsis:
   (edstar-make-virtual fun args &optional doc interactive)

Description:
   This macro allows the creation of a virtual function (c.f. edstar-virtual)
   from an existing normal (non-virtual) function. The starting function may
   have been created using defun, or may be a built-in emacs function.

   Once a function has been converted into a virtual function, its
   implementation may be locally overridden using edstar-override (q.v.).

Arguments:
   fun
      The name of the function which is to be made virtual.
   args
      The argument list. This must match the argumant list of the original
      function.
   doc
      An optional documentation string. If supplied, it will override the
      function's original documentation string, if any.
   interactive
      An optional \"(interactive)\" declaration. If supplied, it will override
      the function's original declaration, if any. It may often be necessary
      to supply this declaration because it may not be possible to obtain the
      original one from the function supplied (e.g. if it is not a lisp
      function). If the function is interactively-callable, but no
      \"(interactive)\" declaration can be obtained, then a default one is
      used, although this may not always be appropriate.

Notes:
   - If using autoloading, you must ensure that the function being made
   virtual is loaded before using this macro. If this is not done, subsequent
   autoloading may cause the new definition to be over-written.

Purpose:
   Look up a keyword in a table.

Description:
   Given a string containing the name (or an abbreviation) for a keyword
   (e.g. a token or helpkey) which is to be expanded, this function validates
   the name by looking it up in a keyword table. If found, it returns a symbol
   which contains the keyword information.

Arguments:
   name
      A string containing the keyword name, or an abbreviation (case
      insensitive). Abbreviations need not be unique; if necessary, a menu
      will be presented to the user to resolve any ambiguity.
   table
      An optional keyword table in which to find the name. If not given,
      edstar-token-table is used by default.

Returned Value:
   If the keyword name is valid, this function returns the symbol (interned
   in the table) which contains the keyword expansion information. Otherwise
   it returns nil.

Notes:
   If user interaction is necessary, then the user will have the option of
   aborting the keyword look-up. If this occurs, a value of nil will be
   returned, even though the keyword abbreviation was valid.

Purpose:
   Define a keyboard macro (learn sequence).

Description:
   The function records a sequence of key presses and/or commands (a keyboard
   macro) and binds them to a key, so that they may be re-invoked by pressing
   that key. The sequence of events in defining a macro is as follows:

   1) Unless you specify a key when you invoke the \"learn\" function (you
   will not normally do so), you are first prompted to press the key which
   will be used to invoke the macro. Choose any key, or key sequence (using
   the GOLD- key for example), that you do not subsequently want to use for
   its original purpose.

   2) You should then press the keys and/or enter the commands which you
   want invoked. These will be executed as you enter them, so you can see
   their effect.

   3) When your definition is complete, press the original key (the one
   you pressed in step 1). This will terminate the learn sequence and cause
   this key to invoke the macro you have defined when you next press it.

      Name of the file to be found, as a string.

Notes:
   -  If \"\" or \".\" appear in the search path, they are interpreted as the
      current default directory, as given in edstar-default-directory.
   -  If \"..\" appears in the search path, it is interpreted as the parent
      directory of edstar-default-directory.
   -  Environment variable substitution and use of \"~\" in the file name are
      both supported.

   Determine how a line should be broken at the current position.

Description:
   The function returns a symbol indicating the context of the current editing
   position (point), indicating how the current line should be broken at that
   point so as to create a new line. It returns one of the following symbols:

     line-comment --> Point is in a full-line comment line.
     eol-comment  --> Point is inside an end-of-line (!) comment.
     code         --> Point is at the start or end of a line of code.
     continuation --> Point is inside a line of code, which must be continued.
     string       --> Point is inside a quoted string within a line of code.

Bugs:
   This function takes no account of code lines which are continued, so quoted
   strings should not be split across continuation lines.

(autoload (quote starfort-break-line) "comment2" "\

Purpose:
   Break a line of Fortran at the current editing position.

Description:
   The function breaks a line of Fortran at the current editing position
   (point) to create a new line. If inside a comment line, a line of code or
   a quoted string (within code), then it is appropriately continued and
   indented on the new line.

Bugs:
   Full-line comment lines are not correctly indented when they are broken
   by this routine. More work needed here.

(autoload (quote edstar-insert-comment-line) "comment1" "\

Purpose:
   Insert a comment about the current line.

Description:
   The function inserts a new full comment line (containing a comment
   placeholder) in front of the current line and moves the editing position
   (point) on to the placeholder, ready to enter a new comment.

Notes:
   -  This command takes no action if the current line is already a full
      comment line.
   -  If the previous line is not already blank, a blank line will be inserted
      in front of the new comment line, to separate it from previous text.

;;; Generated autoloads from choose_f.el

(autoload (quote edstar-choose-from-menu) "choose_f" "\

Purpose:
   Allow the user to choose an option from a menu.

Description:
   The functon displays a menu in a new window and allows the user to select
   an item from it. The user also has the option of aborting (i.e. not making
   a selection). The window is removed once the selection has been made.

Arguments:
   menu
      A list of strings, each of which will appear on its own line as a
      separate menu item.

Returned Value:
   An integer giving the index of the selected item in the menu list supplied
   (the first one is number 0).

Notes:
   If the user chooses to abort (i.e. not to make a selection), then nil is
   returned.

Global Variables:
   oldpos
      This is shared with the function edstar-handle-menu-motion and records
      the previous position of the selection cursor in the menu buffer.

(autoload (quote starfort-line-break-context) "break" "\

Purpose:
   Determine how a line should be broken at the current position.

Description:
   The function returns a symbol indicating the context of the current editing
   position (point), indicating how the current line should be broken at that
   point so as to create a new line. It returns one of the following symbols:

     line-comment --> Point is in a full-line comment line.
     eol-comment  --> Point is inside an end-of-line (!) comment.

     continuation --> Point is inside a line of code, which must be continued.
     string       --> Point is inside a quoted string within a line of code.

Bugs:

   strings should not be split across continuation lines.

(autoload (quote starfort-backup-to-break) "break" "\

Purpose:
   Search backwards for a possible line break position.

Description:
   The function moves the current editing position (point) backwards on the
   current line until it locates a position which may be suitable for
   breaking the line. It returns the value of starfort-line-break-context
   at the resulting position.

Notes:
  -  The function searches backwards for a space which ends a word, or (if
  this would place it inside a quoted string) for the first character of a
  quoted word. If it cannot find a suitable position, point remains unchanged.
  -  This function should always leave point somewhere on the current line.
  -  This is a lower level routine and the position found must be further
  validated before use (e.g. by starfort-line-break-point) to protect against
  the possible creation of zero-length strings and to ensure that the required
  line length is not exceeded.

(autoload (quote starfort-line-break-point) "break" "\

Purpose:
   Find the best line break point on the current line.

Description:
   The function moves point to the best possible position for breaking the
   current line so as to produce a new line. It attempts to break at white
   space if possible and to make the resulting broken line as long as possible
   while not extending past fill-column. It returns the value of the function
   starfort-line-break-context at the chosen position.

(autoload (quote starfort-break-line) "break" "\

Purpose:
   Break a line of Fortran at the current editing position.

Description:
   The function breaks a line of Fortran at the current editing position
   (point) to create a new line. If inside a comment line, a line of code or
   a quoted string (within code), then it is appropriately continued and
   indented on the new line.

Arguments:
   context
      The value of the function starfort-line-break-context at the point
      where the line is to be broken. This indicates what type of break
      (and continuation) is required.

Bugs:
   Full-line comment lines are not correctly indented when they are broken
   by this routine. More work needed here.

(autoload (quote starfort-do-auto-fill) "break" "\

Purpose:
   Perform auto-fill on Fortran lines.

Description:
   This function is intended for use by the auto-fill-hook in Starfort mode
   to perform automatic breaking of Fortran lines whenever a space character
   is entered beyond the fill-column (normally 71 in Starfort mode). It
   handles breaking of comment and code lines, including quoted strings,
   producing an appropriately indented continuation line.
" nil nil)

(autoload (quote starfort-newline) "break" "\

Purpose:
   Break the current line to create a new line.

Description:
   The function breaks a line of Fortran into two so as to create a new line.
   Comment lines, lines of code and quoted strings (within code) are
   appropriately continued and indented on the new line. If the editing
   position (point) is not initially beyond the buffer's fill column, the line
   is broken at the editing position. Otherwise, it is broken at the most
   suitable point which does not leave the first portion of the line extending
   beyond the fill column.

Notes:
   Placeholders will not be split by this function, even if the editing
   position lies within one.

Purpose:

Description:
   The function returns non-nil if the string passed as an argument is an
   absolute file name, in the sense that it should not be searched for using
   any directory path. This will be the case if it contains a \"/\" character
   anywhere within it. (Note that relative file names containing \"/\" are
   considered \"absolute\" by this function.)
