(defun edstar-possible-files (prefix)
"
Purpose:
   Return an alist of all files accessible via EDSTAR_PATH.

Description:
   The function returns an alist of the names of all files which are currently
   accessible in directories on the EDSTAR_PATH search path (it is intended for
   use in file name completion). The returned alist contains file names without
   a directory prefix, without duplicates and in alphabetical order. Each file
   name is associated with the symbol t. Certain files are omitted from the
   alist if they are not suitable for editing (see \"File Exclusion\" for
   details).

Arguments:
   prefix
      If this string argument is non-nil, only those file names which start
      with this prefix will be considered (if not otherwise excluded).
      Otherwise, all file names not beginning with \".\" will be considered.

File Exclusion:
   Certain files are excluded from the returned alist if they are considered
   unsuitable for editing. By default, all files with file type extensions
   of \".o\", \".a\", \".tar\" and \".Z\" are excluded. This choice may be
   overridden by defining the environment variable EDSTAR_IGNORE_FILES to be
   a regular expression which matches the file type extension (excluding the
   \".\") of any files to be excluded. Files whose names begin with \".\" are
   always excluded.
