Purpose:
   Reserve a file from the (sccs) repository.

Description:
   The function reserves a file from the (sccs) repository and reads it into
   a buffer for editing. The command \"sccs edit\" is used for reserving the
   file, unless an alternative command has been specified via tha EDSTAR_RES
   environment variable.

   If a buffer of the same name was previously in use it is over-written, but
   the editing position (point) is preserved.

Arguments:
   file (optional)
      A string giving the name of the file to be reserved (without any
      directory prefix). The file should exist in the SCCS repository and
      should not already be reserved. If this argument is not given, it is
      prompted for. The default is to use the name of the file being visited
      by the current buffer.

Description:
