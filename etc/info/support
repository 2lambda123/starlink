Date: 20th June, 2004

================================================================================
This is a brief list of Unix Starlink Software items and their level of
support.  Note that some items are NOT supported by Starlink.  Note
also that the intrinsic importance of an item of software is not
directly related to support level.  Some important software is supported
outside Starlink; some relatively unimportant software happens to have
good support (because the author is accessible).
