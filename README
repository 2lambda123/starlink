To build the starlink classic applications the following steps are required:

 - Specify where you want the installed files to end up (_PREFIX)
   and where you want the build to find previously installed files (_STARLINK)
   (defaults to /star)

      % unsetenv STARLINK
      % setenv STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK /export3/sun
      % setenv STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX   /export3/sun

 - First build the thirdparty applications and buildsupport system.
   Some of these applications have been patched specifically for
   building Starlink applications so the default versions shipped with
   the OS may not work.

      % ./bootstrap

 - Now configure and build the core libraries (running the configure
   from this directory forces things to build in the correct order)

      % ./configure -C   # -C means caching results

 - Now you can go into a specific directory and build the library/application
   as normal (a bootstrap is required if building from CVS)

      % ./bootsrap
      % ./configure -C
      % make
      % make install-manifest
