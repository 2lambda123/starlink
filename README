     Starlink support applications required to build configure-based
     Starlink applications.

  docs
     General documentation not associated with a particular application
     or library.


To build the starlink classic applications the following steps are required:

 - Specify where you want the installed files to end up (_PREFIX)
   and where you want the build to find previously installed files (_STARLINK)
   (defaults to /star)

      % unsetenv STARLINK
      % setenv STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK /export3/sun
      % setenv STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX   /export3/sun

 - First build the thirdparty applications and buildsupport system.
   Some of these applications have been patched specifically for
   building Starlink applications so the default versions shipped with
   the OS may not work.

      % ./bootstrap

   These will be installed into $STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX/buildsupport
   so you should add $STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX/buildsupport/bin to your
   path at this point.

 - Now configure and build the core libraries (running the configure
   from this directory forces things to build in the correct order)

      % ./configure -C   # -C means caching results
      % make

 - Now you can go into a specific directory and build the library/application
   as normal (a bootstrap is required if building from CVS)

      % ./bootstrap
      % ./configure -C
      % make
      % make install-manifest

See SSN/78 (in docs/ssn78) for more details on building Starlink classic
applications.
