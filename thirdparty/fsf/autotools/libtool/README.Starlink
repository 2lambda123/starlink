This is libtool 2.4.2, without any patches.

The "libtool" directory contains the vendor source. It should be updated as
appropriate and files regenerated with an unmodified autoconf/automake (as
same version as from the original distribution) as there are no Starlink
configuration requirements, they should only be found in this directory. The
intention is to keep patches against vendor as simple as possible.
