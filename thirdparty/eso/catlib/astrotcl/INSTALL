HOW TO INSTALL the Astrotcl Package
-----------------------------------


1. Before you build the ASTROTCL Package
----------------------------------------

The Astrotcl package assumes one of the following Tcl environments are
installed:

One of the following Tcl environments should be installed:

For Tcl7.6:
	itcl2.2    - [Incr Tcl], includes tcl7.6, tk4.2
	BLT2.1     - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX7.6.0  - Extended Tcl

Or for Tcl8.0 (TclPro-1.2):
	Tcl8.0.5   - Tcl Shell  (*** NOTE: bug in init.tcl, see below)
	Tk8.0.5    - Tk Toolkit
	itcl3.0.1  - [Incr Tcl]
	BLT2.4g    - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX8.0.4  - Extended Tcl

Or for Tcl8.2 (TclPro-1.3):
	Tcl8.2.3   - Tcl Shell
	Tk8.2.3    - Tk Toolkit
	itcl3.1.0  - [Incr Tcl]
	BLT2.4o    - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX8.2.0  - Extended Tcl (*** NOTE: see below for possible problems)

Or for Tcl8.3 (TclPro-1.4):
	Tcl8.3.3   - Tcl Shell
	Tk8.3.3    - Tk Toolkit
	itcl3.2    - [Incr Tcl]
	BLT2.4u    - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX8.3    - Extended Tcl

These packages are available from the TCL archives: 
  http://www.scriptics.com/

You can install the standard Tcl/Tk packages anywhere, however it is
easiest to install them all in the same directory (using the same
-prefix argument to configure).

You can also get a copy of the whole source tree from 
ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/archive/skycat/README.html.

Astrotcl also depends on the following package:

	Tclutil - Tcl and C++ Utilities Package

which is available from the same location as this package: 

	ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/archive/skycat/README.html

It is best to place both package sources under the same directory and
install them in the same target directory.


2. Build the ASTROTCL Package
-----------------------------

To make the ASTROTCL package, configure and make as follows:

	configure
	make
	make install

The default install dir is /usr/local. You can specify the -prefix
argument to configure to change this:

 	configure -prefix $INSTALLDIR

Note that the Astrotcl configure script reads configure information
produced by the Tclutil configure script. If you want to set different
configuration options, for example, to use a different compiler or to
enable or disable shared libraries, reconfigure the Tclutil package
first and then this package.

VLT Make Procedure
------------------

As an alternative to running configure and make, you can also do this:

	cd src
	make 
	make install

The Makefile in the $ASTROTCL/src directory runs configure and then make as
described above. You can also specify options to that Makefile, for
example:

	cd src
	make PREFIX=$INSTALLDIR

The PREFIX variable defaults to /usr/local and is the prefix of the
directory in which to install the software.

3. Start the demo application
-----------------------------
To run the demo, type:

	INSTALLDIR/lib/astrotcl/demos/astrotcl

This package does not currently include any applications, so this just
starts astrotcl_wish with the correct environment. 

4. If you are using shared libraries
------------------------------------
The Astrotcl shared library libastrotcl.sl (in HPs) or libastrotcl.so
(on Suns) is built with the same options used to build the Tclutil and
Tcl shared libraries. The options are read from the file
tclutilConfig.sh, which is produced the Tclutil configure script.

You may need to modify the SHLIB_PATH (HP) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Sun)
environment variable so that the necessary shared libraries are found
at run time.  Both variables have the same format: a colon ":"
separated list of directories to search for shared libraries.

From a tcl script you can load the ASTROTCL library dynamically with
the command "load <path>/libastrotcl.sl" or "load <path>/libastrotcl.so"
or it can be loaded automatically as a package. See the Tcl man pages
for more information.
