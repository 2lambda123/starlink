This directory contains the means of building the perl modules required
to run Starlink perl software such as ORAC-DR.

Run build-modules.sh and it will install CPANMINUS, retrieve required
CPAN modules and then build Starlink modules.

If new CPAN dependencies are required update the contents of the
file cpan.deps. The file perlmods-order.txt contains the order which
should be used to build the local Starlink modules.

Starlink modules are attached to the main repository as git submodules.
More modules can be added by issuing the command

  git submodule add ../perl-XXX.git thirdparty/perlsys/perlmods/perl-XXX

assuming that perl-XXX.git is in the same location as the main Starlink
repository. We currently prefer to install other modules from CPAN as
CPAN modules although it would be easy to add additional github repositories
as submodules.
