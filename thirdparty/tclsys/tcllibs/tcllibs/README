These directories contains various thirdparty Tcl libraries used mainly by
GAIA for its webservices. They are in an installed condition, so they can be
just recursively copied into a suitable tree. They have had all of their
non-Tcl parts removed, so are pure Tcl. This is all intentional to keep things
simple. If you want to update a package find the original sources, install it
and then import those into the tree (remembering to keep the local patches up
to date, see below).

The documentation is minimal consisting of the licensing and READMEs etc. 
Full documentation should be located in the support web sites (which are
mentioned in the documentation).

Local Patches:
--------------

   tcllibs/tclhttpd3.5.1/httpd.tcl:

      The bgerror proc was renamed to avoid overridding the global version.
      Clearly if you want to run httpd in some standalone mode you'll need
      to create a bgerror proc in your application.

   tcllibs/tclsoap1.6.8/SOAP-domain.tcl

      Modified because the XML-RPC behaviour was violating the
      XML-RPC spec (http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec).  It was giving an HTTP
      response code of 500 (error) with a correctly-formed XML-RPC fault
      packet, when it should have been giving a 200 (OK) response code.
