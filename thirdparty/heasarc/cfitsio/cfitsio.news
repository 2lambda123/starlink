 CFITSIO provides a C interface for reading and writing FITS files and 
 conforms to the Y2K FITS standards.  There is also a FORTRAN `wrapper'
 interface for calling the library from Fortran.  
 
 SUN/227 gives a brief introduction to CFITSIO - a hypertext version is
 available (`showme sun227' or `findme cfitsio').   There are also two
 User's Guides for C and Fortran Programmers which have been added to
 the Starlink Miscellaneous User Documents series as MUD/166 and MUD/167.

 Starlink is grateful to the maintainer of CFITSIO, Dr William Pence of 
 HEASARC at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center for permission to release 
 CFITSIO with the Starlink software.
