  <description>NCAR - Graphics Utilities</description>
  <abstract><p>The National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder,
Colorado has, for many years, distributed a extensive suite of high level
graphics utilities.  When NCAR converted these utilities to run over the ISO
standard GKS, Starlink was used as a test site.  Starlink was subsequently
given permission to release the NCAR utilities as part of the Starlink Software
Collection.  The NCAR utilities offer an alternative high level graphics
package to PGPLOT (SUN/15) for use within Starlink applications.  The NCAR
package is arguably more powerful than PGPLOT in functionality and flexibility,
but it does require a little more time to master.  Starlink provides a set of
extensions to the NCAR graphics utilities, SNX (SUN/90), to make the use of
NCAR more accessible to the beginner.  For lower level work, SGS (SUN/85) or
GKS (SUN/83) should be used.</p></abstract>
