  V1.3-2:

  Routines from SNX that replace NCAR calls or access the NCAR common
  blocks have been moved into the NCAR package. This is for various
  technical reasons. The linker scripts have been changed, if you
  want to link against the SNX variant of NCAR you need to supply
  the -snx flag. Note that snx_link and snx_link_adam do this
  automatically so this change should be hidden.

  This is NCAR v1.3-1,  a maintenance release which provides a hypertext
  version of SUN/88 (`showme sun88' or `findme ncar').

  There are no code changes.
