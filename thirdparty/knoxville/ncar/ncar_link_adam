#  History:
#      08-MAR-2007 (TIMJ):
#         Add -star option
#      19-MAR-2007 (PWD):
#         Add option to include replacement (SNX) routines so that 
#         their dependencies are resolved in a second pass.
#      08-MAY-2008 (PWD):
#         Introduce local SNX routines to avoid common block access
#         issues in shareable libraries. Also make replacement routines
#         local to simplify the above.
