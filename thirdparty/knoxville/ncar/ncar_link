#  Name:
#     ncar_link

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking NCAR library.

#  Language:
#     Bourne Shell

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked when linking against the NCAR library.
#     Use the -star option when linking with SNX and pass in the replacement
#     SNX routines as the second argument (-lsnx_ncar usually).

#  History:

#         Add -star option
#      19-MAR-2007 (PWD):
#         Add option to include replacement (SNX) routines so that 
#         their dependencies are resolved in a second pass.
