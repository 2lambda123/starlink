EXTRACTOR is a program for automatically detecting objects on an
astronomical image and building a catalogue of their properties. It is
particularly suited for the reduction of large scale galaxy-survey
data, but also performs well on other astronomical images.

EXTRACTOR is a development of Emmanuel Bertin's SExtractor
(Source-Extractor) program repackaged for use in the Starlink Software
Environment.  This means that it uses the Starlink parameter system,
accepts images in NDF format and uses the AST library for astrometry.

EXTRACTOR is described in SUN/226.
