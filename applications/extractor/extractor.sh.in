#  ===================================================================
#
#  Here look to see if there is an ADAM_USER directory.  If there is not
#  check whether or not there is an adam file that is not a directory.
#  If there is, issue a warning and exit.  Otherwise create the required
#  directory.

#  Locate the installed binaries, scripts etc.

export EXTRACTOR_CONFIG=$EXTRACTOR_DIR/config

#
#  Define symbols for the applications and scripts.
#  ===============================================

# eg:  alias command ${EXTRACTOR_BIN}/command
extract () { $EXTRACTOR_DIR/extractor; }
extractor () { $EXTRACTOR_DIR/extractor; }

#
#  Now do the same with alternative names.
#  ======================================

# eg:  alias extractor_command ${EXTRACTOR_DIR}/command

#
#  Tell the user that EXTRACTOR commands are now available.
#  =======================================================
