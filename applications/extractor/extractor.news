1 Update to EXTRACTOR
  
  A minor update to EXTRACTOR.

     - The range of output WCS coordinates should now always be 
       correctly normalised (i.e. RA's in range 0-24hrs).

     - Apertures should now be visible in the "APERTURES" checkimage.


 EXTRACTOR is described in SUN/226, which can be viewed on-line by the
 command:

    % showme sun226
