1 Update to EXTRACTOR

 A minor bug fix release. EXTRACTOR could crash on Tru64 UNIX
 if the measurement image contained BAD values that the 
 detection image did not.

 The output format for the X_WORLD and Y_WORLD fields has been 
 changed to always give at least 0.01 arcsecond accuracy.

 EXTRACTOR is described in SUN/226, which can be viewed on-line by the
 command:

    % showme sun226
