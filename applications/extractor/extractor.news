1 Update to EXTRACTOR

 This is a minor release of EXTRACTOR to fix a problem writing out 
 RA and Dec values (this effected EXTRACTOR only, not SExtractor).

 Recent changes to EXTRACTOR include an update of SExtractor to
 version 2.2.2 and the change of its license terms to GPL.

 EXTRACTOR is described in SUN/226, which can be viewed on-line by the
 command:
