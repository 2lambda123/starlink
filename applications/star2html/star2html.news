1 Star2HTML_update

 Star2HTML, the Starlink internal document hypertext support package,
 has been updated so that all document cross references now point at
 the RAL central service. You will need to run the hypertext linker
 hlink to restore the old behaviour of pointing at local documents
 (if any are available).
