  <description>Convert Starlink documents to hypertext</description>
  <abstract><p>Star2HTML lets you write (or convert) a Starlink document
      so that you can create two versions of it from a single source file.
      A paper version is produced by LaTeX, and a hypertext version
      (suitable for browsing on the web) is produced by latex2html.
      You can tailor each version to its own medium by marking selected text as
      LaTeX-only or HTML-only.</p>
    <p>Star2HTML also includes a set of document templates for producing
      Starlink documents in a standard style (such as `Starlink User
      Note').  They also define new LaTeX commands for adding extra
      links to the hypertext version of your document (without
      affecting the paper version). </p></abstract>
