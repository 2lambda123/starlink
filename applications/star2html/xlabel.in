#  Name:
#     xlabel

#  Purpose:
#     Adds \xlabel commands to a LaTeX document.

#  Type of Module:
#     Perl script

#  Description:
#     xlabel will modify a Latex
#     document by adding \xlabel commands to each section and subsection 
#     heading. This makes the heading usable as a target for a \xref 
#     cross-reference from another hypertext document.
#
#     The label names generated are produced from the LaTeX section heading
#     by removing common font changing commands or emphasis such as \tt,
#     \texttt, \ttfamily, \em and \emph, then folding to lower case, turning
#     spaces into underscores, and eliminating non-alphanumeric characters. 
#     If the generated name matches an existing xlabel name for the same 
#     section, it is not repeated.
#
#     You may need to edit the resulting file a little for specific cases.
#     The inserted names are displayed to assist in spotting peculiarities,
#     and warnings are issued if there are duplicated names or if the
#     generated name does not match an existing name for the same section.
#     See also Notes below.

#  Invocation:
#     xlabel document

#  Parameters:
#      document
#         The name of the document to be processed.

#  Examples:

#  Notes:
#     Possible problems with the automatically generated \xlabels are:
#     1. Duplicated names. Note that name clashes with automatically 
#        generated \xlabels, such as those produced by the SST macros,
#        will not be reported by xlabel.
#     2. Null or gibberish names because of LaTeX commands included in 
#        the heading, or removal of non-alphanumeric characters.
#     3. Possible need for xlabels on subsubsection etc. in addition to
#        those on sections and subsections.
