*  Name:
*     scb_locase

*  Purpose:
*     Test text for SCB C parsing.

*  Type:
*     C program.

*  Description:
*     This file is a test text for the SCB tagging routines.
*     It contains function calls, includes and function definitions.

*  Notes:
*     Note that it is never necessary to build this test package; the
*     presence of the source code as files which are syntactically correct 
*     and (in some sense) representative of files found elsewhere in the
*     Starlink source code collection is all that is required.

*  Arguments:
*     None.

*  Authors:
*     MBT: Mark Taylor (IoA)
