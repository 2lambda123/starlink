#  Name:
#     mk
#
#  Version:
#     Application, Mk V
#
#  Purpose:
#     Invoke make to build and install the SCB package.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.
#
#  Description:
#     This script should normally be used to invoke the make utility
#     to build and install the SCB package and to perform other
#     housekeeping tasks.  It invokes the make utility after first
#     defining appropriate environment variables and macros for the
#     computer system in use.  This file also serves to document the
#     systems on which SCB is implemented.
#
#  Invocation:
#     The user of this script should normally first define the SYSTEM
#     environment variable to identify the host computer system (see
#     the "Supported Systems" section).  This script should then be used
#     in the same way as the make utility would be used.  For instance,
#     to build, install and test SCB you might use the following
#     commands:
#
#        ./mk build
#        ./mk install
#        ./mk test
#        ./mk clean
#
#  Supported Systems:
#     The following systems are currently supported and may be
#     identified by defining the SYSTEM environment variable
#     appropriately before invoking this script:
#
#        alpha_OSF1
#           DEC Alpha machines running OSF1
#
#        ix86_Linux
#           Intel PC machines running Linux
#
#        sun4_Solaris
#           SUN Sparcstations running SunOS 5.x (Solaris)
#
#     In addition, the following systems may have been supported at some
#     time in the past.  This script contains the macro definitions 
#     needed for these systems, but it is not known whether SCB
#     will still build or run on these systems:
#
#        mips
#           DECstations running Ultrix
#
#        sun4
#           SUN Sparcstations running SunOS 4.x
#
#     This script will exit without action if the SYSTEM environment
#     variable is not defined.  A warning will be issued if it is
#     defined but is not set to one of the values above.  In this case,
#     no additional environment variables will be defined by this
#     script (any that are pre-defined will be passed on to make
#     unaltered).
#
#  Targets:
#     For details of what targets are provided, see the associated
#     makefile.  The latter will normally provide a default target
#     called "help", which outputs a message describing this script
#     and lists the targets provided.
#
#  Notes on Porting:
#     If your machine or system setup does not appear in this script,
#     then it should be possible to build and install SCB by
#     adding a new case to this script with appropriate definitions
#     (probably based on one of the existing implementations).
#
#  make Macros:
#     The following "global" make macros are used in the associated
#     makefile and may be changed by means of appropriate environment
#     variable definitions (in each case the default is shown in
#     parentheses).  Note that these macros are provided to allow
#     external control over the directories in which software is
#     installed, etc., so they should not normally be re-defined within
#     this script.
#
#        STARLINK (/star)
#           Pathname of the root directory beneath which Starlink
#           software is currently installed.  This indicates to
#           SCB where to find other Starlink software (include
#           files, libraries, etc.) which it uses.
#
#        INSTALL ($HOME)
#           Pathname of the root directory beneath which SCB will
#           be installed for use.  Your home directory will be used by
#           default.  This macro is provided to allow SCB to be
#           installed locally for personal use (e.g. during development
#           or testing).  It should be set to the $STARLINK directory if
#           you want to add SCB into an already installed set of
#           Starlink software.  You should ensure that the appropriate
#           sub-directories appear on any relevant search paths which
#           your system uses for locating software (e.g. binaries and
#           libraries).
#
#        EXPORT (.)
#           Pathname of the directory into which compressed tar files
#           will be written if the "export" or "export_source" make
#           targets are used to produce an exportable copy of SCB
#           or its source files.  The current working directory (i.e.
#           the SCB source directory) will be used by default.
#
#     The following "local" make macros are used in the associated
#     makefile and affect how the built package will interact with
#     the host system.  These may freely be changed.  In each case 
#     the default is shown in parentheses.
#
#        PERL5 (/usr/local/bin/perl)
#           Location of the Perl 5 binary.
#
#        PERL_MOD_DIR ($STARLINK/lib/perl5)
#           Directory for installation of Perl modules.
#
#        SOURCES_DIR ($STARLINK/sources)
#           Directory in which all source files to be indexed are held.
#           This directory should contain the source files for all the 
#           packages to be indexed, with each package 'pkg' contained 
#           either in a directory called 'pkg' or a tar archive called
#           'pkg.tar', 'pkg.tar.Z' or 'pkg.tar.gz'.
#
#        INDEX_DIR ($STARLINK/etc/scb)
#           Directory holding the index files generated by the source
#           code indexing program, and interrogated by the source code
#           browsing program.
# 
#        HTXSERVER_URL (http://star-www.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/)
#           URL of HTTP server which serves HTX versions of Starlink
#           documents.  Appending, e.g. 'sun1.htx/sun1.html' should 
#           be a reference to the top level of the HTML version of 
#           the Starlink document so named.
#
#        MIMETYPES_FILE (/etc/mime.types)
#           This should give the location of a MIME type mapping file.  
#           However, not much functionality is lost if the file named
#           by this variable does not exist.
#
#     The following "local" make macros are used in the associated
#     makefile and should normally be overridden by environment variable
#     definitions within this script.  All the local macros that are
#     used in building a package should overridden even when the value
#     is the same as the default.  This documents which macros are used
#     and ensures that the package will continue to build correctly even
#     if the default values are changed.  Macros that are not used on a
#     particular machine (e.g. RANLIB on Sparc Solaris 2) should not be
#     overridden.  In each case the default is shown in parentheses.
#
#        AR_IN (ar -r)
#           The command to use to insert an object (.o) file into an
#           archive (.a) library.  On some systems the variation 'ar r'
#           may be required instead.
#
#        CC (c89)
#           The C compiler command to use.
#
#        CFLAGS (-O)
#           The C compiler options to use.
#
#        FC (fort77)
#           The Fortran compiler command to use.  SCB requires a Fortran
#           77 compiler that supports the common "permitted" Starlink
#           extensions, as documented in Starlink General Paper SGP/16.
#           (These include only the most common extensions, such as
#           long names, end of line comments, include files, etc.)
#
#        FFLAGS (-O)
#           The Fortran compiler options to be used.
#
#        LINK (ln)
#           The command required to establish a link to a file.  The
#           default assumes POSIX.2 behavior, which only provides a
#           "hard" link operating within a single file system.  If the
#           host operating system allows "symbolic" links, then this
#           macro might be re-defined as 'ln -s'.  Alternatively, if the
#           use of multiple file systems is essential but not supported
#           by any form of link, then a copy command could be
#           substituted (e.g. 'cp -p'), at some cost in file space.
#
#        SOURCE_VARIANT ($SYSTEM)
#           The name used to distinguish between platform-specific
#           files.  Using the default ($SYSTEM) implies that multiple
#           copies of the same source may exist under different names.
#           For example, the files sub1.f_sun4 and sun1.f_sun4_Solaris
#           may contain identical source code.  If this is to be
#           avoided (to save space), edit this script to set
#           SOURCE_VARIANT to a suitable string - for example setting it
#           to "sun" would allow one copy of the source called
#           sub1.f_sun to be used. To do this, add to each of the
#           per-system sections a statement of the form:
#
#              SOURCE_VARIANT='string'
#
#        RANLIB (:)
#           The command required to "randomise" an object library.  By
#           default, this operation is not performed (the default acts
#           as a null command).  On systems which require it, this
#           should typically be set to 'ranlib'.
#
#        TAR_IN (pax -w -v -x ustar -f)
#           Command to use to insert a file into a .tar archive file.
#           The default uses the POSIX.2 pax command, which is not
#           available on traditional UNIX systems.  These typically use
#           a tar command such as 'tar -cvhf' instead (if symbolic
#           links are supported, then an option to follow these must be
#           included in this command).
#
#        TAR_OUT (pax -r -f)
#           Command to use to extract a file from a .tar archive file.
#           The default uses the POSIX.2 pax command, which is not
#           available on traditional UNIX systems.  These typically use
#           a tar command such as 'tar -xf' instead.
#
#  Implementation Deficiencies:
#     -  The implementation of shareable libraries on the alpha_OSF1
#        system is still preliminary.
