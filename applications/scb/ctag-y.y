*  Name:
*     ctag-y.y
* 
*  Type of module:
*     yacc grammar
* 
*  Purpose:
*     Specify minimal grammar of C source for tagging.
* 
*  Description:
*     This grammar specification provides enough understanding of C source
*     code, as tokenized by the corresponding lexical analyser, to be
*     able to identify and tag function definitions and invocations.
* 
*     It is impossible to do a proper parse of the C, since we don't
*     walk the include files so that we can't know about what identifiers
*     have been typedef'd and what preprocessor substitutions should be
*     made.  We therefore deliberately use a very basic model of how 
*     the C fits together.  In most (the large majority of) cases this 
*     should be adequate to spot the function definitions and 
*     invocations.
* 
*     Note that comments and preprocessor directives are dealt with 
*     by the lexical analyser, so that we can pretend here as far as
*     the token stream is concerned that they do not exist.
* 
*     The yylval values returned by the lexical analyser are all pointers
*     to char, which must be output in order.  These contain, as well
*     as the text of the tokens in question, all intervening whitespace,
*     comments, preprocessor directives etc.
* 
*  Authors:
*     MBT: Mark Taylor (STARLINK)
* 
*  History:
*     23-NOV-1999 (MBT):
*        Initial version.

*  Name:
*     canchor
* 
*  Invocation:
*     string = canchor( attrib, fname, f77flag )
* 
*  Purpose:
*     Generates an HTML-like anchor tag around a string.
* 
*  Arguments:
*     attrib = const char *
*        Gives the name of the attribute to be set to fname.  The sensible
*        values would be "href" and "name".
*     fname = char *
*        Gives the string to be used both as the contents of the tag,
*        and of the value of the attribute of the A tag.  This will be
*        free'd by the routine, so must previously have been malloc'd.
*        The argument may consist of any amount of text, but only the
*        identifier right at the end will be used as the attribute value
*        and tagged text.  Any leading text will be output preceding
*        the tag.
*     f77flag = int
*        If nonzero, then a '_' is appended to the attribute value.  This
*        is appropriate if it represents a fortran routine.
* 
*  Return Value:
*     Text tagged with an SGML A tag, such that if fname points to text
*     "leading text identifier" then the returned value will be 
*     "leading text<a attrib='identifier'>identifier</a>".
*     This is malloc'd by this routine so should subsequently be free'd.
* 
*  Description:
*     This routine generates an SGML tag surrounding the text given
*     by the fname argument.  The value of the attribute named by the
*     attrib argument is also fname.  The valid part of fname is supposed
*     to start at the first character and go on for as long as it 
*     constitutes a valid C identifier.  Any trailing characters are
*     appended after the tag, but don't form part of the tagged text or
*     attribute value.  The memory used by fname is free'd by this routine.

/*
*+
*  Name:
*     handle_error
*
*  Purpose:
*     Deal with a unit which the grammar cannot parse.
*
*  Description:
*     This routine takes over when the yacc 'error' state is detected.
*
*     The desired behaviour is either to print the line unaltered
*     (if the external variable 'strict' is false), or to terminate
*     processing with an error message (if strict is true).  Either
*     way we need the text which could not be parsed.
*
*     Since yacc pops everything off the stack before we are able to
*     intercept this and discards all the associated state, we cannot
*     use yylval as usual.  Instead, we use the ucontent() routine which
*     gets a string consisting of all the text the lexer has encountered
*     since the last uclear() was called.  Note that because of this 
*     interrelation between uclear() calls and handle_error() calls,
*     it is not OK to put an error token just anywhere in the grammar.
*
*     This routine also takes it upon itself to advance the lexer's 
*     input stream to somewhere suitable to start parsing again.
*     We take the questionable course of skipping until the next blank
*     line.  In practice (because of human habits not C syntax) this is 
*     likely to be a good choice.  We can't get yacc to do the skipping
*     forward itself because the lexer does not recognise and return
*     blanks of any kind.
