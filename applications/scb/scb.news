SCB -- Source Code Browser 
--------------------------

Indexer and extractor/HTML browser for source code comprising Starlink
packages.

v1.0-0 (December 1998):
   Initial release.

v1.0-1 (January 1999):
   Bugfixes and minor modifications.

v1.1-0 (December 1999):
   The package has been restructured in terms of where it installs itself.

   The source code parsing/tagging has been entirely rewritten using lex
   and yacc instead of the Perl/regular expression-based approach used in
   previous versions.  This is significantly more efficient in execution 
   time and memory for small and moderate-sized files and MUCH more 
   efficient for large ones and certain pathological cases which the 
   previous routines had trouble with.  It seems to be about as accurate - 
   that is certain things which the previous parser got right the new one
   doesn't, and vice versa.

   The indexer program may now be invoked with the flag '-update', in which
   case it will only perform indexing for files which do not appear to have
   up to date indexes already.

v1.1-1 (November 2001):
   Some modifications to the makefile (new private targets) to facilitate 
   CVS control of the source, and fixes to things which broke under perl/OS
   upgrades.

v1.1-2 (February 2003):
   Modified so that scb.pl can run without write access to the 
   SCB_BROWSER_TMP directory.  This will only work in cases where no
   untarring of source files needs to be done of course.

v1.1-3 (July 2003):
   Some minor changes to scbindex in response to issues that showed up 
   with Perl 5.8.
