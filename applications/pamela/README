Look inside "Makefile" to see how to set up pamela.

Mostly it is fairly straightforward, but there are a couple of
problems that you might encounter:

1) If everything links OK, but every command falls over saying
   "segmentation fault" before getting anywhere, you may be suffering
   from a problem of STARLINK and RedHat. This needs a different version
   of "libcurses.a" placed so that it is used during linking. Once you
   have done so, re-link pamela. See the STARLINK site for more detailed
   instructions. Ignore anything they may say about the problem being fixed
   under RedHat 7, it seems not to be true as far as I can tell. It has been
   encountered under RedHat 5, 6.2, 7.1 and 7.2.

2) You may encounter another problem with NDF which will occur as soon as you 
   try to run a routine as a result of running across a network. Redirecting 
   your ADAM_USER environment variable (with setenv) seems to be the way to cure 
   this; it likes this to be on your local machine.


Installing on Macs (intel)

Install the scisoft software suite from ESO, it has the pgplot that works (you
get loads of other stuff too e.g. IRAF):

http://web.mac.com/npirzkal/iWeb/Scisoft/Scisoft.html

For pgplot you need aquaterm (http://sourceforge.net/projects/aquaterm/)

You should install compilers: gcc (http://developer.apple.com/tools/),
gfortran (http://hpc.sourceforge.net/) and g95.

PGPLOT in the makefile should be set to:

PGPLOT     = -L$(PGDIR) -lpgplot -lgwm -lgfortran -laquaterm -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 

with PGDIR directed to the /scisoft version of pgplot
