# Dichroic ripple
# ---------------
# On WHT ISIS blue arm spectra, the dichroic "ripple" moves around, but there
# is not enough signal in a typical flat at the extreme blue end, so using
# "nearflat" directly can more than double the noise. To cope with this, we
# form a balance frame by extracting a spectral response from the balance
# frame created by "nearflat"  between  dichroic_ylo and dichroic_yhi and
# multiply it row-wise through  a dichroic_balance - a balance frame for which the 
# spectral response has been comletely divided out. (or for which the dichroic was
# taken out, or a unit frame).
# Note that these are figaro-style values i.e., pixel no. - 0.5
# To disable this feature, set dichroic_ylo=0 (or nearflat = 0).
# (PFLM 1 May 2001)
