      SUBROUTINE IRC1_SCOSB( IDC, SAMPLE, PSI, THETA, SOLONG, UTCS,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRC1_SCOSB

*  Purpose:
*     Returns boresight positions at a set of detector samples,
*     assuming SURVEY_BSIGHT data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRC1_SCOSB( IDC, SAMPLE, PSI, THETA, SOLONG, UTCS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Straight lines are fitted to the solar longitude and the clock
*     angle (PSI) samples stored in the DETAILS structure contained in
*     the CRDD file. These fits are evaluated at the times of the
*     required samples. Cone angle (THETA) is assumed constant
*     throughout the scan. See figure III.B.7 in the IRAS Catalogues
*     and Atlases Explanatory Supplement for definitions of THETA and
*     PSI. (Note, this routine uses PSI, not PHI, as the clock angle.
*     PSI = 2.PI - PHI ).
*
*     If this is the first time pointing information has been requested
*     from the given CRDD file, then the linear fits are found and the
*     gradients and intercepts stored in common. Also, the matrix which
*     rotates 3-vectors representing Cartesian equatorial (1950)
*     positions to Cartesian ecliptic (of date) positions is calculated
*     and stored in common. Later calls to this routine use the stored
*     information rather than calculating it all again.

*  Arguments:
*     IDC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The IRC identifier for the CRDD file.
*     SAMPLE = REAL (Given)
*        A fractional sample number. If BAD, then the corresponding
*        elements of the output arrays are set BAD.
*     PSI = REAL (Returned)
*        The cone angle at the specified sample (radians).
*     THETA = REAL (Returned)
*        The clock angle at the specified sample (radians).
*     SOLONG = REAL (Returned)
*        The solar longitude at the specified sample (radians), refered
*        to the mean equator and equinox at the time given by UTCS.
*     UTCS = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The absolute UTCS at the specified sample (seconds).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
