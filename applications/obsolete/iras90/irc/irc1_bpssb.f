      SUBROUTINE IRC1_BPSSB( IDC, NVAL, SAMPLE, DETIND, SCS, RA, DEC,

*+
*  Name:
*     IRC1_BPSSB

*  Purpose:
*     Returns boresight positions at a set of detector samples,
*     assuming SURVEY_BSIGHT data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRC1_BPSSB( IDC, NVAL, SAMPLE, DETIND, SCS, RA, DEC, ANGLE,
*                      SPEED, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Boresight positions are found by first fitting straight lines
*     to the solar longitude and the clock angle (PSI) samples stored in
*     the DETAILS structure contained in the CRDD file. These fits are
*     evaluated at the times of the required samples. Cone angle (THETA)
*     is assumed constant throughout the scan. See figure III.B.7
*     in the IRAS Catalogues and Atlases Explanatory Supplement for
*     definitions of THETA and PSI. (Note, this routine uses PSI, not
*     PHI, as the clock angle. PSI = 2.PI - PHI ). The clock angle, cone
*     angle and solar longitude values are then converted to the
*     corresponding RA and DEC values (B1950, FK4).
*
*     If this is the first time pointing information has been requested
*     from the given CRDD file, then the linear fits are found and the
*     gradients and intercepts stored in common. Also, the matrix which
*     rotates 3-vectors representing Cartesian equatorial (1950)
*     positions to Cartesian ecliptic (of date) positions is calculated
*     and stored in common. Later calls to this routine use the stored
*     information rather than calculating it all again.

*  Arguments:
*     IDC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The IRC identifier for the CRDD file.
*     NVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of samples in the input and output lists.
*     SAMPLE( NVAL ) = REAL (Given)
*        A list of fractional sample numbers. If any sample numebr is
*        BAD, then the corresponding elements of the output arrays are
*        set BAD.
*     DETIND( NVAL ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        A list of detector indices.
*     SCS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The Sky Coordinate System in which the boresight positions and
*        angles are returned. See the IRA_ documentation (ID/1) for more
*        information about Sky Coordinate Systems. The variable supplied
*        for argument SCS should have a declared length equal to the
*        symbolic constant IRA__SZSCS. This routine returns
*        SCS = EQUATORIAL(B1950).
*     RA( NVAL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        An array holding the RA value  (B1950, FK4) of the
*        boresight at the moment each sample specified in the input
*        lists was taken (radians).
*     DEC( NVAL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        An array holding the DEC value (B1950, FK4) of the
*        boresight at the moment each sample specified in the input
*        lists was taken (radians).
*     ANGLE( NVAL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The scan angle at the boresight. This is measured from
*        equatorial north to the positive focal plane Y axis.  The
*        angle is in radians and is measured positive in the same sense
*        as rotation from north to east.
*     SPEED( NVAL ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The scan speed in radians per second. Positive values imply
*        that sources move in the positive focal plane Y direction (i.e
*        in the "with-survey" direction). Negative values imply that
*        sources move in the negative Y direction (i.e. "anti-survey").
*        This routine returns the value stored in the CRDD_INFO
*        structure.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     15-MAR-1991 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     9-MAY-1991 (DSB):
*        Updated for IRA version 2.
*     25-AUG-1993 (DSB):
*        Changed to use IRC1_SCOSB rather than calculating PSI, THETA
*        and SOLONG itself.
*     23-JUN-1993 (DCP):
*        Add error check after IRC1_SCOSB, the program otherwise goes into
*        SLA routines which are not error checked and may produce
*        misleading messages.
