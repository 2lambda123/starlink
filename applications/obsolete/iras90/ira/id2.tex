\section {Introduction}
The IRA library (IRAS90 library A ) contains a set of subroutines which allow
applications running under ADAM on either VMS or UNIX platforms to access and
manipulate astrometry information specified by the application or stored within
two dimensional NDFs (see SUN/33 for information on the NDF data format). The
library forms a sub-system of the IRAS90 package, but there should be nothing to
prevent it being of use in other contexts. IRA provides astrometry facilities
for images. There is nothing IRAS-specific in this package which deals with the
relation between pixel and sky coordinates in an image. 

\subsection { The Relationship with the Starlink Astrometry Package}
At the current time no standards exists within Starlink for storing or accessing
astrometric information within NDFs. However, Starlink recognise the need for 
such standards and intend to address them in the near future. When such 
standards exist, software which uses other methods for handling astrometry will 
in general not be able to share data with software which uses the Starlink 
standards. The routines within IRA were designed bearing this in mind, with the 
intention that when the Starlink standard is defined the IRA routines will be 
re-written to use the new standards. It should be possible to do this in such a 
way as to leave the argument lists of all the IRA routines un-altered. This 
would mean that software which uses IRA will automatically be compatible with 
the Starlink standard once IRA has been modified. This provides an interim 
solution to the problem of handling astrometry information, while at the same 
time minimising the amount of effort which will be needed to upgrade the 
software to use the Starlink standard, when such a standard is produced.

\subsection {Facilities Available in the Current Implementation}
The IRA subroutines were designed to meet the needs of the IRAS90 package, and
as such will probably not provide as many facilities as the final Starlink
system, which will presumably have to cater for a wide range of positional
accuracies, dimensionalities, etc. The current IRA system provides facilities
for storing information within an NDF to enable the position of each image pixel
on the sky to be determined (for a limit number of projections), and the image
pixel with any given sky position to be determined. It also provides some
facilities for manipulating sky positions in various ways (eg spherical
trigonometry, formatting and decoding of text strings holding sky positions
etc), and several routines for doing astrometry oriented graphics such as
plotting sky coordinate grids, drawing great circles, etc. The current
implementation of IRA is referred to in this document as the ``interim''
implementation to distinguish it from the version based on the Starlink standard
which will eventually be produced (the use of the word {\em interim} in this
context should not be confused with the Starlink INTERIM environment). The next
section contains more detail about the sort of information which IRA handles. 

Astrometric functions that are specific to the IRAS data, such as those 
relating to the relative positions of the detectors in the IRAS focal plane are 
{\em not} included in this package but in the IRAS90 IRC package (see ID/1).

\section {Overview}

The IRA system is restricted to two dimensional images, in which the centre of 
each image pixel represents a point on the sky. Routines exist to relate a pixel
position to a position on the sky and vice-versa. This consists of a description
of the {\em projection} used to map the sky onto the image, and vice-versa, and
a description of the {\em coordinate system} produced by the projection. 

The primary purpose of IRA is the storage of information within an image to
enable later applications to transform between image pixel and sky position
coordinates. This is a ``global'' operation which relates to the entire image.
In this sense IRA is restricted to 2D images. A secondary purpose of IRA is to
provide useful routines for manipulating and displaying sky coordinates. These
routines can also be useful in processing non-image data, but the full
facilities of IRA are only available for 2D images. If an application wanted to
stack several images together into a 3D NDF (for example images taken at the
same position with the same pixel size but at several different wavelengths in
each of which the same pixels correspond to the same sky positions), then IRA
could be used as it stands so long as corresponding pixels from each plane of
the image stack have identical sky coordinates. In this sense, sky position is
independent of the third axis and is thus essentially 2D. 

\subsection {Image Coordinates}
In what follows, I will refer to the two coordinate systems as ``image
coordinates'' and ``sky coordinates''. 
A two dimensional image in which the
integer pixel indices range from $i_{low}$ to $i_{high}$ on the first
(``horizontal'' or ``X'') axis, and from $j_{low}$ to $j_{high}$ on the second
(``vertical'' or ``Y'') axis have image coordinates in the range $i_{low}-1$ to
$i_{high}$ and $j_{low}-1$ to $j_{high}$. Image coordinates are floating point
values in which the centre of the pixel with {\em indices }
$(1,1)$ has {\em image coordinates} $(0.5,0.5)$. Thus in the above example, image
coordinates $(i_{low}-1,j_{low}-1)$ refer to the bottom left corner of pixel
$(i_{low},j_{low})$, and image coordinates $(i_{high},j_{high})$ refers to the
top right corner of pixel $(i_{high},j_{high})$. See SSN/22 for another 
description of image coordinates (referred to in that document as ``picture 
coordinates'').

\subsection {Sky Coordinates}
\label {SEC:SCS}
Each point on the sky can be represented in several different sky coordinate
systems. IRA restricts sky coordinate systems to two dimensional, spherical
coordinates, representing longitude and latitude values on the celestial sphere.
The symbol ``$A$'' is used throughout IRA to refer to a longitude value, and the
symbol ``$B$'' to refer to a latitude value. All such values are given to and
returned from IRA in the form of double precision floating point variables, in
units of radians. No rules exist relating to the presence or absence of
multiples of $2.\pi$ within sky coordinate values (e.g a value of $4.5.\pi$ will
be accepted). A routine is provided (IRA\_NORM) to normalise longitude/latitude
pairs such that longitude is in the range $0$ to $2.\pi$ and latitude is in the
range $-\pi/2$ to $+\pi/2$. 

The sky coordinate systems currently supported by IRA are:
\begin {itemize}
\item Ecliptic (IAU 1980)
\item Equatorial (FK4 and FK5)
\item Galactic (IAU 1958)
\end{itemize}

Ecliptic and equatorial coordinates are referred to the mean equinox of a given
epoch. This epoch is specified within IRA by appending it to the end of the name
of the sky coordinate system, in parentheses; for instance EQUATORIAL(1983.5)
(only the four most significant decimal places are used). The epoch may be
preceded by a single character, B or J, indicating if the epoch is a Besselian
epoch (B) or a Julian epoch (J). If this character is missing (as in the above
example), then the epoch is assumed to be a Besselian epoch. If no equinox is
specified in this way, then a default of B1950.0 is used. 

If a Julian epoch is used to specify the reference equinox for an equatorial 
coordinate system, then the equatorial coordinates are assumed to be in the 
IAU 1976, FK5, Fricke system. If the equinox is specified using a Besselian 
epoch, then the coordinates are assumed to be in the FK4, Bessel-Newcomb system.

IRA provides routines to convert coordinates from one system to another,
including precession from one equinox to another if required. No corrections for
nutation are applied in this process. To ensure that all such conversions can be
performed, it is also necessary to store the Julian epoch of the observations. A
single mean epoch (1983.5D0) is sufficient to describe all IRAS data. This value
is available in the symbolic constant IRA\_\_IRJEP which can be made available
by following the instructions described in section \ref {SEC:CON}.

Throughout IRA sky coordinate systems are specified wither by an ``SCS'' value,
or by a ``NAME''. A name specifies the basic system and must be one of the list
given above (eg ``EQUATORIAL''). All IRA routines will accept any unambiguous
abbreviation for such a name. A name in this sense implies nothing about any
reference equinox, and so in general a name does not specify the sky coordinate
system completely. An SCS value consists of a name with an optional equinox
specifier appended to the end, as described above. If no equinox specifier is
contained in an SCS value, the default of B1950.0 is used (if necessary). 

\subsection {Projections}
\label {SEC:PARS}
Projections of the sky into an image can be described by mathematical
transformations between sky coordinates and image coordinates. Each of these
projections consist of two ``mappings''. The forward mapping converts image
coordinates to sky coordinates, and the inverse mapping converts sky coordinates
to image coordinates. Projection transformations are thus restricted to mappings
which convert a single pair of numbers, into another single pair of numbers (eg
$(X,Y)$ to $(RA,DEC)$ ). 

Currently, explicit support is restricted to the following four projections:
\begin {itemize}
\item Gnomonic (or ``tangent plane'') projection.
\item Lambert normal equivalent cylindrical projection.
\item Aitoff equal area projection.
\item Orthographic projection.
\end {itemize}
The basic algorithms to implement the first three of these projections are
described in the IRAS Catalogues and Atlases Explanatory Supplement, section
D.2, but have been extended to incorporate any orientation and scale for the
image axes, and an arbitrary reference point. The image axes are restricted to 
be perpendicular to each other on the sky, with rotation from the first (X) to 
the second (Y) image axes being in the sense of rotation from north to east 
(i.e. rotation from north to east is anti-clockwise when the image is displayed 
with X increasing left to right and Y increasing bottom to top).

The four supported projection are parameterised by eight parameters, as 
follows: 
\begin {enumerate}
\item The sky longitude (eg RA) of a ``reference'' point. This reference point 
usually has some geometric significance for the projection (eg for the Gnomonic,
or tangent plane projection, the reference point is the point on the sky at 
which the tangent plane touches the celestial sphere).
\item The sky latitude (eg DEC) of the reference point.
\item The position of the reference point along the first (X) image axis.
\item The position of the reference point along the second (Y) image axis.
\item The absolute size of a pixel along the first image axis.
\item The absolute size of a pixel along the second image axis.
\item The position angle of the second (Y) image axis on the sky with respect to
north.
\item An angle through which to rotate the celestial sphere before the
projection is performed (see below). 
\end {enumerate}

The rotation specified by the final parameter is about the radius vector from
the centre of the celestial sphere to the reference point, and thus corresponds
to ``tilting'' the celestial sphere rather than ``spinning'' it. The tilt is
positive in an anticlockwise direction when viewing the centre of the celestial
sphere from the reference position. For some projections (such as Gnomonic and
Orthographic) rotating the celestial sphere before projection has no effect.
This is because the projection surface for these projections is a plane, and is
therefore axisymetric about the radius passing through the reference point. For
other projections this is not true. For instance, the projection surface for the
Lambert normal equivalent cylindrical projection is a cylinder, and thus is {\em
not} axisymetric about the radius passing through the reference point. The
facility for rotating the celestial sphere prior to the projection gives another
degree of freedom in describing the projection, but for most applications the
final parameter will probably be given a value of zero.

See appendix \ref {APP:PROJ} for further information about these projections.

\subsubsection {The Interim Implementation}
IRA conceals the way in which projections are handled. This will hopefully make
it possible to re-implement IRA in terms of the official Starlink astrometry
system without changing any argument lists. In fact, the {\em interim} version
of IRA handles most projections by storing the projection name and projection
parameters in the NDF. Coordinate data are then transformed by calling an
appropriate IRA routine which performs the required projection. This is a
relatively fast way of doing things, but it restricts the projections which can
be used to those for which explicit IRA transformation routines exist. 

\section {Using IRA Subroutines}
This section gives a brief outline of the IRA routines which are available to 
perform some common tasks. The specific details required to use these routines 
are not included here but can be found in the subroutine specifications 
contained in appendix \ref {SEC:FULLSPEC}.

\subsection {Constants and Error Values}
\label {SEC:CON}
The IRA package has associated with it various symbolic constants defining such 
things as the required length of various character variables, the Julian epoch 
of the IRAS mission, etc. These values consist of a name of up to 5 characters 
prefixed by ``IRA\_\_''  (note the {\em double} underscore), and can be made 
available to an application by including the following lines at the start of the
routines which uses them:

\begin{verbatim}
      INCLUDE 'IRA_PAR'
\end{verbatim}


IRA\_PAR should be a logical name (on VMS) or symbolic links (on UNIX) pointing
to the appropriate files. 

Note, Fortran source files for use on UNIX systems can be automatically 
generated from those used on VMS systems, using the FORCONV program descibed
in SUN/111. This avoids the need to store and maintain two separate systems of
source files, and is highly recommended!

The values thus defined are described in the following sections, and also in the
subroutine specifications. Of particular use may be a set of multiplicative
constants for converting between various forms of representing angular values: 

\begin{description}
\item [IRA\_\_RTOD] - Factor for converting radians to degrees.
\item [IRA\_\_R2AS] - Factor for converting radians to arc-seconds.
\item [IRA\_\_R2AM] - Factor for converting radians to arc-minutes.
\item [IRA\_\_R2TS] - Factor for converting radians to seconds.
\item [IRA\_\_R2TM] - Factor for converting radians to minutes.
\item [IRA\_\_R2TH] - Factor for converting radians to hours.
\item [IRA\_\_DTOR] - Factor for converting degrees to radians.
\item [IRA\_\_AS2R] - Factor for converting arc-seconds to radians.
\item [IRA\_\_AM2R] - Factor for converting arc-minutes to radians.
\item [IRA\_\_TS2R] - Factor for converting seconds to radians.
\item [IRA\_\_TM2R] - Factor for converting minutes to radians.
\item [IRA\_\_TH2R] - Factor for converting hours to radians.

\end{description}

In addition, the following multiples of $\pi$ are defined:
\begin{description}
\item [IRA\_\_PI] - $\pi$
\item [IRA\_\_PIBY2] - $0.5*\pi$
\item [IRA\_\_TWOPI] - $2.0*\pi$
\end{description}

Another set of symbolic constants is made available by the statements

\begin{verbatim}
      INCLUDE 'IRA_ERR'
\end{verbatim}

These values have the same format of those contained in IRA\_PAR, put define
various error conditions which can be generated within the IRA package.
Applications can compare the $STATUS$ argument with these values to check for
specific error conditions. These values are described in appendix \ref
{APP:ERRORS}. 

\subsection{IRA Identifiers}
IRA can store astrometry information for many different pixel grids
simultaneously. To distinguish between them, IRA uses a system of
``identifiers''. An IRA identifier is an integer value which is used by IRA to
locate the astrometry information relating to a particular pixel grid. These
identifiers are generated by the IRA package and returned to the calling
application, which can then pass them to other IRA routines to specify which
astrometry information is to be used. When access is no longer needed by the
application to the astrometry information, the related IRA identifier should be
annulled using routine IRA\_ANNUL. This releases the resources used by the
astrometry information, so that it can be re-used. 

Note, IRA stores astrometry information internally within common arrays. The
identifiers used by IRA identify a particular set of values stored in common,
{\em not} the HDS structures which hold the astrometry information in the NDF.
Routines IRA\_IMPRT and IRA\_READ copy the astrometry information from the HDS
object, into internal common storage. Any modification made to the astrometry
information (such as by routine IRA\_ROT, etc) will only change the internally
held values, {\em not} the values stored in the NDF. To effect permanent changes
in the NDF values, the interbnally held astrometry information should be written
out using IRA\_CREAT, IRA\_EXPRT or IRA\_WRITE. This approach means that NDF
identifiers and HDS locators can be annulled by the calling application once the
astrometry information has been copied into internal storage. 

\subsection {Starting Up and Shutting Down}
The routine IRA\_INIT should be called before calling any IRA routines which has
an IRA identifier as an argument. It initialises the IRA internal common blocks
and annuls any currently active IRA identifiers. When all handling of
astrometry information has been completed, IRA\_CLOSE should be called which
ensures that all IRA identifiers have been annulled. IRA\_ACTIV can be used to 
see if IRA is currently active.

\subsection {Creation of New IRA Identifiers}
IRA identifiers are used to refer to a particular set of astrometry information.
Each identifier has associated with it information describing a projection, a
sky coordinate system and an observation epoch (this information is actually
stored within common blocks internal to IRA). IRA identifiers can be created by
any of the routines IRA\_CREAT, IRA\_IMPRT and IRA\_READ. The difference between
these routines lies in the source from which they obtain the astrometry
information. If the calling application already knows the projection name,
projection parameters, sky coordinate system and observation epoch, then
IRA\_CREAT can be called. As well as storing the astrometry information
internally and returning an IRA identifier for it, this routine also has an
option for storing the astrometry information in an NDF. If the astrometry
information is to be obtained from an NDF, then IRA\_IMPRT should be called. The
calling application gives an NDF identifier and a search is made through the NDF
for suitable astrometry information. Such information is then copied into the
IRA common blocks and an IRA identifier is returned for it. IRA\_READ is similar
to IRA\_IMPRT except that the calling application supplies a locator to an HDS
object rather than an NDF identifier. The astrometry information is read from
the specified HDS object and an IRA identifier returned for it. 

IRA identifiers should be annulled using IRA\_ANNUL when no longer needed. 

\subsection {Storing Astrometry Information within an NDF}
Astrometry information is stored within an NDF in an ``astrometry structure''.
In the interim implementation, this consists of an HDS object of HDS type
IRAS\_ASTROMETRY which is stored as a component within an NDF extension.
IRA\_EXPRT can be called to create an astrometry structure within an NDF if an
IRA identifier is already available for the astrometry information.
Alternatively, IRA\_CREAT can be called if no IRA identifier has yet been issued
for the astrometry information. By default, these routines create astrometry
structures within the ``IRAS'' extension, and the astrometry structure itself is
assumed to have an HDS name of ``ASTROMETRY''. These names may be changed by
calling the routine IRA\_LOCAT, making it possible for IRAS to be used for NDFs
which don't contain an IRAS extension. The names set up by the call to
IRA\_LOCAT remain in force until another call to IRA\_LOCAT or a call to
IRA\_INIT. 

The NDF must be open with WRITE or UPDATE access in order to create a new
astrometry structure. NB, the NDF extension which is to hold the astrometry
structure must already exist. If IRA\_CREAT or IRA\_EXPRT cannot find the
required NDF extension, it will return with $STATUS$ set to the value
IRA\_\_NOEXT. 

\subsection {Reading Astrometry Information from an NDF}
To handle astrometry information stored in an existing NDF, an identifier to the
NDF must first be obtained (eg using NDF\_ASSOC, see SUN/33). This is then
passed to the routine IRA\_IMPRT to import the astrometry information from the
NDF into IRA internal common blocks. IRA\_IMPRT searches through all available
NDF extensions until a suitable astrometry structure is found, and then copies
the information from the astrometry structure into the IRA internal common
blocks. It then returns an IRA identifier for the astrometry information which
can be passed to other IRA routines to gain access to the information stored in
common. The IRA identifier should be annulled using IRA\_ANNUL when it is no
longer needed. 

IRA\_FIND will locate the astrometry structure in an NDF but does not read the 
astrometry information into common. This routine can be used (for instance) to
locate the astrometry structure prior to deleting it.

IRA\_SCSEP can then be called to get the sky coordinate system (including an
equinox specifier if required) generated by the projection, and the Julian epoch
of the observations. 

IRA\_READ is like IRA\_IMPRT except that it reads the astrometry information 
out of a specified HDS object.

IRA\_TRACE can be used to display information about an existing astrometry 
information on the screen.

\subsection {Modifying Astrometry Information}
If the pixel values store in an image are moved around, the associated
astrometry information will no longer correctly describe the astrometry of the
image. The routines IRA\_MAG, IRA\_MOVE and IRA\_ROT can be used to modify
astrometry information to take account of various linear geometric
transformations which may be applied to the data. The transformations are
restricted to ones which will not alter the basic properties of the projection.
They are : 

\begin{itemize}
\item Shift the reference position to a different location in image coordinates
(see routine IRA\_MOVE).
\item Magnify the image by reducing the pixel size. Separate magnification 
factors can be specified for the X and Y axes (see routine IRA\_MAG).
\item Rotate the image coordinate system (see routine IRA\_ROT).
\end{itemize}

Note, these routines do not write the modified astrometry information back to 
any NDF or HDS object from which it may have been originally obtained. If the 
values are to be stored back in an NDF or HDS object then a call must be made to
IRA\_EXPRT or IRA\_WRITE.

\subsection {Transforming Coordinate Data}
The subroutine IRA\_TRANS can be used to transform coordinate values from image
coordinates to sky coordinates, or vice-versa, using the projection specified by
a given IRA identifier (the actual {\em name} of the projection is not
available to the application). If many data points are to be transformed, it is
faster to put the data into two arrays, and make a single call to IRA\_TRANS to
process them all, rather than making many calls to IRA\_TRANS to process a
single point each call. 

\subsection {Handling Formatted Sky Coordinates}
A formatted sky coordinate value consists of a character string holding a sky
coordinate value in character form, in a format which is readily usable by a
user. A single value can refer to either a longitude or a latitude value. A pair
of formatted sky coordinate values consists of one of each. Routines exist to 
convert from floating point values (in radians) to formatted strings, and
vice-versa, which allow several different formats for the strings. IRA\_CTOD and
IRA\_DTOC decode and encode a {\em pair} of floating point values, IRA\_CTOD1
and IRA\_DTOC1 handle {\em single} values. The encoding routines always ensure
that displayed longitude values are in the range zero to 360 degrees (or the
equivalent time range, zero to 24 hours) and that the displayed latitude is in
the range +90 degrees to -90 degrees. 

IRA\_GETCO gets a pair of sky coordinate values from the ADAM environment 
using the ADAM parameter system. Two parameters are used, one for each value.
For each, the user gives a string in a format acceptable to IRA\_CTOD.

\subsection {Mathematical Operations on Sky Coordinate Values}
Sky coordinate positions can be converted from one supported sky coordinate
system to another using IRA\_CONVT (which in turn calls various SLALIB routines,
see SUN/67). IRA\_PACON converts both sky positions {\em and} position angles. 
Any required precession is performed by these routines, but nutation is ignored.

The length of the arc joining two given sky positions can be found using
IRA\_DIST. Given two sky positions and a position angle (measured from north
through east in the current sky coordinate system), IRA\_DIST2 returned two
arc-distances, which are the distances which must be moved parallel and
perpendicular to the given position angle in order to move from the first sky
position to the second. 

Two routines exist for finding a sky position which is a given distance away
from a reference sky position. They differ in how the direction of movement is
defined. IRA\_OFFST moves away from the reference point, towards a specified
second point. IRA\_SHIFT moves away from the reference point at a given position
angle (measured north through east in the current sky coordinate system). 

Redundant multiple of $2.\pi$ can be removed from a pair of sky coordinate 
values by calling IRA\_NORM. This routine ensures that longitude values are in 
the range zero to $2.\pi$, and latitude values are in the range $+\pi/2$ to 
$-\pi/2$.

\subsection {Encoding and Decoding Equinox Specifiers}
Certain sky coordinate systems (eg ECLIPTIC and EQUATORIAL) are referred to the
mean equinox of a given epoch. This equinox is specified by appending the epoch
to the name of the sky coordinate system as described in section \ref {SEC:SCS}.
The routine IRA\_SETEQ can be used to do the character string manipulation
required to do this. The routine IRA\_GETEQ will do the opposite of this; given
an SCS string it will return the name of the sky coordinate system, the floating
point epoch value, and a character indicating if the epoch is Besselian or
Julian. 

The routine IRA\_GTSCS will get a complete SCS string (including equinox 
specifier) from the ADAM environment, using a specified ADAM parameter.

\subsection {Graphics}
Routines are provided for producing astrometry related graphics. These routines
plot within a nominated section of the current SGS zone. Routines are available
for drawing individual meridians, parallels and great circles, for plotting
formatted coordinate values, and for drawing a boundary around the region
containing valid sky coordinates. A routine is provided which packages these in
order to produce a labelled sky coordinate grid. The accuracy of plotted curves
can be specified by the calling application to give the required play-off
between accuracy and speed of execution. 

\subsection {Calculating Pixel Bounds Required to Cover a Given Area of Sky}
When creating an image from scratch, it is often necessary to determine the
pixel bounds which will result in the image covering a given area of sky. The
area is usually specified by giving the sky coordinates of the centre of the
image, and the size of the image (i.e. an arc-length in radians) along both
axes. Since pixel size in general varies across an image it is not always
sufficient to divide the required size of an image by the ``nominal'' pixel size
to get the dimension of the image in pixels. The routine IRA\_XYLIM finds the 
pixel bounds which result in the two image axes having the required arc-length.

\subsection {Miscellaneous Routines}
IRA\_SCNAM will return a description of each axis of the sky coordinate system,
and an abbreviation of its name. For example, when using an equatorial sky
coordinate system, the description of the first axis is ``Right Ascension'' and
the abbreviation is ``RA''. 

\subsection {Demonstration Applications}
Two demonstration applications are available in IRA\_DIR which give examples of
the use of most of the IRA routines. IRA\_DEMO1 produces an NDF containing an
image of an artificial ``patchwork'' sky mapped using a requested projection,
and an astrometry structure which describes this image. The image can be
displayed etc, using KAPPA. IRA\_DEMO2 accepts an NDF as input, locates an
astrometry structure within it and uses the information to convert user supplied
coordinates from image to sky coordinates or vice-versa. 

\section {Compiling and Linking with IRA}
\label{SEC:LINK}
This section describes how to compile and link applications which use IRA
subroutines, on both VMS and UNIX systems. It is assumed that the IRAS90 package
is installed as part of the Starlink Software Collection.

\subsection{VMS}
Each terminal session which is to include the compilation or linking of 
applications which use the IRA package should start by issuing the commands:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ADAMSTART
$ ADAMDEV
$ IRAS90
$ IRAS90_DEV
\end{verbatim}

These commands set up logical names related to all the IRAS90
subsystems, including IRA. 

To link a VMS ADAM application with the IRA package, the linker options file
IRAS90\_LINK\_ADAM should be used. For example, to compile and link an ADAM
application called PROG with the IRA library, the following commands should be
used: 

\begin{verbatim}
$ ADAMSTART
$ ADAMDEV
$ IRAS90
$ IRAS90_DEV
$ FORT PROG
$ ALINK PROG, IRAS90_LINK_ADAM/OPT 
\end{verbatim}

Stand-alone (i.e. non-ADAM) applications can be linked with the ``standalone''
version of IRA. This version excludes the routines described in appendix
\ref{APP:ADAM}. To do this the link options file IRAS90\_LINK should be used
instead of IRAS90\_LINK\_ADAM. Thus to compile and link a stand-alone
application with the IRA package, the following commands should be given: 

\begin{verbatim}
$ IRAS90
$ IRAS90_DEV
$ FORT PROG
$ LINK PROG, IRAS90_LINK/OPT 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{UNIX}


Each terminal session which is to include the compilation or linking of 
applications which use any IRAS90 sub-package should do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Execute the {\bf iras90} command. This sets up an alias for the 
{\bf iras90\_dev} command.

\item Execute the {\bf iras90\_dev} command.  This creates soft links
within the current directory to
all the iras90 include files, defines an environment variable IRAS90\_SRC
pointing to the IRAS90 source directory, adds the {\bf bin}
sub-directory of IRAS90\_SRC on to the end of the current value for the
environment variable PATH, and adds the {\bf lib} sub-directory of 
IRAS90\_SRC on to the end of the current value for the environment 
variable LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH. The command {\bf iras90\_dev star} will do
the same but will also create soft links to all starlink include files
(i.e. all files in the directory /star/include).

\item If a UNIX application accesses any include files (such as
IRA\_PAR) then they should be specified (within the source file) in upper case 
without any directory
path. The I90\_PAR file (for instance) can be included using the statement

\verb+      INCLUDE 'I90_PAR'+\\

\item Soft links can be deleted (using the {\bf rm} command) when no longer 
needed.
The command {\bf iras90\_dev remove} will remove all IRAS90 soft links from
the current directory. The command {\bf iras90\_dev remove star} will
remove all IRAS90 and Starlink soft links from the current directory.
Note, soft links are only accessable in the directory from which the {bf ln} 
or {\bf iras90\_dev} command was issued. 
\item For ADAM applications the following {\bf alink} command should be used:

\verb+% alink prog.f -L$IRAS90_SRC/lib `ira_link_adam`+\\

where {\bf prog.f} is the fortran source file for the ATASK.
Note the use of opening apostrophies (`) instead of the more usual closing
apostrophy (') in the above {\bf alink} command.

\item For a stand-alone program the following {\bf f77} command should be used:

\verb+% f77 prog.f -o prog -L$IRAS90_SRC/lib `ira_link`+\\
\end{enumerate}

      The projection used is specified by the argument PROJ, and must
      be one of the supported projection types (see routine IRA\_IPROJ).
      For more information on the available projections, see the ID/2
      appendix {\tt "}Projection Equations{\tt "}. Each projection requires the
      values for several parameters to be supplied in argument P. These
      parameters have the same meaning for all projections (for further
      details see ID/2 appendix {\tt "}Projection Equations{\tt "}):

      P(1): The longitude (in the Sky Coordinate System specified by
            argument SCS) of the reference point in radians.

      P(2): The latitude (in the Sky Coordinate System specified by
            argument SCS) of the reference point in radians.

      P(3): The first image coordinate (i.e. X value) of the reference
            point. Image coordinates are fractional values in which the
            centre of the pixel (1,1) has coordinates (0.5,0.5).

      P(4): The second image coordinate (i.e. Y value) of the
            reference point.

      P(5): The size along the X image axis, of a pixel centred at the
            reference point, in radians. Actual pixel size will vary
            over the image due to the distorting effect of the
            projection. The absolute value is used.

      P(6): The size along the Y image axis, of a pixel centred at the
            reference point, in radians. The absolute value is used.

      P(7): The position angle of the Y image axis, in radians. That is,
            the angle from north to the positive direction of the Y
            image axis, measured positive in the same sense as
            rotation from north to east. (Here {\tt "}north{\tt "} and {\tt "}east{\tt "} are
            defined by the value of SCS). The X image axis is 90 degrees
            west of the Y axis.

      P(8): An angle through which the celestial sphere is to be rotated
            before doing the projection. The axis of the rotation is a
            radius passing through the reference point. The rotation is
            in an anti-clockwise sense when looking from the reference
            point towards the centre of the celestial sphere. The value
            should be in radians. Changing this angle does not change
            the orientation of the image axes with respect to north
            (which is set by p(7)).

   Converts formatted sky coordinate values into double precision
   values
}{
   \sstdescription{
      The input strings are presumed to hold sky coordinate values in
      character form.  This routine reads the strings and produces
      double precision values holding the coordinate values, in
      radians.

      Each input string can consist of a set of up to three {\tt "}fields{\tt "}.
      Each field starts with a numeric value (which can have a
      fractional part) terminated by a character string. This character
      string consists of an optional single character, called the
      terminator character, followed by an arbitrary number of spaces
      The terminator character (if present) must be one of the letters
      h,d,m,s or r.  An h terminator indicates that the field value is
      in units of hours. A d terminator indicates that the field value
      is in units of degrees.  An r terminator indicates that the field
      value is in units of radians.  An m terminator indicates that the
      field value is in units of minutes.  An s terminator indicates
      that the field value is in units of seconds.  The interpretation
      of minutes and seconds depends on whether the value is a time
      value or an angle value. The longitude value for equatorial sky
      coordinate systems (RA) is expected to be a measure of time, all
      other coordinate values are expected to be a measure of angle.
      These defaults are overriden if the first field is a {\tt "}degrees{\tt "},
      {\tt "}hours{\tt "} or {\tt "}radians{\tt "} field (as indicated by the presence of a d,
      h or r terminator character).  The interpretation of fields with
      no terminator character depends on which field is being
      considered. If the first field has no terminator, it is assumed
      to be either a degrees or hours field.  If the second or third
      field has no terminator, it is assumed to be a seconds field if
      the previous field was a minutes field, and a minutes field if
      the previous value was an hours or degrees field.

      In addition, an input string may contain a single field with no
      terminator character in an {\tt "}encoded{\tt "} form. {\tt "}Encoded{\tt "} fields are
      identified by the fact that the field contains 5 or more digits
      to the left of the decimal point (including leading zeros if
      necessary).  These fields are decoded into hours or degrees as
      follows: Any fractional part is taken as the fractional part of
      the seconds field, the tens and units digits are taken as the
      integer part of the seconds field, the hundreds and thousands
      digits are taken as the minutes fields, the remaining digits are
      taken as the degrees or hours field. Thus -12345.4 would be
      interpreted as (- 1 hour 23 mins 45.4 seconds) or (- 1 degree 23
      mins 45.4 seconds). The same value could also be specified as
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         1 23 45.5, -1h 23m 45.5s (if it represents a time value), or

         \sstitem
         1d 23 45.5 (if it represents an angular value).

      }
      The supplied values must be in their first order ranges (i.e. 0
      to 2.PI for longitude values and -PI/2 to $+$PI/2 for latitude
      values). Values outside these ranges cause an error to be
      reported, and the status value IRA\_\_RANGE is returned). The
      exception to this is if the string is prefixed with a {\tt "}$*${\tt "}
      character, in which case any numeric value may be supplied. In
      this case the supplied value is returned directly (eg if the
      string {\tt "}$*$400D{\tt "} is given, the radian equivalent of 400 degrees
      will be returned, not 40 (=400-360) degrees).  If either of the
      input strings are blank the corresponding output value is set to
      the Starlink {\tt "}BAD{\tt "} value (VAL\_\_BADD).

      By default, Equatorial and Ecliptic coordinates are referred to

      as an {\tt "}equinox specifier{\tt "} to the end of the SCS name (in fact all
      IRA routines will accept any unambiguous abbreviation of the SCS
      name). An equinox specifier consists of a year with upto 4
      decimal places, preceded with the letter B or J to indicate a
      Besselian or Julian epoch, and enclosed in parentheses. The
      named coordinate system is then referred to the mean equinox of
      the epoch given in the equinox specifier. The following are
      examples of legal SCS values; EQUATORIAL(B1950), EQUAT(J2000),
      ECLIP, ECLIP(1983.2534), etc. If the date is not preceded with
      either B or J (as in the last example), a Besselian epoch is
      assumed.

      The currently supported sky coordinate systems are:

      EQUATORIAL

             The longitude axis is Right Ascension, the latitude axis
             is Declination. Other legal names can be made by appending
             an equinox specifier (eg EQUATORIAL(B1983.5) ). If no
             equinox specifier is added, the coordinates are referred
             to the mean equinox of Besselian epoch 1950.0. If the
             equinox is described by a Besselian epoch, the old FK4
             Bessel-Newcomb system is used. If a Julian epoch is used,
             the new IAU 1976, FK5, Fricke system is used.

      GALACTIC

             The longitude axis is galactic longitude and the latitude
             axis is galactic latitude, given in the IAU 1958 galactic
             coordinate system.

      ECLIPTIC

             The longitude axis is ecliptic longitude and the latitude
             axis is ecliptic latitude. Other legal names can be made
             by appending an equinox specifier (eg ECLIPTIC(B1983.5) ).
             If no equinox specifier is added, the coordinates are
             referred to the mean equinox of Besselian epoch 1950.0.

\section {Templates for IRA Routines Within the VAX LSE Editor}
The STARLSE package (see SUN/105) provides facilities for initialising the VAX
Language Sensitive Editor (LSE) to simplify the generation of Fortran
code conforming to the Starlink programming standard (see SGP/16). One of the
facilities provided by LSE is the automatic production of argument lists for
subroutine calls. Templates for all the subroutines in the IRA package can be 
made available within LSE by performing the following steps (within LSE):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Issue the LSE command GOTO FILE/READ IRA\_DIR:IRA.LSE
\item Issue the LSE command DO
\item Issue the LSE command DELETE BUFFER
\item Move to a buffer holding a .FOR of a .GEN file in the usual way.
\item IRA subroutine templates are then available by typing in the name of an 
IRA subroutine (or an abbreviation) and expanding it (CTRL-E).
\item Help on the subroutine and its arguments can be obtained by placing the
cursor at a point in the buffer at which the subroutine name has been entered 
and pressing GOLD-PF2.
\end{enumerate}

\section {HDS Data Structures}
The interim implementation of IRA reads and writes externally held astrometry
information to and from HDS objects of type IRAS\_ASTROMETRY. This will be
replaced by a Starlink structure when such a structure is defined. The interim
structure contains the following components: 
\begin {description}

\item [SCS] - A primitive value of type \_CHAR$*$(IRA\_\_SZSCS). This component
is mandatory and must contain the name of the sky coordinate system (including 
equinox specifier) created by the forward mapping of the projection. 

\item [EPOCH] - A primitive value of type \_DOUBLE. This component
is mandatory and must contain the Julian epoch of the observations described by 
the astrometry structure.

\item [STATE] - A primitive value of type \_CHAR$*$(IRA\_\_SZSTA). This
component is mandatory and is used to confirm that the astrometry structure is
valid. If this component has any value other than ``DEFINED'' the astrometry 
structure is considered to be invalid.

\item [PROJ\_NAME] - A primitive value of type \_CHAR$*$(IRA\_\_SZPRJ). This
component contains the name of the projection to be used when transforming
coordinate data. 

\item [PROJ\_PARS] - An array of primitive values of type \_DOUBLE. The array
has a single dimension with size given by IRA\_\_MAXP, and contains values to
use for the parameters needed to defined the projection given by component
PROJ\_NAME. 

\end {description}

\section {Adding New Sky Coordinate Systems and Projections}
To add new sky coordinate systems or projections to the interim implementation
of IRA, the following procedures should be followed: 

\subsection {Sky Coordinate Systems}
\begin {enumerate}

\item Edit file IRA\_PAR.FOR to increase the value of IRA\_\_SZCLS by the 
length of the new SCS name plus one. If necessary, also change the values of
IRA\_\_SZSCS, IRA\_\_SZFSC, IRA\_\_SZSCA, IRA\_\_SZSCD to allow for the new
name. 

\item Explicit reference to the new SCS name should then be included in the
following routines; IRA1\_CHSCS, IRA1\_ICONV, IRA1\_IDTC1, IRA1\_IPACO, 
IRA1\_ISCNM, IRA\_DTOC, IRA\_ISCS, IRA\_SCNAM.

\item New routines should be written to convert coordinates from each of the 
supported sky coordinates systems, to the new system, and vice-versa. Calls
to these routines should be included in routines IRA1\_ICONV and IRA1\_IPACO.

\item Every routine in IRA should then be recompiled, and stored in a new object
library to replace the old object library. 

\item This document (ID2) should be edited to include the new SCS name. The
SST command PROLAT should be used to regenerate the full routine specifications.

\end {enumerate}

\subsection {Projections}
\begin {enumerate}

\item Edit file IRA\_PAR.FOR to increase the value of IRA\_\_SZPLS by the 
length of the new projection name plus one. If necessary, also change the values
of IRA\_\_SZPRJ and IRA\_\_MAXP to allow for the new projection. 

\item A subroutine should be written to perform the forward and inverse mappings
on arrays of input coordinate data. The argument list for this routine should
match that of IRA1\_GNOM, which should be studied as an example of how such
routines should behave. It is important to make this routine as efficient as
possible, and have an accuracy of a fraction of an arc-second. 

\item Subroutine IRA1\_IPRJ should then be modified to include a
call to the new subroutine. 

\item A subroutine should be written to which checks if the forward and inverse 
mappings would produce valid results given some input positions. This is 
different to the previous subroutine in that it doesn't actually evaluate the 
results of the transformation. The argument list for this routine should
match that of IRA1\_VGNOM, which should be studied as an example of how such
routines should behave. It is important to make this routine as efficient as
possible.

\item Subroutine IRA\_VALID should then be modified to include a
call to the new subroutine. 

\item Explicit reference to the new projection name should then be included in
the routine IRA\_IPROJ.

\item Every routine in IRA should then be recompiled, and stored in a new object
library to replace the old object library. 

\item This document (ID2) should be edited to include the new projection name.
The SST command PROLAT should be used to regenerate the full routine
specifications. 

\end {enumerate}

\section {Projection Equations}
\label {APP:PROJ}

This section describes equations used to implement the forward and inverse
mappings for the Gnomonic, Lambert cylindrical, Aitoff and Orthographic
projections. The equations for the first three are derived from those contained
in the IRAS Catalogs and Atlases Explanatory Supplement (Exp. Supp.), pages X-30
to X-32, while the Orthographic projection is derived from those described in
the IPAC Report ``A User's Guide to IRAS Pointed Observation Products'',
Appendix B. 

Throughout this appendix the following symbolic values will be used:

\begin{description}

\item [$(A,B)$] - the sky coordinates (longitude and latitude) of a general 
point on the celestial sphere, in radians.

\item [$(X,Y)$] - the image coordinates corresponding to sky coordinates 
$(A,B)$, in units of pixels.

\item [$(A_{l},B_{l})$] - the local coordinates (longitude and latitude, see
below) corresponding to sky coordinates $(A,B)$, in units of radians. 

\item [$(U,V)$] - the ``$(U,V)$'' coordinates (see below) corresponding to sky 
coordinates $(A,B)$, in units of radians.

\item [$(A_{0},B_{0})$] - the sky coordinate of the reference point. 
These are the same as projection parameters P(1) and P(2) (see section \ref 
{SEC:PARS}).

\item [$(X_{0},Y_{0})$] - the image coordinate of the reference point. 
These are the same as projection parameters P(3) and P(4) (see section \ref 
{SEC:PARS}).

\item [$(\Delta_{x},\Delta_{y})$] - the nominal dimensions of an image pixel
in the $X$ and $Y$ directions, as measured on the celestial sphere,in radians.
In fact, due to the distorting effect of the projection, only pixels close to
the reference point will actually have these dimensions. These are the same as
the absolute values of projection parameters P(5) and P(6). 

\item [$\theta$] - The position angle of the image $Y$ axis on the celestial
sphere, measured in radians, from north through east. North is the direction of
increasing sky latitude and east is the direction of increasing sky longitude,
in the current sky coordinate system. This is the same as projection parameter
P(7). The image $X$ axis is $\pi/2$ radians to the west of the $Y$ axis. 

\item [$\phi$] - The tilt of the celestial sphere prior to projection, given by 
projection parameter P(8), in radians. This is positive in an anti-clockwise
direction when looking along the radius vector of the celestial sphere from the 
reference point to ther centre.

\end{description}

In addition to image and sky coordinates, the IRA projection routines use two 
extra coordinate systems, called the ``$(U,V)$'' coordinate system and the 
``local'' coordinate system. These systems are only used internally within 
IRA. Non of the user-callable routines make any reference to them. All the 
projection transformations described below transform between $(U,V)$ and local 
coordinates, not directly between image and sky coordinates. Conversion to and 
from the various coordinate systems is performed as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item When performing a forward mapping from image coordinates $(X,Y)$ to sky
coordinates $(A,B)$, the input image coordinates are first transformed into the
corresponding $(U,V)$ values. The forward mapping for the required projection is
then applied to these $(U,V)$ values to get the corresponding local coordinates.
Finally, these local coordinates are transformed into the corresponding sky
coordinates. 

\item When performing an inverse mapping from sky coordinates $(A,B)$ to image 
coordinates $(X,Y)$, the input sky coordinates are first transformed into 
the corresponding local coordinate values. The inverse mapping for the required 
projection is then applied to these local coordinates to get the corresponding 
$(U,V)$ values. Finally, these $(U,V)$ values are transformed into the 
corresponding image coordinates $(X,Y)$.

This use of local coordinates ensures that the properties of the projections are
not invalidated. For instance, The Lambert equivalent cylindrical and Aitoff
projections are both known as equal area projections, meaning that pixels have
the same size on the sky (but not the same shape) over the entire image. This is
only true if the celestial sphere is not rotated prior to projection (i.e. only
if $\phi=0$) and if the reference point is on the equator (i.e. only if
$B_{0}=0$). In order for such projections to be used for other values of $\phi$
or $B_{0}$, the sky coordinates must be transformed to a system in which the
equivalents of $\phi$ and $B_{0}$ {\em are} zero. Using the local coordinates
described above achieves this. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection {The $(U,V)$ Coordinate System} 
The $(U,V)$ system is a Cartesian coordinate system on the projection surface.
The origin is located at the reference point. The $V$ axis is tangential (at the
$(U,V)$ origin) to north in the local coordinate system, and the $U$ axis is
tangential to local west. Both axes are in units of radians. The transformation
between $(U,V)$ and $(X,Y)$ consists of a rotation (equal to $\theta-\phi$) to
put the image Y axis at the request position angle in sky coordinates, a shift
to put the reference point at the requested image coordinates, and a scaling to
give pixels the correct dimensions. The transformation equations are:

\begin{eqnarray*}
U & = & cos( \theta - \phi )*(X - X_{0})*\Delta_{x} + 
        sin( \theta - \phi )*(Y - Y_{0})*\Delta_{y}\\
V & = & cos( \theta - \phi )*(Y - Y_{0})*\Delta_{y} -
        sin( \theta - \phi )*(X - X_{0})*\Delta_{x}
\end{eqnarray*}
and 
\begin{eqnarray*}
X & = & cos( \theta - \phi )*(U/\Delta_{x}) + X_{0} -
        sin( \theta - \phi )*(V/\Delta_{y}) + Y_{0}\\
Y & = & cos( \theta - \phi )*(V/\Delta_{y}) + Y_{0} +
        sin( \theta - \phi )*(U/\Delta_{x}) + X_{0}
\end{eqnarray*}

Note, the variables $SAMPLE$ and $LINE$ referred to in the Exp. Supp.
are replaced in this appendix by $(U.scale.180/\pi)$ and $(-V.scale.180/\pi)$
where $scale$ is defined in the Exp. Supp. 

\subsection {The ``Local'' Coordinate System} 
The ``local'' coordinate system is a spherical coordinate system on the
celestial sphere. The local longitude is designated $A_{l}$ and the local
latitude is designated $B_{l}$. A position on the celestial sphere can be
described both by sky coordinates (eg GALACTIC etc) and by the corresponding
local coordinates. Local coordinates are defined so that the reference point has
local longitude and latitude values of zero, and so that north (in the local
system) at the reference point is at position angle $\psi$ in the sky coordinate
system. Thus the $U$ axis is always at position angle $-\pi/2$ in local
coordinates, and the $V$ axis is always at position angle zero. Also, the
reference point ( $(U,V)=(0,0)$  ) is always at $(A_{l},B_{l})=(0,0)$. 

It is useful to introduce a 3-D Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y,z)$ (see
figure \ref {FIG:A}) to describe the mapping from sky coordinates to local
coordinates (lower case $(x,y,z)$ should not be confused with upper case $(X,Y)$
used to signify image coordinates). The origin of this system is at the centre
of the celestial sphere, the $x$ axis is towards the point on the celestial
sphere with zero longitude and zero latitude, the $y$ axis is towards the point
with longitude $+\pi/2$ and latitude zero, and the $z$ axis is the polar axis
towards latitude $+\pi/2$. The mapping from sky coordinates to local coordinates
is constructed as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}

\item Initially the sky $(x,y,z)$ axes coincides with the local $(x,y,z)$ 
axes.

\item Rotate the local $(x,y,z)$ system about the local $z$ axis by an angle
$A_{0}$ (see figure \ref {FIG:B}). This results in the $x$ and $y$ axes no
longer being coincident for sky and local coordinates. The reference point then
has zero longitude in the local system. Positive rotation is anti-clockwise when
viewed from the positive end of the rotation axis. 

\item Rotate the new local $(x,y,z)$ system about the local $y$ axis by an angle
$-B_{0}$ (see figure \ref {FIG:C}). This results in the $z$ axis no longer being
coincident for sky and local coordinates. The reference point now has zero
longitude and latitude in the local system. 

\item Rotate the new local $(x,y,z)$ system about the local $x$ axis by an angle
$-\phi$ (see figure \ref {FIG:D}). Local north is then at a position angle
$\phi$ in the original sky coordinate system. 

\end{enumerate}

and latitude are measured in the current sky coordinate system. The radial 
vector shows the direction of the reference point, which is defined by the sky 
longitude and latitude values $A_{0}$ and $B_{0}$. When transforming from sky 
coordinates to ``local'' coordinates, the $(x,y,z)$ axes defined in the two
systems are initially considered to be coincident. This is indicated here by 
the absence of the ``Sky'' or ``Local'' axis prefixes used in later figures.

point in the sky coordinate system. This causes the ``Sky $x$'' and ``Local

local $(x,y,z)$ system about the local $x$ axis by the angle $\psi$

effect the position of the reference point which still has longitude and 
latitude of zero in the local system. However, local north at the reference 
point (i.e. the direction of increasing local latitude, or of the great circle 
joining the reference point to the local $z$ axis) is now at position angle
$\psi$ in the original sky coordinate system.

\subsection {The Gnomonic Projection}
The Gnomonic (or tangent plane) projection is a geometric projection from the
centre of the celestial sphere onto a plane which is tangent to the celestial
sphere at the reference point. The Gnomonic projection is used (for example) 
for the IRAS 16.5 degree extended emission SKYPLATE images. Varying projection
parameter P(8) has no effect on the projection because the projection surface 
is symetric about the radius vector of the celestial sphere passing through the
reference point.

Using local coordinates rather than sky coordinates means that the reference
point has both longitude and latitude equal to zero. The equation in the Exp.
Supp. are thus significantly simplified. 

\subsubsection {The Inverse Mapping}
The inverse mapping from local coordinates $(A_{l},B_{l})$ to $(U,V)$
coordinates (called the {\em forward} transformation in the Exp. Supp.) is
defined by the following equations: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
U & = & -\tan A_{l}\\
V & = & \frac{\tan B_{l}}{\cos A_{l}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsubsection {The Forward Mapping}
The forward mapping from $(U,V)$ coordinates to local coordinates
$(A_{l},B_{l})$ (called the {\em reverse} transformation in the Exp. Supp.) is
defined by the following equations: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
A_{l} & = & \arctan \left( \frac{-U}{-V} \right)\\
B_{l} & = & \arcsin \left(\frac{V}{\sqrt{U^{2}+V^{2}+1}} \right) 
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection {The Orthographic Projection}
Like the Gnomonic projection, the Orthographic projection is a geometric
projection onto a plane which is tangent to the celestial sphere at the
reference point. The difference between the two projections lies in the point
from which the projection proceeds. The Gnomonic projection proceeds from the
centre of the celestial sphere, whereas the Orthographic projection proceeds
from a point at infinity, diametrically opposite the reference point (i.e. the
projection lines are all normal to the tangent plane). The Orthographic
projection is used (for example) for the IRAS Pointed Observation images. 
Varying projection parameter P(8) has no effect on the projection because the
projection surface is symetric about the radius vector of the celestial sphere
passing through the reference point. 

Again, working in local coordinates means that the reference point is always at 
$(A_{l},B_{l})=(0,0)$ which results in great simplification of the equations.

\subsubsection {The Inverse Mapping}
The inverse mapping from local coordinates $(A_{l},B_{l})$ to $(U,V)$
coordinates is defined by the following equations:

\begin{eqnarray*}
U & = & -\cos B_{l}.\sin A_{l}\\
V & = & \sin B_{l}
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsubsection {The Forward Mapping}
The forward mapping from $(U,V)$ coordinates to local coordinates 
$(A_{l},B_{l})$ is defined by the following equations:

\begin{eqnarray*}
A_{l} & = & \arcsin \left( \frac{-U}{\sqrt{1-V^{2}}} \right)\\
B_{l} & = & \arcsin V
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection {The Lambert Equivalent Cylindrical Projection}
The Lambert equivalent cylindrical projection is a geometric projection from the
polar axis of the celestial sphere onto a cylinder which is tangential to the
celestial sphere at the equator. The projection proceeds normally to the polar
axis. It is used, for example, by the IRAS Galactic Plane images. It is an equal
area projection (i.e. all image pixels are the same size on the sky, but have
varying ``aspect ratio''). Varying projection parameter P(8) changes the nature
of the projection because the cylindrical projection surface is not symetric
about the radius vector of the celestial sphere passing through the reference
point. 

The cylinder is tangent at the equator of the local coordinate system. In sky 
coordinates the cylinder is tangent at a great circle passing through the 
reference point at a position angle of $\theta+\pi/2$.

\subsubsection {The Inverse Mapping}
The inverse mapping from local coordinates $(A_{l},B_{l})$ to $(U,V)$
coordinates (called the {\em forward} transformation in the Exp. Supp.) is
defined by the following equations: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U & = & -A_{l}\\
V & = & \sin B_{l}
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsubsection {The Forward Mapping}
The forward mapping from $(U,V)$ coordinates to local coordinates
$(A_{l},B_{l})$ (called the {\em reverse} transformation in the Exp. Supp.) is
defined by the following equations: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
A_{l} & = & -U\\
B_{l} & = & \arcsin V
\end{eqnarray*}

Note, if the absolute value of $U$ is greater than $\pi$ then A and B are 
returned bad (i.e. equal to the value VAL\_\_BADD).

\subsection {The Aitoff Projection}
The Aitoff projection is an equal area projection used to produce
photometrically correct maps of the entire celestial sphere. Varying projection
parameter P(8) changes the nature of the projection because the projection
surface is not symetric about the radius vector of the celestial sphere passing
through the reference point. Again, the use of local coordinates mean that
Aitoff projections can be performed about any reference position and inclined at
any angle on the sky. 

\subsubsection {The Inverse Mapping}
The inverse mapping from local coordinates $(A_{l},B_{l})$ to $(U,V)$ 
coordinates 
(called the {\em forward} transformation in the Exp. Supp.) is defined by the
following equations, in which $r$ and $h$ are intermediate quantities equivalent
to the values labeled ``$\rho$'' and ``$\theta$'' in the Exp. Supp.: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
r & = & \arccos (\cos B_{l}.\cos (A_{l}/2) )\\
h & = & \arcsin \left(\frac {\cos B_{l}.\sin(A_{l}/2)}{\sin r}\right)\\
U & = & -4.\sin (r/2).\sin h\\
V & = & \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                 +2.\sin(r/2).\cos h   & \mbox{: if $B_{l}\geq0$}\\
                 -2.\sin(r/2).\cos h   & \mbox{: otherwise}
                \end{array}
        \right.\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsubsection {The Forward Mapping}
The forward mapping from $(U,V)$ coordinates to local coordinates 
$(A_{l},B_{l})$
( called the {\em reverse} transformation in the Exp. Supp.) is defined by
the following equations in which $\alpha$ is an intermediate quantity equivalent
to the value labeled ``$A$'' in the Exp. Supp.: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha & = & \sqrt{4-(U^{2}/4)-V^{2} }\\
B_{l} & = & \arcsin (\alpha.V/2)\\
A_{l} & = & 2.\arcsin\left(\frac{-\alpha.U}{4.\cos B_{l}}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

In above equations, values of $\alpha$ less than $\sqrt{2}$ are not allowed.
These values correspond to image pixels far from the centre of the projection.
It can be shown that the sky positions corresponding to such pixels are also
mapped by other pixels closer to the reference point (for which
$\alpha\geq\sqrt{2}$). To avoid the same part of the sky appearing twice on the
same image, the local coordinates $A_{l}$ and $B_{l}$ are both returned with the
Starlink ``BAD'' value (VAL\_\_BADD) in such cases.

\section {Changes Introduced in the Current Version of this Document}
\label {SEC:CHANGES}

Changes introduced in version 11 of ID2:
\begin{itemize}
\item New routine IRA\_ACTIVE
\end{itemize}

Changes introduced in version 10 of ID2:
Significant changes have been made in order to remove connections between
IRA identifiers and HDS. IRA identifiers now just refer to data stored
internally within common blocks. No HDS locators are stored by IRA. Therefore,
NDFs and HDS objects can be closed safely after the astrometry infromation has
been imported without losing access to the astrometry information. These 
changes have resulted in some routine being withdrawn, some new ones added, and 
some old ones now have different argument lists. 

Another significant change is that ``customised'' projections (previously
created using IRA\_CRETR) are no longer supported. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item New routines IRA\_EXPRT, IRA\_FIND, IRA\_PIXSZ and IRA\_DROPS, added.
\item Routines IRA\_CRETR, IRA\_DELET and IRA\_PROJ removed.
\item Argument lists have changed for IRA\_WRITE and IRA\_XYLIM.
\item Routines IRA\_ROT, IRA\_MOVE and IRA\_MAG no longer have any effect on the
NDF from which the astrometry information was read. A call to IRA\_EXPRT should
be made in order to store the modified astrometry information back in the NDF. 
\item The package is no longer dependant on the TRANSFORM package.
\end{enumerate}

Changes introduced in version 9 of ID2:
\begin {enumerate}
\item An eigth projection parameter has been added.
\item Routines IRA\_DROPT, IRA\_DRBRK, IRA\_DRVPO, IRA\_VALID, IRA\_MAG, 
IRA\_MOVE, IRA\_ROT, IRA\_READ and IRA\_WRITE added.
\item Argument lists of all graphics routines changed (extra graphics options 
have been introduced through the new routine IRA\_DROPT).
\item Abbreviations for GALACTIC and ECLIPTIC coordinate axes changed from
ELONG, ELAT, GLONG and GLAT to Lambda, Beta, l and b.
\item Description of the use of IRA on UNIX machines included.
\item STARLSE templates and help available for IRA subroutines.
\item The name IRA\_TRACE has been given to a new routine. There is no 
equivalent to the previous version of IRA\_TRACE.
\item Routine IRA\_SKGRD has been removed.
\item It is no longer necessary to include I90\_PAR before including
IRA\_ERR.
\item The names of symbolic constants (both errors and parameters) which previously 
were longer than five characters (excluding the IRA\_\_ prefix) have been
truncated to five characters. The actual {\em values} associated with each name 
have not changed.
\item The VMS version of IRA is now released in the form of a sharable image 
rather than an object library. Applications linked with the sharable image have 
the advantage that they will not need to be {\em re}-linked when IRA is upgraded 
in future. Note, the object library has been removed from the IRA system.
\item The linking and development procedures have been modified to bring them 
into line with Starlink standards (see SSN/8).
\item IRA is no longer directly dependant on the ARY\_ system (although it may
still have {\em in}-direct dependencies on ARY\_, for example through the
NDF\_ system).
\item Sky coordinate values formatted using style 5 are now right justified
rather than left justified as before.

\end {enumerate}

Changes introduced in version 8 of ID2:
\begin {enumerate}
\item New arguments GAPLON and GAPLAT added to IRA\_DRGRD.
\end {enumerate}

Changes introduced in version 7 of ID2:
\begin {enumerate}
\item A description of useful constants has been included in section \ref 
{SEC:CON}.
\item Sections \ref {SEC:DREX} and \ref {SEC:CHANGES} created.
\item Dependency of the graphics routines on the AGI database has been removed, 
by introducing the arguments LBND and UBND.
\item The graphics routines now have a TOL argument which enables the 
application to select the plotting accuracy (and consequently the plotting 
speed).
\item The forward mapping of the Lambert Equivalent Cylindrical projection has
been modified to return bad sky coordinate values if the supplied image position
is further than $\pi$ radians away from the reference point along the X axis
(i.e. if local coordinate $U$ has an absolute value greater than $\pi$). 
\end {enumerate}
