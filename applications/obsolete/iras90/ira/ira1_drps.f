*  Name:
*     IRA1_DRPS

*  Purpose:
*     Draw a set of parallels.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA1_DRPS( ACEN, BCEN, GAPLON, GAPLAT, SCS, IDA, IMLO, IMHI,
*                     IPLO, IPHI, LBND, UBND, MAXLAB,
*                     MAXTIC, BLAX, LABS, NLABS, TICKS, NTICKS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine draws each of the parallels in turn. 
*     Positions and directions of latitude tick marks are
*     returned, together with information about the positions of
*     latitude "end" labels (i.e. latitude labels placed at the start
*     or end of each parallel). The longest parallel is also found. If
*     end labels cannot be used (eg if a pole is in the image, or if
*     north is at a position angle of 90 degrees), then longitude labels
*     are placed on the longest parallel.

*  Arguments:
*     ACEN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The longitude of the meridian with index zero.
