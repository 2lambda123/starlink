      SUBROUTINE IRA_DRBRK( MAXBRK, OUT, BREAK, VBREAK, NBREAK, LENGTH,
     :                      STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRA_DRBRK

*  Purpose:
*     Return information about a plotted curve.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRA_DRBRK( MAXBRK, OUT, BREAK, VBREAK, NBREAK, LENGTH,
*                     STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns various items of information about the curve
*     most recently drawn using any of the routines IRA_DRGTC, IRA_DRMER
*     and IRA_DRPAR. If the graphics options LINES (see routine
*     IRA_DROPT) is set so that the drawing of curves is suppressed, the
*     information returned by this routine refers to the curve which
*     would have been drawn if LINES had been set to allow drawing of
*     curves.

*  Arguments:
*     MAXBRK = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the arguments VBREAK and BREAK. The symbolic
*        value IRA__MXBRK can be used. An error is reported if the
*        supplied arrays are too small.
*     OUT = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If .true. then the curve was completely outside the plotting
*        zone, and so no part of it could be plotted.
*     BREAK( 2, MAXBRK ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Contains the world coordinates at which each break in the
*        plotted curve occurred. These breaks may be caused by
*        discontinuities in the transformation between sky coordinates
*        and image coordinates, or simply by the fact that the curve
*        went outside the plotting window. The start and end of the
*        curve are also considered to be "breaks" even when they occur
*        within the plotting window. The exception to this is if the
*        start and end are coincident. In this case no break is recorded
*        for either the start or the end. BREAK( 1, I ) holds the X
*        world coordinate value at the I'th break, and BREAK( 2, I )
*        holds the Y world coordinate value.
*     VBREAK( 2, MAXBRK ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Contains the unit vector (within the world coordinate system)
*        parallel to the tangent to the curve at each break. The sense
*        is such that the vector always points back along the plotted
*        section of the curve.
*     NBREAK = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of breaks for which information is returned in BREAK
*        and VBREAK.
*     LENGTH = REAL (Returned)
*        The plotted length of the curve (in world coordinates).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
