      SUBROUTINE IRQ1_ALTRP( MXOPCO, MXQNAM, EXPRES, OPCODE, NOPC,
     :                       QNAMES, NQNAME, ERRPNT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ1_ALTRP

*  Purpose:
*     Convert an algebraic quality expression to a reverse polish form.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ1_ALTRP( MXOPCO, MXQNAM, EXPRES, OPCODE, NOPC, QNAMES,
*                      NQNAME, ERRPNT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The given quality expression is converted to upper case and any
*     leading blanks are removed. It is then split into "symbols", each
*     symbol being either one of the recognised logical operators (eg
*     .AND., .NOT. etc ), a logical constant (.TRUE. or .FALSE.), or
*     a quality name. A check is made that operators and operands occur
*     in the right order. Integer op.codes representing the separate
*     symbols are initially stored in the same order that they occur
*     in the quality expression. Each occurrence of a quality name is
*     replaced by a "LOAD QUALITY" op. code, and the quality name to
*     which the op. code refers is stored in the QNAMES array.
*
*     When the entire expression has been analysed as a sequence of
*     symbols (and associated constants and quality names), they are
*     sorted into "evaluation order", which is the order in which the
*     associated operations must be performed on a "First In, Last Out"
*     (FILO) stack to evaluate the expression.
*
*     If a syntax error is found which can be located within the
*     quality expression (IRQ__BADSY, IRQ__MSOPT or IRQ__MSOPD ), a
*     pointer is returned which identifies where the error occurred in
*     the returned version of the quality expression. If STATUS is not
*     returned equal to any of these three values, then ERRPNT is
*     returned zero.

*  Arguments:
*     MXOPCO = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the OPCODE array argument.
*     MXQNAM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the QNAMES array arguments.
*     EXPRES = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The quality expression. On exit, it is converted to upper case
*        and any leading blanks are removed.
*     OPCODE( MXOPCO ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The integer codes representing the operations to be performed
*        on a FILO stack in order to evaluate the quality expression.
*     NOPC = INTEGER (Returned)
*        No. of operation codes returned in array OPCODE.
*     QNAMES( MXQNAM ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The quality names referenced in the quality expression. These
*        are listed in the same order in which they are required to
*        evaluate the expression, i.e. QNAMES(1) is used by the first
*        "LOAD QUALITY" op. code stored in OPCODE; QNAMES(2) is used by
*        the second such op. code, etc.
*     NQNAME = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of quality names referenced in the quality
*        expression and returned in array QNAMES.
*     ERRPNT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The offset within the returned quality expression (EXPRES) at
*        which certain errors were detected. These errors have
*        associated STATUS values IRQ__BADSY ("Unrecognised logical
*        operator or constant"), IRQ__MSOPT ("Missing operator") and
*        IRQ__MSOPD ("Missing operand"). ERRPNT is returned zero if none
*        of these errors are found.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
