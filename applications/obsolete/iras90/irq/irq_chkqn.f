      SUBROUTINE IRQ_CHKQN( LOCS, QNAME, THERE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRQ_CHKQN

*  Purpose:
*     Check a specified quality name to see if it is defined.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRQ_CHKQN( LOCS, QNAME, THERE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine searches for a specified quality name in the quality
*     name specified by LOCS. If it is found, THERE is returned true.
*     Otherwise THERE is returned false.

*  Arguments:
*     LOCS(5) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An array of 5 HDS locators. These locators identify the NDF
*        and the associated quality name information.  They should have
*        been obtained using routine IRQ_FIND or routine IRQ_NEW.
*     QNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The quality name to search for. Leading blanks are ignored and
*        the search is case-insensitive. The maximum allowed length for
*        quality names is given by symbolic constant IRQ__SZQNM which
*        currently has the value of 15.
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true, then the quality name is defined within the NDF
*        specified by LOCS. If false, then the quality name is
*        undefined.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

                                 ! quality names information.
      INTEGER LAST               ! Position of last non-blank character.
      CHARACTER LQNAME*(IRQ__SZQNM) ! Upper case copy of quality name.
      INTEGER SLOT               ! Slot at which the name was stored.
*.

*  Check inherited global status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  Obtain the NDF identifier from LOCS, and check it is still valid.
      CALL IRQ1_INDF( LOCS, INDF, STATUS )

*  Produce an uppercase copy of the supplied quality name, exluding
*  leading blanks.
      CALL CHR_FANDL( QNAME, FIRST, LAST )
      LQNAME = QNAME( FIRST : LAST )
      CALL CHR_UCASE( LQNAME )

*  Check the requested quality name.
      CALL IRQ1_CHECK( LOCS, LQNAME( : LAST - FIRST + 1 ), THERE,
