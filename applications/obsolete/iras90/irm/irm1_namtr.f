      SUBROUTINE IRM1_NAMTR( KMD, INSTR, OUTSTR, J )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRM1_NAMTR

*  Purpose:
*     Translate help library names.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM1_NAMTR( KMD, INSTR, OUTSTR, J )

*  Description:
*     This routine provides the service of the NAMETR subroutine
*     required when calling HLP_HELP (see SUN/124). It checks to see
*     if the supplied string starts with a logical name or environment
*     variable. If it does, the reference is replaced by the value
*     in the returned string. Otherwise, the string is left unaltered.

*  Arguments:
*     KMD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The function flag. Ignored by this routine.
*     INSTR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The supplied help library name.
*     OUTSTR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The help library name with logical name or environment
*        variable references replaced by their value.
*     J = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Status. Always returned equal to 0.

*  Find the start and end of the supplied string.
      CALL CHR_FANDL( INSTR, START, END )

*  Initialise the variable name to blank.

*  variable name and find the first occurence of a / character.
