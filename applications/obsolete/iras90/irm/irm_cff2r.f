*  Name:
*     IRM_CFF2R

*  Purpose:
*     Rejects iteratively defects in a substantially smooth 2-d array. 

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM_CFF2R( NX, NY, INARR, VAR, NVAR, INVAR, BOXSZ, NITER,
*                     CLIP, LIMITS, ILEVEL, SAMBAD, NLIM, CINARR,
*                     OUTARR, OUTVAR, NGOOD, SIGMA, ASUM, NSUM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine sets pixels in a 2-d array to be invalid if they
*     deviate too far from 'local mean' and lie within a nominated
*     range of values.  The local mean is obtained by a rectangular
*     neighbourhood block-average smooth of the input array.  An
*     iterative procedure is followed where the cleaned array becomes
*     the new array to be cleaned at another threshold, and is itself
*     smoothed to find whether its pixels deviate from their smoothed
*     counterparts. A pixel that does deviate is set to the bad value,
*     as is its variance. Otherwise the pixel and variance are
*     propagated to the cleaned array.  Iterations stop and status is
*     set to SAI__ERROR when the array is entirely composed of bad
*     values or all pixels have been rejected.

*  Arguments:
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension of the image to be cleaned.
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second dimension of the image to be cleaned.
*     INARR( NX * NY ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input array containing the image from which the pixels 
*        with large deviation will be rejected.
*     VAR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        The state of the variance component of the input NDF.  If the
*        variance component exists it is true.
*     NVAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements of the variance array.
*     INVAR( NVAR ) = REAL (Given)
*        The variance array of the input array to be cleaned.  If the
*        variance is present the dimensions should be NX by NY, as for
*        the data arrays.
*     BOXSZ( 2 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of smoothing box in pixels.
*     NITER = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of iterations in the rejection algorithm.
*     CLIP( NITER ) = REAL (Given)
*        The maximum number of standard deviations for the rejection
*        threshold at each iteration.
*     LIMITS( 2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The thresholds outside which any pixel data value will not be
*        cleaned. The order is not important.
*     ILEVEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The interaction level.  If it is greater than one, the
*        intermediate result of each iteration will be reported to the
*        user.
*     SAMBAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If a .TRUE. value is given for this argument, then bad input
*        pixels will be propagated to the output image unchanged during
*        smoothing (a smoothed output value will be calculated for all
*        other pixels). If a .FALSE. value is given, then the NLIM
*        argument determines whether an output pixel is good or bad.
*        The value of NLIM is not relevant if SAMBAD is .TRUE.
*     NLIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Minimum number of good pixels which must be present in the
*        smoothing box in order to calculate a smoothed output pixel.
*        If this minimum number is not satisfied, then a bad output
*        pixel will result. A value between 1 and the total number of
*        pixels in the smoothing box should be supplied.
*     CINARR( NX * NY ) = REAL (Given)
*        Work array for containing the latest cleaned iteration,
*        initially the input array to be supplied to the local-mean 
*        routine.  Thus on exit it contains the cleaned image before the
*        last iteration.
*     OUTARR( NX * NY ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The output array to contain the processed image.
*     OUTVAR( NVAR ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The variance of the output array.
*     NGOOD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The valid pixels in the output array. If input array has no 
*        valid pixel at all, it will be set to -1.
*     SIGMA = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The estimate of the RMS noise per pixel in the output image.
*     ASUM( NX ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work array for pixel sums during smoothing the image.
*     NSUM( NX ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Work array for counting good pixels during smoothing the image.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
