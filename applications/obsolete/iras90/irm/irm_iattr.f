      SUBROUTINE IRM_IATTR( ITEM, CURVE, IVAL, LVAL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRM_IATTR

*  Purpose:
*     Get an item of graphical information from IRM common blocks.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM_IATTR( ITEM, CURVE, IVAL, LVAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Various IRM routines (written by Wei Gong) allow attributes of an
*     NCAR plot to be set up (eg colour, dashed line pattern, etc).
*     These routines store items of information in internal IRM common
*     blocks. However, NCAR applications such as TRACECRDD need to get
*     at these values stored in common. It is bad practice for an
*     application to attempt to directly access common blocks declared
*     internally within a (supposedly) independent subroutine package,
*     as it means that the implementation of IRM cannot be changed
*     without also changing the applications.  Also, IRM is usually
*     distributed in a sharable form, which makes it difficult for
*     applications to access its internal common blocks.
*     
*     This routine gets round these problems by providing a subroutine
*     interface for accessing these common values.

*  Arguments:
*     ITEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The attribute required. These are listed in the "Notes:"
*        section below.
*     CURVE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The curve to which the returned value should refer. An error
*        is reported if this is out of bounds (1 to the value of the
*        NCURV attribute). It is ignored if the item does not have a
*        separate value for each curve.
*     IVAL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The value of an integer-type attribute. The data type of each
*        attribute is listed in the "Notes:" section below.
*     LVAL = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        The value of an logical-type attribute.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  MXCURV: Maximum no. of curves (_INTEGER).
*     -  OLDPX: Original GKS polyline colour index (_INTEGER).
*     -  OLDTX: Original GKS polyline text index (_INTEGER).
*     -  SOCUR: True if polylines are drawn solid (_LOGICAL).
*     -  NCURV: The no. of curves with defined attributes. The
*     argument CURVE must be supplied with a value no greater than
*     NCURV.
*     -  CRPN: Pen number for each curve. (_INTEGER)   
*     -  INCL: Colour indices of the in-line labels for each curve. (_INTEGER)
*     -  AXPN: Pen number of axis lines (_INTEGER)
*     -  TKPN: Pen number of tick marks (_INTEGER)
*     -  NLBCL: Colour index of numeric labels. (_INTEGER)
*     -  TITCL: Colour indices of title. (_INTEGER)
*     -  ALBCL: Colour indices of axes labels. (_INTEGER)
*     -  STDAT: True if values have already been assigned for these
*     attributes. (_LOGICAL)
