      SUBROUTINE IRM1_SREAD( LU, V1, V2, V3, JSTAT)
*+
*  Name:
*     IRM1_SREAD

*  Purpose:
*     Read, condition, paraphrase and classify a string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM1_SREAD( SREAD (LU, V1, V2, V3, JSTAT)

*  Description:
*     A string is input from the nominated I/O unit LU (in A format)
*     and, unless end-of-file was detected, three versions of it are
*     created.
*
*     Version 1 (V1) is as input except that spaces replace any
*     non-printing characters (e.g. TABs).
*
*     Version 2 (V2) is the same as version 1 except that any leading
*     spaces or trailing comments are removed.
*
*     Version 3 (V3) is the same as version 2 except that outside
*     "string arguments", lowercase is converted to uppercase.

*  Arguments:
*     LU = INTEGER (Given)
*        I/O unit for input.
*     V1 = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        String with TABS etc eliminated.
*     V2 = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        String left justified and without comments.
*     V3 = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        String converted to upper case.
*     JSTAT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Status:  -1 = end-of-file, 0 = not a comment, +1 = comment
*        Note, this status value is not an inherited status.

*  Notes:
*     -  "String arguments" are groups of characters enclosed by
*      pairs of either single or double quotes.  The contents
*      are protected against conversion to uppercase.  The delimiters
*      are ultimately removed by means of the GETSTR routine.
*     -  A '!' character is only interpreted as start of comment
*      if it is not within a string argument.
*     -  If end-of-file is detected, spaces are returned for V1,
*      V2 and V3.
*     -  The algorithm uses several characters which are outside
*      the ANSI FORTRAN 77 set (exclamation point, double quote,
*      tilde, lowercase).  Different machine types may need a
*      rewrite.
*     -  This subprogram was suggested by the RDNEXT routine of
*      Russell Owen (UW/ARC).

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER LU

*  Arguments Returned:
      CHARACTER V1*(*)
      CHARACTER V2*(*)
      CHARACTER V3*(*)
      INTEGER JSTAT

*  Local Variables:
      CHARACTER C*1
      CHARACTER CDELIM*1         ! Current string argument delimiter
                                 ! character.
      LOGICAL COMENT             ! True if a comment has started.

*  Obtain the string lengths
      L1 = LEN( V1 )
      L2 = LEN( V2 )

*  Initialise second pointer
      I2 = 0

*  Preset the first two strings to spaces
      V1 = ' '
      V2 = ' '

*  Reset the "string argument has started" flag
      CDELIM = ' '

*  Reset the "comment has started" flag
      COMENT = .FALSE.

*  Preset the status to EOF
      JSTAT = -1

*  Read the string
      READ( LU, '(A)', END=999 ) V1

*  Not EOF:  preset the status to "comment"
      JSTAT = 1

*  Step along the raw input string
      DO I1 = 1, L1

*  Next character
         C = V1( I1 : I1 )

*  Replace non-printing characters with spaces
         IF( C .LT. ' ' .OR. C .GT. '~' ) C = ' '

*  "String argument" delimiter character?
         IF( .NOT. COMENT .AND.

*  Store character in first string

*  Start of comment?

*  Are we within a comment?
         IF( .NOT. COMENT ) THEN

*  No:  leading space?
            IF( I2 .NE. 0 .OR. C .NE. ' ' ) THEN

*  No:  reset "comment" flag

*  Store character in string 2 unless already filled
