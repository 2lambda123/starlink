      SUBROUTINE IRM_STPEN( NCURV, CURPEN, SOLID, INLPEN, AXSPEN,
     :                      TCKPEN, NLBPEN, ALBPEN, TITPEN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRM_STPEN

*  Purpose:
*     Set pen number various portions of an NCAR display.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM_STPEN( NCURV, CURPEN, SOLID, INLPEN, AXSPEN,
*                     TCKPEN, NLBPEN, ALBPEN, TITPEN, STATUS )
*  Description:
*     The routine is used, together with a user version of AGCHCU,
*     AGCHAX and AGCHIL to set the pen number for each curve, axis
*     lines, tick marks, numeric labels, axis labels and title of
*     an NCAR display. Since AGCHCU, AGCHAX and AGCHIL can not be
*     called by user program directly, the user program has to call
*     this routine to set the pen number before NCAR's drawing. The
*     routine will save the pen number setting in a common block
*     which will be accessed by the new AGCHCU, AGCHAX and AGCHIL
*     to set the pen number when each portion is about to be drawn.
*
*     The title referred to is the title written by NCAR (AUTOGRAPH)
*     routines EZY, EZMY etc. which have the name of 'T' and line
*     number of 100. The axis labels have the name either 'T' or
*     'B' or 'R' or 'L'.
*
*     To make this routine take effect, the user program must be
*     linked with the new version of AGCHCU, AGCHAX and AGCHIL
*     explicitly instead of the default ones in NCAR library.
*
*  Prior Requirements:
*     Before calling this routine, a SGS graphic device must have been
*     opened.
*
*     The following settings of the GKS ASF flag are assumed (they are
*     SGS initial settings ):
*         POLYLINE - bundled
*         TEXT - individual

*
*  Arguments:
*     NCURV = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of curves
*     CURPEN( NCURV ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The SGS pen number for each curve.
*     SOLID = LOGICAL (Given)
*        The flag to show whether to draw the curves in the solid line
*        regardless of the pen number of the curves.  If it is true the
*        curves in the plot will all be solid regardless of their pen
*        number and graphic device, otherwise, the line types of the
*        the curves depends on both their pen number and the graphic
*        device type.
*     INLPEN( NCURV ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The SGS pen number for each in-line label.
*     AXSPEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The pen number for the axis lines.
*     TCKPEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The pen number for the tick marks.
*     NLBPEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The pen number for the numeric labels.
*     ALBPEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The pen number for the axis labels.
*     TITPEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The pen number for the title of the display.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
