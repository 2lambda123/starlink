      SUBROUTINE IRM_HMULT( IN1, IN2, M, N, OUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRM_HMULT

*  Purpose:
*     Multiply two Hermitian images.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM_HMULT( IN1, IN2, M, N, OUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Each input Hermitian image represents a COMPLEX image in which
*     certain symetries exist. These symetries allow all the
*     information stored in the COMPLEX image to be compressed into a
*     single REAL image. This routine effectively unpacks the two REAL
*     images given as input into two COMPLEX images, multiplies them
*     together pixel-by-pixel to produce another COMPLEX image, and
*     then packs the COMPLEX image back into a single Hermitian REAL
*     image. In fact it is not necessary to do the actual unpacking and
*     packing of these Hermitian images; this algorithm generates the
*     output Hermitian image directly and thus saves time.
*
*     NB, to make this routine consistent with the routines RLFFT and
*     HMFFT which also handle Hermitian images, the input and output
*     Hermitian images are all defined to be in "transposed" form, in
*     which the rows and columns are reversed from their normal form.
*     Thus the first array index is in what is normally called the
*     "line" direction and the second is in the "pixel" direction.
*
*     Each of the supplied FFTs can be thought of as being derived as
*     follows (see the NAG manual, introduction to chapter C06 for more
*     information on the storage of Hermitian FFTs):
*
*  1) Take the one-dimensional FFT of each row of the original image.
*  2) Stack all these one-dimensional FFTs into a pair of 2D images
*     the same size as the original image. One 2D image ("A") holds the
*     real part and the other ("B") holds the imaginary part. Each row
*     of image A will have symetry such that A(J,row) = A(M-J,row) (J
*     goes from 0 to M-1), while each row of image B will have symetry
*     such that B(J,row) = -B(M-J,row).
*  3) Take the one-dimensional FFT of each column of image A.
*  4) Stack all these one-dimensional FFTs into a pair of 2D images,
*     image AA holds the real part of each FFT, and image BA holds the
*     imaginary part. Each column of AA will have symetry such that
*     AA(column,K) = AA(column,N-K) (K goes from 0 to N-1), each column
*     of BA will have symetry such that BA(column,K) = -BA(column,N-K).
*  4) Take the one-dimensional FFT of each column of image B.
*  5) Stack all these one-dimensional FFTs into a pair of 2D images,
*     image AB holds the real part of each FFT, and image BB holds the
*     imaginary part. Each column of AB will have symetry such that
*     AB(column,K) = AB(column,N-K) (K goes from 0 to N), each column of
*     BB will have symetry such that BB(column,K) = -BB(column,N-K).
*  6) The resulting 4 images all have either positive or negative
*     symetry in both axes. The Hermitian FFT images supplied to this
*     routine are made up of one quadrant from each image. The bottom
*     left quadrant is taken from AA, the bottom right quadrant is taken
*     from AB, the top left quadrant is taken from BA and the top right
*     quadrant is taken from BB. 
*
*     The product of two hermitian FFTs is itself Hermitian and so can
*     be described in a similar manner. If the first input FFT
*     corresponds to the four images AA1, AB1, BA1 and BB1, and the
*     second input FFt corresponds to the four images AA2, AB2, BA2,
*     BB2, then the output is described by the four images AA, AB, BA
*     and BB where:
*
*     AA =  AA1*AA2 + BB1*BB2 - BA1*BA2 - AB1*AB2
*     BB =  AA1*BB2 + BB1*AA2 + BA1*AB2 + AB1*BA2
*     BA =  BA1*AA2 - AB1*BB2 + AA1*BA2 - BB1*AB2
*     AB = -BA1*BB2 + AB1*AA2 + AA1*AB2 - BB1*BA1

*  Arguments:
*     IN1( N, M ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The first input transposed Hermitian image.
*     IN2( N, M ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The first input transposed Hermitian image.

*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        No. of lines in the non-transposed image from which the
*        Hermitian images were created.
*     OUT( N, M ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The product of the two input images, in transposed Hermitian
*        form.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
