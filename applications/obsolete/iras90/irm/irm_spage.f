*  Purpose:
*     See if paged screen output is currently enabled.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM_SPAGE( ON )

*  Description:
*     Routine IRM_PTOUT produces paged output on the screen. Such

*     string when asked to "Press RETURN to continue". This routine
*     returns a flag indicating if output is currently enabled or
*     suppressed.

*  Arguments:

*        True if text passed to IRM_PTOUT will actually appear on the
