      SUBROUTINE IRM_READF( PARAM, REJECT, IGRP, SIZE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRM_READF

*  Purpose:
*     Read the contents of a text file into a GRP group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM_READF( PARAM, REJECT, IGRP, SIZE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied parameter is used to obtain the name of a text file
*     from the environment. The contents of this text file are read and 
*     stored in a GRP group. The default GRP control characters are used
*     to interpret the contents of the file. For instance, this means 
*     that fields separated by commas are placed in adjacent elements 
*     of the group, strings starting with # are ignored as comments, 
*     strings starting with ^ are treated as indirection elements, etc.
*     If REJECT is supplied .TRUE., all blanks elements are removed from
*     the group before it is returned. The group is set 
*     case-insensitive.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The name of the parameter used to get the name of the text 
*        file.
*     REJECT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, blanks are removed from the group.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The GRP identifier for the returned group.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of elements in the returned group.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
