*  Name:
*     IRM_CLEAN

*  Purpose:
*     Clean a one dimensional data array by removing bright sources.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM_CLEAN( LBND, UBND, DATIN, LBNDW, UBNDW, HBOX, NITER,
*                     NSIGMA, DATOUT, RMS, WORK1, WORK2, WORK3, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The output data is a copy of the input data except that bright 
*     sources are replaced by bad values.
*
*     The input data is smoothed with a box filter of given width, and
*     the residuals between the smoothed data and the original data are
*     found. The RMS residual is then found and data values are set bad
*     if they differ from the smoothed data values by more than a
*     specified multiple of the RMS residual. The process is then
*     repeated NITER times. An error is reported if all the data is bad
*     on entry  or if all the data is removed by the cleaning algorithm.

*  Arguments:
*     LBND = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bound of the data.
*     UBND = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bound of the data.
*     DATIN( LBND : UBND ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input data.
*     LBNDW = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bound of the work arrays. This should be equal to
*        LBND - HBOX - 1.
*     UBNDW = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bound of the work arrays. This should be equal to
*        UBND + HBOX.
*     HBOX = INTEGER (Given)
*        Half the width of the smoothing box. The full size is
*        2*HBOX+1.
*     NITER = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of cleaning iterations to perform.
*     NSIGMA = REAL (Given)
*        The multiple of the RMS residual at which points will be
*        rejected.
*     DATOUT( LBND : UBND ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The cleaned data.
*     RMS = REAL (Returned)
*        An estimate of the standard deviation of the noise in the input
*        data.
*     WORK1( LBNDW : UBNDW ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     WORK2( LBNDW : UBNDW ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     WORK3( LBNDW : UBNDW ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
