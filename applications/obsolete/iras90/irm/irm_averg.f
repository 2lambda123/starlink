      SUBROUTINE IRM_AVERG( NSMP, DATA, THRD, NITRN, AVG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRM_AVERG

*  Purpose:
*     Estimate the average of a data series.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM_AVERG(  NSMP, DATA, THRD, NITRN, AVG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine estimates the average of a data series by
*     iteratively calculating the average of the data series with the 
*     data samples which are too far away from the current data average 
*     being excluded. The samples whose distances from the current data
*     average are more than THRD * (Current standard deviation ) will 
*     be regarded as too far from the current average and will be 
*     excluded from the next iteration to calculate the new average and 
*     standard deviation. This procedure will be repeated until the 
*     successive standard deviations are the same or specified iteration
*     number (NITRN) is rearched.

*  Arguments:
*     NSMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of samples in the input data series.
*     DATA( NSMP ) = REAL (Given)
*        The inut data series.
*     THRD = REAL (Given)
*        The multiple of the standard deviation. Samples will not be
*        included in the calculation of the average and standart 
*        deviation of the next iteration if they are more than this 
*        multiple away from the current average.
*     NITRN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Max. number of iterations at which the standard deviation will
*        be returned as the estimated noise no matter the convergence
*        has achieved. 
*     AVG = REAL (Returned)
*        The average of the data series.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
