*  Name:

*  Purpose:
*     Compute simple statistics for an array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRM1_STATR( BAD, EL, DATA, NCLIP, CLIP, NGOOD, IMIN, DMIN,
*                      IMAX, DMAX, SUM, MEAN, STDEV, NGOODC, IMINC,

*  Description:
*     This routine computes simple statistics for an array, namely: the
*     number of valid pixels, the minimum and maximum pixel values (and
*     their positions), the pixel sum, the mean, and the standard
*     deviation. Iterative K-sigma clipping may also be optionally
*     applied.

*  Arguments:
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether checks for bad pixels should be performed on the array
*        being analysed.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels in the array.
*     DATA( EL ) = ? (Given)
*        Array to be analysed.
*     NCLIP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of K-sigma clipping iterations to apply (may be zero).
*     CLIP( NCLIP ) = REAL (Given)
*        Array of clipping limits for successive iterations, expressed
*        as standard deviations.
*     NGOOD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of valid pixels in the array before clipping.
*     IMIN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Index where the pixel with the lowest value was (first) found
*        before clipping.
*     DMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Minimum pixel value in the array before clipping.
*     IMAX = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Index where the pixel with the highest value was (first) found
*        before clipping.
*     DMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Maximum pixel value in the array before clipping.
*     SUM = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Sum of the valid pixels before clipping.
*     MEAN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Mean of the valid pixels before clipping.
*     STDEV = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Standard deviation of the valid pixels before clipping.
*     NGOODC = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of valid pixels in the array after clipping.
*     IMINC = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Index where the pixel with the lowest value was (first) found
*        after clipping.
*     DMINC = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Minimum pixel value in the array after clipping.
*     IMAXC = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Index where the pixel with the highest value was (first) found
*        after clipping.
*     DMAXC = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Maximum pixel value in the array after clipping.
*     SUMC = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Sum of the valid pixels after clipping.
*     MEANC = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Mean of the valid pixels after clipping.
*     STDEVC = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Standard deviation of the valid pixels after clipping.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each of the standard numeric types.
*     Replace "x" in the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as
*     appropriate. The data type of the array being analysed must match
*     the particular routine used.
*     -  If no clipping is performed (i.e. if NCLIP = 0) then the values
*     of arguments which return results after clipping will be the same
*     as for those returning results before clipping.
*     -  If NGOOD or NGOODC is zero, then the values of all the derived
*     statistics will be undefined and will be set to the "bad" value
*     appropriate to their data type (except for the pixel sum, which
*     will be zero).
