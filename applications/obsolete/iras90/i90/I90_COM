*  Name:
*     I90_COM

*  Purpose:
*     Declare arrays and common blocks used to store constants relating
*     to the IRAS satellite and mission.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     This include file declares arrays used to store constants
*     relating to the IRAS satellite and mission, and also declares the
*     common blocks which hold these arrays. It does not assign values
*     to the arrays; the BLOCK DATA module I90_INIT is used to set up
*     the contents of the arrays.  Scalar parameters relating to the
*     IRAS satellite or mission are defined within include file
*     I90_PAR. Both arrays and scalars are made available to
*     applications by including the file I90_DAT.
*
*     Note, the file I90_PAR must be included before this module.
