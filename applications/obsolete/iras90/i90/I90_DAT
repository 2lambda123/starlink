*  Name:
*     I90_DAT

*  Purpose:
*     Declare and initialise constants (both scalars and arrays)
*     relating to the IRAS satellite and mission.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     This module should be included by any application which wishes to
*     access any of the "I90__" constants and variables which hold
*     values related to the IRAS satellite and mission. See the "Notes"
*     section for the constants which are defined by inclusion of this
*     module.
*
*     Applications which include this module must be linked with the
*     object module I90_INIT.

*

*     1 to I90__NDEAD.
*
*     -  I90__DETGP( I90__DETS )

*     number (1-4).

*     -  I90__XDETS( I90__DETS )
*     Detectors in cross scan order regardless of their band. First
*     index is cross scan order, i.e. element 1 stores the detector
*     number for the detector with largest focal plane Z coordinate,
*     etc.
*
*     -  I90__BANDW( I90__BANDS )

*     Mean Noise Equivalent Flux Density in each waveband in Jy, from
*     Exp. Supp. Fig.  IV.A.1. First index is IRAS waveband number
*     (1-4).
*
*     -  I90__DETDY( I90__DETS )
*     In-scan detector mask sizes in arcmins (Exp. Supp. table II.C.3).
*     The first index is detector number.
*
*     -  I90__DETDZ( I90__DETS )
*     Cross-scan detector mask sizes in arcmins (Exp.  Supp. table
*     II.C.3). The first index is detector number.
*
*     -  I90__DETY( I90__DETS )
*     Focal plane Y value at detector centres (Exp. Supp.  table
*     II.C.3). The first index is detector number.
*
*     -  I90__DETZ( I90__DETS )
*     Focal plane Z value at detector centres (Exp.  Supp.  table
*     II.C.3). The first index is detector number.
*
*     -  I90__DNEFD( I90__DETS )
*     Noise Equivalent  Flux Density for each detector (Jy), from Exp.
*     Supp. Fig IV.A.1 ). The first index is detector number.
*
*     -  I90__DY( I90__BANDS )
*     In-scan size of detectors in each band, in arcminutes.First index

*     Effective solid angle of each detector in units of 1.0E-7 of a
*     steradians. Calculated by M.  Moshir (see IPAC memo 701-88-54
*     (1)). Dead detectors have a value of zero. The first index is
*     detector number.
