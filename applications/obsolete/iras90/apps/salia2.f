      SUBROUTINE SALIA2( LBND1, UBND1, IDA1, IDAR, SCS, LBND2, UBND2,
     :                   STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SALIA2

*  Purpose:
*     Find default bounds for the output image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SALIA2( LBND1, UBND1, IDA1, IDAR, SCS, LBND2, UBND2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A grid of test points is transformed from the input image
*     coordinate system to the output image coordinate system and the
*     bounds of this grid in the output image are returned.
*     Complications arise because the grid of test points may not fully
*     sample the output image. Just transforming positions on the edge
*     of the input image is not good enough because some projections may
*     cause the inside of the input image to be mapped outside its
*     boundary (eg a gnomonic input image covering a polar region
*     mapped to an Aitoff output image). For this reason succesively
*     finer grids are used which cover the entire input image, until
*     the output bounds stabalise.
*
*     A grid of test points is defined in the input image. This grid
*     initially consists of just the four corners of the input image.
*     The grid is transformed into sky coordinates using the astrometry
*     information read from the input image, and then to output image
*     coordinates using the reference astrometry information. The range
*     of column and row numbers covered by the transformed points are
*     found. The process is then repeated using a finer grid. Each
*     section of the grid is divided into two (thus the 2x2 array of
*     test points becomes a 3x3 array), and the corresponding area of
*     the output image is found. If the second estimate is more than
*     10% larger than the first (or if there were insufficient good
*     positions in the grid to evaluate the output bounds), then the
*     process is repeated again with a finer grid. The shape of the
*     array of grid points goes through the values 2x2, 3x3, 5x5, 9x9,
*     etc, up to a maximum of 65x65. An error is reported if the output
*     bounds are still increasing when the maximum grid size is
*     reached.

*  Arguments:
*     LBND1( 2 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bounds of the input NDF.
*     UBND1( 2 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bounds of the input NDF.

*     IDAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        An IRA identifier for the reference (output) astrometry

*        The sky coordinate system used by the reference astrometry
*        information.
*     LBND2( 2 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The lower bounds of the output NDF.
