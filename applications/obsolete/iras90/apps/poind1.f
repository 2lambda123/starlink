*  Name:
*     POIND1

*  Purpose:
*     Re-sample the specified profile.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POIND1( NPSMP, NPROF, DATA, AXIS, BAND, PRFWID, PRFSEG,
*                  STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine re-samples a segment of the point source profile
*     associated with the given waveband in the same rate as the IRAS
*     scans. The segment to be re-sampled is centred at the profile
*     centre, which has the zero X axis value, and has the length of
*     PRFWID. 

*  Arguments:
*     NPSMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of samples in the input ideal point source profile data
*        array.
*     NPROF = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of profile in the input ideal point source profile data
*        array.
*     DATA( NPSMP, NPROF ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input ideal point source profile data array. 
*     AXIS( NPSMP ) = REAL (Given)
*        The in-scan axis of the point source profile, in arc-min from
*        its centre.
*     BAND = INTEGER (Given)
*        Waveband number with which associated point source profile is
*        to be resampled.
*     PRFWID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of the samples in the resampled non-zero segment of
*        the profile.
*     PRFSEG( PRFWID ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The resampled non-zero segment of the selected profile.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
