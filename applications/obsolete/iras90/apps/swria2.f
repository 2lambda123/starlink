*  Name:
*     SWRIA2

*  Purpose:
*     Write text string interactively.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SWRIA2( PTXT, PLON, PLAT, MODE, IRA, SCS, X1, X2, Y1, Y2,
*                  MXNTXT, NTXT, LON, LAT, TXT, DIRX, DIRY, HIGT, RTIO,
*                  JSTF, SPAC, FONT, PEN, STATUS ) 

*  Description:
*     This subroutine is used by applicaition SKYWRITE to write text
*     string in the current SGS zone interactively. The positions of
*     texts to be written to are either specified by the cursor or by
*     their sky coordinates specified via the keyboard. The subroutine
*     will keep prompting the user for the specification of the next
*     text until a null. '!' response is obtained or the position
*     specified by the cursor is outside the zone. The positions,
*     texts and their attributes are retruned in arrays. 

*  Arguments:
*     PTXT = CHARACTER (Given)
*        The name of the parameter used to get the text string to be
*        written to the image.
*     PLON = CHARACTER (Given)
*        The name of the parameter used to get the longitude of the
*        position at which the text is to be written.
*     PLAT = CHARACTER (Given)
*        The name of the parameter used to get the latitude of the
*        position at which the text is to be written.
*     MODE = CHARACTER (Given)
*        Application's working mode. It can be either 'KEYBOARD', the
*        position should be specified via keyboard, or 'CURSOR', the
*        position should be specified by cursor.
*     IRA = INTEGER (Given)
*        The id of the IRA system.
*     SCS = CHARACTER (Given)
*        The name of the sky coordinate system in use.
*     X1, X2, Y1, Y2 = REAL (Given)
*        Extension of the current SGS zone.
*     MXNTXT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The max. number of text string can be written to the image.
*     NTXT = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Number of text strings have been written to the image.
*     LON( MXNTXT ), LAT( MXNTXT ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Longitude and latitude of the positions at which texts has been
*        written.
*     TXT( MXNTXT ) = CHARACTER (Given and Returned)
*        The text strings have been written to the image so far.
*     DIRX( MXNTXT ), DIRY( MXNTXT ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The up directions of the texts have been written so far.
*     HIGT( MXNTXT ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The heights of the texts have been written so far.
*     RTIO( MXNTXT ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The aspect ratio of the texts have been written so far.
*     JSTF( MXNTXT ) = CHARACTER (Given and Returned)
*        The justifications of the texts have been written so far.
*     SPAC( MXNTXT ) = CHARACTER (Given and Returned)
*        The space of the characters in the texts have been written so
*        far.
*     FONT( MXNTXT ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The fonts of the texts have been written so far.
*     PEN( MXNTXT ) INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The pen of the texts have been written so far.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
