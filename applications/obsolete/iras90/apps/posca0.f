*  Description:
*     Information about the supplied CRDD file is stored in the work
*     array. Each row of the work array holds a different item of
*     information:
*
*     WORK( *, 1 ) = Index of CRDD file within the input group.
*     WORK( *, 2 ) = Minimum cross-scan distance from required position
*                    to the boresight track, in arc-mins.
*     WORK( *, 3 ) = In-scan distance between required position and the
*                    CRDD file reference position, in arc-mins.
*     WORK( *, 4 ) = Sample number at which the detector given by row 5
*                    reaches its closest point of approach to the
*                    required position.
*     WORK( *, 5 ) = The number of the detector which passes closest to
*                    the required position.
*     WORK( *, 6 ) = The position angle of the boresight track at the
*                    sample given by row 4.
*     WORK( *, 7 ) = SOP
*     WORK( *, 8 ) = OBS
*
*     If an error occurs, all values are returned equal to the bad 
*     value VAL__BADD.

*        DEC (B1950) of required position.
*     NCRDDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        No. of NDFs in the input group.
*     NITEM = INTEGER (Given)
*        No. of items of information stored about each CRDD file.
*     WORK( NCRDDF, NITEM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
