*  Name:
*     MAPCC5

*  Purpose:
*     To create a set of pixel weight grids.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MAPCC5( C2, NZSECT, NYSECT, SECWGT, NX, NY, C3, PWGSZX,
*                  PWGSZY, RLO, RHI, PLO, PHI, IPPWG, GCXIND, GCYIND,
*                  STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The weights to use for each pixel depend on the relative position
*     of the detector centre within the central pixel. A set of pixel
*     weight grids is created for a range of different relative
*     positions. The central pixel is divided up into NX by NY equal
*     segments, and a weights grid is produced with the detector centre
*     coincident with the centre of each segment. Each grid is produced
*     by mapping the supplied sector (sectors and segments are
*     different) weights array into the pixel weights gridded. Because
*     the sectors are much smaller than the pixels, each pixel weight
*     will in general be made up by summing several sector weights
*     together. The sector weights have a total sum of unity, and
*     therefore each pixel weight grid will also have a total sum of
*     unity.

*  Arguments:
*     C2( 6 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The coefficients of the linear transformation from sector
*        indices to focal plane offsets from the detector centre.
*     NZSECT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of sector in the cross-scan direction across a full
*        size detector.
*     NYSECT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of sector in the in-scan direction across a full
*        size detector.
*     SECWGT( NZSECT, NYSECT ) = REAL (Given)
*        The array of sector weights, normalized to a sum of unity.
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of segments into which to divide the range in X
*        coordinate covered by the pixel containing the detector
*        centre.
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of segments into which to divide the range in Y
*        coordinate covered by the pixel containing the detector
*        centre.
*     C3( 6 ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        On entry, C3 holds the coefficients of the linear
*        transformation from focal plane offsets from the detector
*        centre, to pixel coordinates in the output map. Elements
*        ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) are changed by this routine.
*     PWGSZX = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The size of the first dimension of each pixel weight grid. If
*        the supplied values of PWGSZX and PWGSZY are not large enough
*        to contain all the non-zero pixel weight, then the values are
*        increased and extra dynamic memory is allocated to store the
*        larger pixel grids.
*     PWGSZY = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The size of the second dimension of each pixel weight grid
*        (see PWGSZX).
*     RLO = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower row bound of the region of the grids containing
*        non-zero weights. Grid pixels outside the area supplied by
*        RLO, RHI, PLO and PHI on entry are assumed to be zero.
*     RHI = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper row bound of the region of the grids containing
*        non-zero weights.
*     PLO = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The lower pixel bound of the region of the grids containing
*        non-zero weights.
*     PHI = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The upper pixel bound of the region of the grids containing
*        non-zero weights.
*     IPPWG( NX, NY ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Pointers to the NX by NY pixel weight grids.
*     GCXIND = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The X index of the grid pixel containing the detector centre.
*     GCYIND = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The Y index of the grid pixel containing the detector centre.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
