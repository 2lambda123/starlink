*  Name:
*     POINA6

*  Purpose:
*     To calculate the mean and variance of a set of samples, the
*     calculation takes place iteratively rejecting any samples
*     which are outside THSD * previous iteration standard deviation
*     from the mean. 

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POINA6( EXTEND, INSMPL, INSMPU, MINSMP, OUTSMP, 
*                  SINGLR, SMPLBD, SMPUBD, THSD, DATA,
*                  ACTSMP, DETER2, MEAN, NOBAD,
*                  NOLARG, NOSAMP, STDDEV, STATUS )
 

*  Description:
*     To calculate the mean and variance of a set of samples, the
*     calculation takes place iteratively rejecting any samples
*     which are outside THSD * previous iteration standard deviation
*     from the mean. 
*     The calculation can be done in two modes. If SINGLR is true
*     then the noise is calculated over a single range from OUTSMP( 1 )
*     to OUTSMP( 1 ). If SINGLR is false then the calculation takes place
*     over two ranges OUTSMP( 1 ) to INSMPL and INSMPU to OUTSMP( 2 ).
*     If the argument EXTEND is true then if the number of samples 
*     in the current iteration is less than MINSMP, the length of 
*     samples taken is extended at either side and the range used
*     is entered in ACTSMP. In two range mode this implies that samples
*     outside the OUTSMP range are used but the gap in the middle (which 
*     might be excluding a source) is not altered.
*     If the argument EXTEND is false then if the number of samples
*     is less than MINSMP an error is reported and the variable
*     DETER2 is set true.
*

*	 of the inner region which is not to be included in the noise
