      SUBROUTINE DESTCRDD( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DESTCRDD

*  Purpose:
*     Removes detector-to-detector stripes from a group of CRDD files.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DESTCRDD( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine performs detector-to-detector destriping on a group
*     of CRDD files. An output CRDD file is produced for each input
*     CRDD file, holding the destriped data.  Each CRDD file is
*     destriped by subtracting a constant offset from each detector
*     data stream, so that all detectors in the output CRDD file have
*     the same background surface brightness. The mean background
*     surface brightness in each CRDD file (in MJy/sr) is preserved; no
*     attempt is made to match backgrounds between different CRDD
*     files.
*
*     Only the DATA component of each NDF is modified by this routine;
*     all other components are copied to the output without change.

*  Usage:
*     DESTCRDD IN OUT

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BACKMEAN = _REAL (Write)
*        An output parameter to which is written the mean background 
*        surface brightness after destriping. The mean is taken over 
*        all the CRDD files specified by parameter IN, and is in units 
*        of Mega-Janskys per steradian. This value is also written
*        to the screen once all the CRDD files have been processed.
*     BACKSIGMA = _REAL (Write)
*        An output parameter to which is written the standard deviation
*        of the background surface brightness after destriping. The 
*        standard deviation is taken over all CRDD files specified by 
*        parameter IN, and is in units of Mega-Janskys per steradian.
*        This value is also written to the screen once all the CRDD 
*        files have been processed. 
*     BOX = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The size of the smoothing box used during the cleaning
*        algorithm, given as a number of samples. This is roughly the
*        extent of the largest source to be rejected from each detector
*        data stream before going on to estimate the background surface
*        brightness. A value of zero causes no cleaning to be
*        performed.                                                 [40]
*     CLIP = _REAL (Read)
*        The number of standard deviations at which data will be
*        rejected by the cleaning algorithm.                       [1.0]
*     HISTORY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Determines if history information is to be stored within the
*        output CRDD files. See help on "History_in_IRAS90" for more
*        information on history. The history information will contain
*        the names of the input CRDD files, DESTCRDD parameter values,
*        and the offsets subtracted from each detector.
*                                              [current history setting]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        Specifies a group of input CRDD files. This should be in the
*        form of a group expression (see help on "Group_expressions").
*        The CRDD files must contain data from the same IRAS waveband.
*        There is no limit on the number of CRDD files which can be
*        specified.
*     MSG_FILTER = LITERAL (Read)
*        The level of information displayed on the users screen. This
*        should take one of the values QUIET, NORMAL or VERBOSE (see
*        help on "Message_filtering").
*                                       [current message filter setting]
*     NITER = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of cleaning iterations to perform. A value of zero
*        causes no cleaning to be performed.                         [4]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        A group of output CRDD files corresponding one-for-one with
*        the list of input CRDD files given for parameter IN.  This
*        should be in the form of a group expression (see help on
*        "Group_expressons"). Expressions such as "*_DS" are expanded
*        by replacing the "*" character with each input CRDD file in
*        turn.
*     QEXP = LITERAL (Read)
*        A quality expression giving the quality of samples which are
*        to be included in the estimation of the offset to be
*        subtracted from each detector. A value of "ANY" causes all
*        samples to be used, without regard to quality.            [ANY]
*     QNAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of a quality to be assigned to all samples which do
*        not contribute to the estimation of a detector offset value.
*        Samples are omitted from the detector offset calculations if
*        they are bad in the input NDF, do not satisfy the quality
*        expression given by parameter QEXP, or are rejected as source
*        samples by the cleaning algorithm. A blank value for QNAME
*        causes no quality values to be assigned.                     []
*     XNAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        If any the input NDF do not already contain any quality name
*        definitions then new quality names are put in the extension
*        specified by XNAME. This extension is created if it does not
*        already exist.                                  [QUALITY_NAMES]
*     XTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        If any new NDF extensions are created to hold quality names
*        (see parameter XNAME), then parameter XTYPE is used to obtain
*        the HDS data type for the created extensions. The run time
*        default is to give the extension a type identical to its name.
*                                                                     []

*  Examples:
*     DESTCRDD ZCMA_B1S1 ZCMA_B1S1_DS
*        This command destripes CRDD file ZCMA_B1S1 and puts the
*        results in ZCMA_B1S1_DS.
*     DESTCRDD *_RAW *|_RAW|_DS| QEXP=.NOT.(SOURCE_A.OR.SOURCE_B)
*        This command attempts to destripe all NDFs in the current
*        directory which have names ending with "_RAW", placing the 
*        results in corresponding output NDFs in which "_RAW" is 
*        replaced by "_DS". Any samples which have either of the two 
*        qualities SOURCE_A and/or SOURCE_B are excluded from the 
*        estimation of the detector offsets.

*  Estimation of Detector Offsets:
*     The user may choose to exclude certain samples from the estimation
*     of the detector offsets, by giving a "quality expression" for
*     parameter QEXP. Only those samples which have qualities satisfying
*     the given quality expression are included in the estimation of the
*     detector offsets. Qualities can be assigned to selected samples
*     using routine SETQUAL.
*     
*     After removing samples which do not satisfy the quality
*     expression, each detector data stream is "cleaned" by removing
*     any remaining bright sources which may adversly influence the
*     estimation of the background surface brightness. To do this the
*     detector data stream is smoothed with a box filter, the size of
*     which is specified by parameter BOX. The RMS residual between the
*     smoothed data and the original data is then found. All samples
*     for which the residuals exceeds a given multiple of the RMS
*     residual (specified by parameter CLIP) are rejected as belonging
*     to a bright source. The process is then repeated, excluding the
*     samples just rejected, a given number of times (specified by
*     parameter NITER). This cleaning can be switched off by specifying
*     a value of zero for either NITER or BOX.
*
*     Next, the median value of the remaining data is found, and is
*     converted into a surface brightness value in Mega-Janskys per
*     steradian (see help on "Detector_solid_angles" and
*     "Detector_bandwidths" for lists of detector effective solid
*     angles and band widths). The mean of the median surface
*     brightnesses of all detectors in the CRDD file is found. The
*     detector offsets are then calculated by subtracting this mean
*     surface brightness from each individual detector's median surface
*     brightness. The offsets are finally converted back from
*     Mega-Janskys per steradian to the units of the input CRDD file.
*
*     The offsets are then subtracted from all input samples (including
*     those previously rejected by the cleaning algorithm or the
*     quality expression), and these are then stored in the output CRDD
*     file.

*  Background Levels in the Output CRDD Files:
*     Output CRDD files retain the mean background surface brightness
*     of the input data. This may result in scan-to-scan stripes being
*     visible in images formed from the output CRDD files. These
*     stripes can be removed by processing the CRDD files produced by
*     DESTCRDD with routine BACKCRDD before combining them into an
*     image.
*
*     After all CRDD files have been destriped, the mean background 
*     surface brightness (taken over all the output CRDD files) is 
*     displayed in Mega-Janskys per steradian. The spread in background
*     values in the output CRDD files is also displayed. These values
*     are written to the output parameters BACKMEAN and BACKSIGMA.
