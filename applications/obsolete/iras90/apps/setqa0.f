      SUBROUTINE SETQA0( IGRP, IC, NDIM, NC, LIST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SETQA0

*  Purpose:
*     Convert text pixel indices into numerical pixel indices.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SETQA0( IGRP, IC, NDIM, NC, LIST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine attempts to read one integer value from each
*     name stored in the group identified by IGRP, with indices
*     between (IC-1)*NDIM+1 and IC*NDIM (inclusive). The NDIM
*     integers thus obtained are stored in elements (1,IC) to
*     (NDIM,IC) of array LIST.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for a group holding the indices of a set of
*        pixels. Each string within the group should hold a single 
*        index value, and the indices for a single pixel should be in 
*        adjacent names (eg in the order X1,Y1,Z1,X2,Y2,Z2... for a
*        three dimensional NDF).
*     IC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the array LIST at which the indices of the 
*        pixel are to be stored (i.e. the pixel number).
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The no. of dimensions (e.g. the no. of indices needed to
*        specify the pixel - 2 for a two-dimensional image).
*     NC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The total number of pixels in the group.
*     LIST( NDIM, NC ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The list of pixel indices. The indices read from the group are
*        stored in this array starting at LIST(1,IC).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Loop round each name in the group.

*  Get the next NAME.
