*  Name:
*     POINA4

*  Purpose:
*     To obtain a suitably sampled point source profile for the band required
*     and to calculate the correlation coefficients associated with it.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POINA4( PPROFL, BAND, PRFWID, PPROF, SPSQ, SIP, SP, SISQ, SI,
*                  S1, V, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine is used by POINTCRDD to re-sample an ideal
*     point source profile associated with the given waveband at the
*     same rate as the IRAS data scans. The non-zero segment of the
*     result is put into a temporary working array and the pointer to
*     its first element is returned.  The subroutine also calculates the
*     correlation coefficients associated with this point source profile.

*  Arguments:
*     PPROFL = CHARACTER (Given)
*        The name of the parameter used for the name of the Point source
*        profiles NDF.
*     BAND = INTEGER (Given)
*        Waveband number with which the associated point source profile
*        is to be re-sampled.
*     PRFWID = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the samples in the non-zero segment of the
*        re-sampled point source profile associated with the given
*        waveband.
*     PPROF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Pointer to the first element of a temporary working array which
*        contains the non-zero segment of the re-sampled point source
*        profile associated with the given waveband.
*     SPSQ = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Sum of squared profile samples.
*     SIP = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Sum of sample indices times  profile samples.
*     SP = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Sum of profile samples.
*     SISQ =DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Sum of squared sample indices.
*     SI = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Sum of sample indices.
*     S1 =DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Sum of constant 1.
*     V = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Determinant of the symmatric matrix formed by SPSQ, SIP, SP,
*        SISQ, SI, S1.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
