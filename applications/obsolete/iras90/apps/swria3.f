*  Name:
*     SWRIA3

*  Purpose:
*     Write texts non-interactively.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SWRIA3( PFILE, IRA, SCS, EPOCH, XDIM, MXNTXT, NTXT, LON,
*                  LAT, TXT, DIRX, DIRY, HIGT, JSTF, SPAC, FONT, PEN,
*                  STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine is used by application SKYWRITE to write text
*     string in the current SGS zone non-interactively. The texts and
*     their sky coordinates are defined in a text file got via parameter
*     PFILE from the environment. See note section of the prologue of
*     the SKYWRITE for the format requirement of the input text file.

*  Arguments:
*     PFILE = CHARACTER (Given)
*        The name of the parameter used to get the input text file from
*        the environment.
*     IRA = INTEGER (Given)
*        The id of the IRA system.
*     SCS = CHARACTER (Given)
*        The name of the sky coordinate system in use.
*     EPOCH = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Epoch of observation to assume for coordinates tored in a text
*        file.
*     XDIM = REAL (Given)
*        The X size of the image.
*     MXNTXT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The max. number of text string can be written to the image.
*     NTXT = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Number of text strings have been written to the image.
*     LON( MXNTXT ), LAT( MXNTXT ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Longitude and latitude of the positions at which texts has been
*        written.
*     TXT( MXNTXT ) = CHARACTER (Given and Returned)
*        The text strings have been written to the image so far.
*     DIRX( MXNTXT ), DIRY( MXNTXT ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The up directions of the texts have been written so far.
*     HIGT( MXNTXT ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The heights of the texts have been written so far.
*     RTIO( MXNTXT ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The aspect ratio of the texts have been written so far.
*     JSTF( MXNTXT ) = CHARACTER (Given and Returned)
*        The justifications of the texts have been written so far.
*     SPAC( MXNTXT ) = CHARACTER (Given and Returned)
*        The space of the characters in the texts have been written so
*        far.
*     FONT( MXNTXT ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The fonts of the texts have been written so far.
*     PEN( MXNTXT ) INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The pen of the texts have been written so far.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
