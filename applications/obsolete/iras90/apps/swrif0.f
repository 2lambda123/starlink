      SUBROUTINE SWRIF0( FRCT, GZONE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SWRIF0

*  Purpose:
*     Creat a zone FRCT% larger than the current zone.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SWRIF0( FRCT, GZONE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine create a SGS zone larger than the current zone by
*     a given precentage on the currently used graphic display surface
*     The zone created is clipped by the base zone which is the largest
*     zone can be created on the device. On exit the created zone is
*     selected as current.

*  Arguments:
*     FRCT = REAL (Given)
*       The precentage by which the created zone is larger than the
*       current zone on entry.
*     GZONE = INTEGER (Returned)
*       The ID of the newly created zone.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
