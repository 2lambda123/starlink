      SUBROUTINE COADDCRDD( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COADDCRDD

*  Purpose:
*     Coadd CRDD traces crossing specified positions.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COADDCRDD( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     The application takes a group of CRDD NDF files of any form
*     (Survey, AO, etc) and coadds the data traces for any detector which 
*     crosses the specified expected point sources. Separate coadditions 
*     are carried out for each waveband for each source position.
*
*     Any input CRDD NDF files should have been destriped previously, in 
*     order to remove detector to detector differences in calibration.
*
*     The first stage of coadding is the selection of expected source 
*     positions. All the reference positions associated with any of the 
*     input CRDD NDFs will be taken as expected point sources by COADDCRDD. 
*     The user can also specify additional expected point source positions.
*
*     By default both the displayed reference positions, and any positions 
*     of subsequent sources the user may want to enter, are specified in 
*     Equatorial(B1950) coordinates. If the user wants a different coordinate
*     system  to be used he should enter the coordinate system he requires 
*     as the COORDS parameter.
*
*     To enter additional expected point sources positions, the user should
*     set the ADD_SOURCE parameter TRUE. He will then be prompted for the 
*     name, title, longitude and latitude of each additional expected source 
*     position in the given coordinate system. This facility enables the user
*     to examine several positions close together using only one set of 
*     extracted CRDD NDF files which cover all these positions. The user 
*     should be aware that apparent point sources in a coadded trace, but not
*     at the expected source position may be spurious. He should coadd
*     the traces again using the apparent position as an expected position,
*     to see whether this source is real.
*
*     The second stage is the selection and processing of the traces, this
*     is carried out for each source at each wavelength. The processing 
*     consists of selecting those detector traces to be used, determining
*     the weights to be applied to them, and aligning the trace correctly
*     so that the correct samples are aligned at the expected point source.
*     
*     By default, a detector scan is about 4.5 arcmin wide, see Explanatory
*     Supplement Table II.C.3 for exact width of each detector, and if a
*     source position falls within that field of view, the detector
*     scan is regarded as a crossing scan and will be coadded with other
*     crossing scans. The user can modify this criterion by selecting a
*     non zero detector width extension, see parameter WIDEXT. 
*
*     When coadding, the detector data can be weighted according to a
*     combination of one or two factors, dependant on the reliability of
*     the detectors and the distance of the crossing from the expected
*     source position. The reliability factor can follow one of the
*     following schemes, see parameter WEIGHT:
*
*     1. Variance weighting: If the input CRDD files contain variance
*        values associate with each CRDD sample, the samples can be
*        weighted according to their variance so that the greater weight
*        is given to the more accurate samples. Samples with zero
*        variance are treated like bad samples and hence excluded from
*        the coadding.
*
*     2. NEFD Weight: The data from each detector can also be weighted
*        according to the noise equivalent flux density (NEFD) of the
*        detector, obtained from Exp. Supp. Fig IV.A.1., so that the
*        most noisy detectors have the lowest weighting. 
*
*     3. Equal weighting: All data from the crossing detectors
*        contribute equally to the coadded result.
*
*     All above weighting schemes can be combined with a distance effect
*     if required. If the distance effect is selected the weight(s) of a 
*     data trace is taken to be the product of the weight(s) decided 
*     from one of above schemes and a weight which is a Gaussian function 
*     of the distance of the trace centre from the expected source position.
*     With this distance weight, the effect of the detector which crosses 
*     the expected source at its edge can be reduced. The Gaussian function 
*     can have different width by specifying its value at the edges of the
*     detectors, see parameter GVDTEG. If distance weighting is not required 
*     the parameter DISTANCE should be set false.
*
*     When the input CRDD files have variance components, the default
*     weighting will be 'distance-variance', otherwise the weighting 
*     will be 'distance-NEFD'.
*
*     For each crossing scan, a sequence of about 80.0 arcmin length is 
*     extracted centered on the expected source position, these are usually
*     sufficient for source signal and noise estimation. Should a user feel 
*     it is not adequate to his requirement, he can select another 
*     sequence length via parameter SCNLEN.
*
*     During coadding, the traces are aligned with the trace which is
*     closest to the expected source position. This consists of two phases.
*     The detector traces are reversed if they traversed the sky in the 
*     opposite direction to the direction of the closest scan. Then the
*     samples are aligned so that the samples crossing the source position 
*     coincide. The interpolation used when aligning the traces can be either 
*     'nearest' or 'linear'. In nearest interpolation the sample nearest to 
*     the source position is used as a central point. In linear interpolation
*     the central value is a linear combination of the two samples closest
*     to the source position and the values for each sample worked outwards
*     from this centre is also a linear combination of the corresponding samples
*     in the original trace. The user should note that although this then 
*     aligns samples by their in-scan distance from the source point, it does
*     not take account of the fact that scans may be crossing through the source
*     at slightly different angles. Therefore the coadding may add signals that
*     are in a slightly different position in the sky but at the same in-scan 
*     distance from the source. The effect can be neglected except if looking
*     for point sources not at the expected position, where they should be
*     recoadded (see above).
*
*     If more than half of the samples in a crossing trace are bad, the trace 
*     is discarded.
* 
*     The adjusted weighted samples are then coadded together. 
*
*     For each expected point source there will be one NDF file created 
*     for each waveband where there was at least one detector which crossed 
*     the source position. Each NDF will inherit the IRAS specific information 
*     of the detector trace whose centre is closest to the expected source 
*     position among all crossing traces coadded in that NDF. This means 
*     that the position associated with each sample is likely to be very 
*     slightly wrong. The data will in fact refer to a tracelike series of
*     positions passing through the source position and parallel to the 
*     nearest detector trace, while the associated positional data will give
*     in effect the position of the center of the nearest detector trace. The 
*     maximum error in position caused by this effect will be half the width 
*     of the detector (after allowance for the users width extension). 
*     Thus more detector traces coadded gives a better result not only in 
*     the data reliability, but also in the positional accuracy. And the 
*     positional inaccuracy is only commensurate with the data inaccuracies 
*     caused by sampling at the edge of a detector.
*
*     The reason for the use of this nearest detector inheritance is that 
*     it means that coadded NDF files can be processed by some other IRAS90 
*     applications, such as TRACECRDD in the same way as a normal CRDD NDF.
*     But the user should be aware that some IRAS specific information, e.g. 
*     SOP, OBS and detector number, and such figures as cross scan distance
*     reported by the applications may be irrelevant to data trace it contains. 
*     Thus TRACECRDD will report the correct reference position, a cross scan
*     value and positions in 'get data value' that may be out by the half 
*     detector width, an average point source profile for the waveband, and
*     a detector number which is not applicable.
*
*     Users should also be aware that they should not use coadded scans in
*     subsequent coadding or image preparation with eg MAPCRDD. This is because
*     of two things, firstly the positional inaccuracies noted above, and 
*     secondly that since the coadded scan already contains processed weighting
*     applying a second weighting is going to use the wrong weight values, and
*     assume only accuracy appropriate for a single scan.
*
*     Under normal usage a logfile will be produced containing details of the
*     crossing information which are not reported to the screen. 

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ADD_SOURCE = LOGICAL (Read)
*        When this is true the user is prompted to supply details of 
*        additional source positions.
*     AUTOMATIC = LOGICAL (Read)
*        When it has the value true, the application will run in the
*        automatic mode, where output file names, titles and labels of
*        the output NDF files (one for each expected source) will be
*        generated by the application. Otherwise the user will be
*        prompted for these values. [TRUE]
*     OUT = NDF (Read)
*        The name of the output NDF file containing the coadded data
*        trace for each expected point source. It will only be used when
*        the application is running in non-automatic mode. If the 
*        application is running in automatic mode the default value will
*        be "coadded_"sourcename"_b"waveband number eg coadded_wola_b3 .
*     COORDS = LITERAL (Read)
*        Sky coordinate system used to specify the additional expected
*        point source positions. When reporting in the log file, this
*        sky coordinate system will also be used to describe the crossed
*        expected point source position. Valid values include ECLIPTIC, 
*        EQUATORIAL and GALACTIC. See help on "Sky_coordinates" for more 
*        information on available sky coordinate systems.
*        [current sky coordinate system]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        Specifies a group of input CRDD NDF files. This should be in the
*        form of a group expression (see help on "Group_expressions").
*        All files in the group should be from the same CRDD type, but can 
*        be from different waveband. If an expected source is crossed by 
*        the detector traces from the different wavebands, the coadding 
*        will be performed for each waveband.  
*     DISTANCE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If it is true, the distance of the centre of a trace from the
*        expected source position will be taken into account when
*        deciding the weight used when coadding. Otherwise, the distance
*        will not be taken into account. [TRUE]
*     GVDTEG = _REAL (Read)
*        The value of the Gaussian weighting function at the edge of the
*        detector used when the distance of trace centre to the
*        expected source position is taken into account. The default
*        value is such that the detector traces which see the
*        expected source at the edge of their field of view will have
*        half weighting compared with the traces pass the expected
*        source at their centre. [0.5]
*     INTER = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the interpolation method to be used when aligning the
*        crossing traces. It can take following values:
*
*         LINEAR - The linear interpolation method is to be used.
*
*         NEAREST - The nearest neighborhood method is to be used.
*
*        The input can be abbreviated to an unambiguous length and is
*        case insensitive. [LINEAR] 
*     LOGFILE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the logging file to contain the reporting of the
*        crossing and related information for all expected point source
*        position. [coaddcrdd.log]
*     MSG_FILTER = LITERAL (Given)
*        The level of information displayed on the users screen. This
*        should take one of the values QUIET, NORMAL or VERBOSE (see
*        help on "Message_filtering").  [current message filter setting]
*     OFILTXT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the text file containning the names of the output
*        NDF this file can be used as the input file for the following
*        applications which accept group NDF specification.
*        [outndf.log]
*     SCNLEN = _REAL (Read)
*        The length of the scan in aremin extracted around the expected
*        source from a crossing trace to be coadded with the other
*        crossing traces. [80.0]
*     SOURCE_LAT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The sky latitude of the additional expected source position,        
*        in the coordinate system specified by the parameter COORDS 
*        (eg if COORDS is EQUATORIAL then SOURCE_LAT should be given 
*         the Declination of the image centre). See help on
*        "Sky_coordinates" for the formats allowed for this value.
*        The application will keep prompting for the next expected
*        source position until a null, '!', value is given to the 
*        parameter SOURCE_NAME. 
*     SOURCE_LON = LITERAL (Read)
*        The sky longitude of the additional expected source position, 
*        in the coordinate system specified by the parameter COORDS 
*        (eg if COORDS is EQUATORIAL then source_LON should be given the
*        Right Ascension of the image centre). See help on
*        "Sky_coordinates" for the formats allowed for this value.
*        The application will keep prompting for the next expected
*        source position until a null, '!', value is given to the 
*        parameter SOURCE_NAME. 
*     SOURCE_NAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the additional expected sources specified by the
*        user. The application will keep prompting for the name of the
*        next source until a null value,'!' is supplied. [!]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The title of the output NDF file which contains the coadded
*        data trace. In the automation mode, the title of the NDF for a
*        expected source will be created by the application by
*        concatenating the string 'COADDCRDD:' and the source name. And
*        hance this parameter will not be used in this mode. 
*     WEIGHT = LITERAL
*        The weighting scheme used when coadding. It can take following
*        values:
*        
*          VARIANCE - Samples in the traces are weighted according to
*                     the variance associated with them.
*
*          NEFD - The traces are weighted according to the noise equivalent
*                 flux density (NEFD) of their detector.
*
*          EQUAL - The traces are uniformly weighted.
*
*        The input can be abbrievated to an unambiguous length and is
*        case insensitive. []
*     WIDEXT = _REAL (Read)
*        The detector width extenion. With this parameter being non-
*        zero, the detector width used by the application becomes
*        DETWID + WIDEXT * DETWID, where DETWID is the width of the 
*        detector (about 4.5 arcmin, see exp. suppl. Table II.C.3 for 
*        its exact value for each detector), and if an expected source 
*        position falls within the scan field of this width, the detecor 
*        trace is regarded as a crossing trace. It is recommended that if
*        this parameter is to be used, its value should be selected 
*        between 0.0 and -1.0 so that the detectors which see the soucre 
*        at the edge of their field of view will not be selected. [0.0]
