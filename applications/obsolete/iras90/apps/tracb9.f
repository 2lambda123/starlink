*  Name:

*  Purpose:
*     Draw an additional curve on an NCAR display.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRACB9( BSMP, ESMP, X, Y, BSEG, ESEG, XOFFST, YOFFST, 
*                  YAMPLF, YSLOPE, XLMT, YLMT, XORDER, YORDER,

*  Description:
*     This routine is used for drawing an additional curve segement on
*     an NCAR display. The curve in the display are the offset and
*     amplified segment of the curve given by X and Y array. In x
*     direction, the curve will have a constant offset given by XOFFST.
*     In y direction, the curve will be amplified by YAMPLF and will
*     not only have a constant offset given by YOFFST, but also have a
*     slope offset given by YSLOPE*( x distance from the centre of the
*     segment ).  It assumes that NCAR grid window has the bounds (0.0,
*     1.0, 0.0, 1.0 ) on entering and the plotting system is SGS.

*  Arguments:
*     BSMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The begin index of samples in the curve.
*     ESMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The end index of samples in the curve.
*     X( BSMP : ESMP ) = REAL (Given)
*        The x value of the curve at each sample.
*     Y( BSMP : ESMP ) = REAL (Given)
*        The y value of the curve at each sample.
*     BSEG = INTEGER (Given)
*        The begin sample index of the segment to be drawn.
*     ESEG = INTEGER (Given)
*        The end sample index of the segment to be drawn.
*     XOFFST = REAL (Given)
*        The offset in X direction of the curve when display.
*     YOFFST = REAL (Given)
*        The offset in Y direction of the curve when display.
*     YAMPLF = REAL (Given)
*        The  y amplifier factor of the curve.
*     YSLOPE = REAL (Given)
*        The slope in Y direction of the curve.
*     XLMT( 2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The lower and upper X limits of the NCAR display in user's 
*        coordinates. XLMT( 2 ) should always be greater than XLMT( 1 ).
*     YLMT( 2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The lower and upper Y limits of the NCAR display in user's 
*        coordinates. YLMT( 2 ) should always be greater than YLMT( 1 ).
*     XORDER = INTEGER (Given)
*        When it is 0, the x coordinates of the NCAR display increases
*        from left to right, i.e. XLMT( 1 ) is at left end of the axis
*        and XLMT( 2 ) at right end of the axis. When it is 1, the x
*        coordinates decreases from left to right.
*     YORDER = INTEGER (Given)
*        When it is 0, the y coordinates of the NCAR display increases
*        from bottom to top, i.e. YLMT( 1 ) is at the bottom end of the
*        axis and YLMT( 2 ) at top end of the axis. When it is 1, the y
*        coordinates decreases from bottom to top.
*     PEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The pen number used to draw the curve.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
