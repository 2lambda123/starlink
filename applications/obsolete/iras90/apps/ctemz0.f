*  Name:
*     CTEMZ0

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain cubic spline fits to temperature and BAND1 flux.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CTEMZ0( BAND1, BAND2, BETA, LERR, RERR, LCK, IPLKR, IPCKR,
*                  IPLKF1, IPCKF1, RATLO, RATHI, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The observed model flux in both wavebands is evaluated at 45
*     temperatures logarithmically spaced between 30 K and 10000 K.  A
*     cubic spline is fitted to the observed model flux for BAND1 using
*     temperature as the independant variable. The knots and
*     coefficients are returned. The ratio of observed model flux in
*     BAND1 to that in BAND2 is found. Another cubic spline is found
*     using these ratio values as the independant variable and
*     temperature as the dependant variable. The knots and coefficients
*     are returned. The maximum and minimum ratio values for which this
*     cubic spline is defined are also returned.

*  Arguments:
*     BAND1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower waveband index.

*        use.
*     LCK = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of knots in the returned cubic splines.
*     IPLKR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to an array holding the positions of the knots for
*        the cubic spline which gives temperature as a function of flux
*        ratio.
*     IPLKR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to an array holding the coefficients for the cubic
*        spline which gives temperature as a function of flux ratio.
*     IPLKF1 = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to an array holding the positions of the knots for
*        the cubic spline which gives observed model flux in BAND1
*        as a function of temperature.
*     IPLKF1 = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to an array holding the coefficients for the cubic
*        spline which gives observed model flux in BAND1 as a function
*        of temperature.

*        The lowest usable flux ratio value.
*     RATHI = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
