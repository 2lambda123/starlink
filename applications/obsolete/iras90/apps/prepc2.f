      SUBROUTINE PREPC2( PARAM, IGRP, SIZE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PREPC2

*  Purpose:
*     Sort input NDFs into data and noise grids.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PREPC2( PARAM, IGRP, SIZE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The input NDFs are examined to see if there are any pairs of
*     associated data and noise grids. The user has an option of
*     choosing to store the data and noise grids in separate output
*     NDFs, or to store them in the DATA and VARIANCE components of the
*     same output NDF. This option is selected using the parameter
*     specified by PARAM. If such pairs are to be stored in the same
*     output NDF, then the noise grid NDF is removed from the group
*     identified by IGRP(1) and placed in the group identified by
*     IGRP(7) at the same index as the corresponding data grid NDF.
*     The items stored in the other groups which were associated with
*     the noise grid (title, label, etc) are discarded. Doing this
*     introduces a gap in group IGRP(1). Such gaps are removed before
*     the group is returned by shuffling the entries to lower indices.
*
*     At the moment, noise grids are only available for PO and YORIC
*     images. PO noise and data grids are considered to be associated if
*     they have the same waveband index, grid number and units. YORIC
*     images are associated if they have the same waveband index, units,
*     OBJECT keyword value, DATE keyword value and ITERNO keyword value.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER (Given)
*        The parameter to use to see if noise grids should be stored
*        within the VARIANCE components of the output NDFs holding the
*        corresponding data grids.
*     ( 7 ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The GRP identifiers for groups holding information about the
*        input NDFs. Group 1 holds the input data grids, 2 holds output
*        NDF names, 3 holds output titles, 4 holds output labels, 5
*        holds output field longitudes and 6 holds output field
*        latitudes, 7 holds input noise grids.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of entries in groups 1 to 7. The returned value
*        will be smaller than the supplied value if any NDFs are
*        transferred from group 1 to group 7.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
