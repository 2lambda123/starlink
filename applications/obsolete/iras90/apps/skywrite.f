      SUBROUTINE SKYWRITE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SKYWRITE

*  Purpose:
*     Write text strings at specified positions.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SKYWRITE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine provides users with facilities to write text
*     strings at specified positions within the most recently created
*     DATA picture. Particularly, it can:
*
*        1. Write text strings at the sky positions specified by
*        parameters.
*
*        2. Write text strings at the sky positions specified within
*        a text file.
*
*        3. Write text strings at the cursor position.
*
*     The attributes of the text, that is, the direction, the height,
*     the aspect ratio, the justification, the font and the colour, can
*     be set using various parameters.
*
*     In interactive mode (cursor or keyboard), the application will
*     keep prompting the user for the specifications of the next text
*     string and/or position until a null response is obtained.
*
*     In non-interactive mode, an input text file is required which can
*     be the output of a previous run of this routine or can be created
*     by the user. The format of this file is described in the "Notes:"
*     section.
*
*     After getting a null reponse when in interactive mode, or
*     finishing writing in the non-interactive mode, the application
*     will exit by default. But users can choose to use the application
*     in a even greater loop, invisible to users by default, in which
*     users can interactively and/or non-interactively write texts,
*     change working mode, set new text attribute, save the information
*     of present writing into a text file for later use and erase the
*     last writing, etc., see parameter LOOP.

*  Usage:
*     SKYWRITE DEVICE IN

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ATTRIBUTE = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter is used to specify which attribute of the text
*        is to be set. It takes the following values:
*
*         DIRECTION - Set the text 'up' direction.
*         
*         HEIGHT - Set the text height.
*
*         ASPECT RATIO - Set aspect ratio (width/height) of the
*         characters in the text.
*
*         JUSTIFICATION - Set the text justification.
*
*         SPACE - Set the space between characters in the text.
*
*         FONT - Set the font for the text.
*
*         PEN - Set the text colour.
*
*         DEFAULT - Select the default settings for all text attributes.
*
*         SHOW - Show the current text attribute settings.
*
*        The application will keep prompting for more attributes until
*        DEFAULT, or a null value is supplied.                 [DEFAULT]
*     CLEAR = LOGICAL (Read)
*        True if the area of the graphics device over which the text is
*        to be written should be cleared before writing commences.  [NO]
*     COORDS = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the sky coordinate system to use. Valid values
*        include ECLIPTIC, EQUATORIAL, GALACTIC. See help on
*        "Sky_coordinates" for more information on available sky
*        coordinate systems.
*                                        [current sky coordinate system]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The plotting device.     [Current image-display-overlay device]
*     DIRECTION = Real (Read)
*        A pair of values specifing character orientation in terms of a
*        vector. Only the direction of the vector is significant. On
*        entry, the text up direction is set as upwards, that is (0,1).
*     EPOCH = DOUBLE PRECISION (Read)
*        The Julian epoch at which the supplied sky positions were
*        determined. This is only used if sky coordinates supplied in a
*        text file (in FILE mode) are stored in a coordinate system
*        different to that specified by the COORDS parameter. In this
*        case the epoch may be necessary to perform the conversion from
*        one coordinate system to the other (depending on what the
*        coordinate systems are). A value of 1983.5 is acceptable for
*        all IRAS data.                                         [1983.5]
*     FILE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the text file containing specifications of the
*        text strings to be written.
*     FONT = INTEGER (Read)
*        Font number of the text string. See GKS user guide for details
*        about the available fonts.
*     HEIGHT = REAL (Read)
*        Specifies the height of the character in the text string. It
*        should be given as the fraction of the horizontal dimension of
*        the displayed image. On entry, it is 0.02, that is, 1/50 of
*        the width of the displayed image.
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF from which to read the astrometry information. This
*        will usually be the NDF holding the displayed image. A null
*        value will cause the astrometry to be located using
*        information stored within the AGI database. If this cannot be
*        done, then the user will be re-prompted for an NDF using
*        parameter IN.  If a section of an NDF is specified, the curves
*        are only drawn over the specified section of the picture.   [!]
*     JUST = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the disposition of the text string with respect to
*        the given position on the displayed image. The first character
*        of JUST should be one of B, C and T, specifies whether the
*        given position is to lie on the bottom, centre, or top edge of
*        the string. The second should be one of L, C and R and
*        specifies whether the given position is lie on the left,
*        centre or right edge of the string. Only first two characters
*        in JUST will be used. On entry it is set to 'BC'.
*     LAT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The latitude at which a text string is to be written, in the
*        coordinate system specified by COORDS (eg if COORDS was
*        EQUATORIAL, LAT should be given a Declination value).  See
*        help on "Sky_coordinates" for more information on available
*        sky coordinate systems.
*     LOGFILE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the log text file containing the information
*        about the written text strings. See the NOTES section about 
*        the format of this file. 
*     LON = LITERAL (Read)
*        The longitude at which a text string is to be written, in the
*        coordinate system specified by COORDS (eg if COORDS was
*        EQUATORIAL, LON should be given a Right Ascension value).  See
*        help on "Sky_coordinates" for more information on available
*        sky coordinate systems.
*     LOOP = LOGICAL (Read)
*        If true then the routine does not exit when the final text
*        string has been written. Instead, the user is allowed to
*        modify the current drawing by selecting from the options
*        provided by parameter OPTION.                              [NO]
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The source from which text string specifications are obtained.
*
*        CURSOR - All positions are specified by cursor. This mode will
*        only be available on graphic devices which support cursors.
* 
*        KEYBOARD - Positions are specified in response to parameter
*        prompts, using the keyboard.
*
*        FILE - Strings are drawn according to the specifications
*        contained within a text file (see parameter FILE). This is
*        referred to as "non-interactive" mode. The run-time default is 
*        CURSOR if a cursor is available, and KEYBOARD otherwise.     []
*     MSG_FILTER = LITERAL (Read)
*        The level of information displayed on the users screen. This
*        should take one of the values QUIET, NORMAL or VERBOSE (see
*        help on "Message_filtering").  [current message filter setting]
*     OPTION = LITERAL (Read)
*        The action to take once all strings have been written. It can
*        take following values:
*
*         CONTINUE - Continue to draw further text strings.
*
*         MODE - Change the source from which further text string
*         specifications will be obtained.
*
*         ATTRIBUTES - Set the attributes of any further text strings to
*         be written.
*
*         SAVE - Save information describing the text strings written so
*         far to a text file.
*
*         ERASE - Erase the last writen text string.
*         
*         EXIT - Exit the application.
*
*        This parameter is only prompted for if parameter LOOP has a
*        true value.                                              
*     PEN = INTEGER (Read)
*        Pen number used to write the texts. On entry the pen number is
*        set to 3.
*     RATIO = REAL (Read)
*        Specifies the aspect ration (Width/Height) of the charactors
*        in the text string. On entry it is set to 2/3.
*     SPACE = REAL (Read)
*        The space between characters in text strings, as a fraction of 
*        the width of a character. On entry it is set to 0 which means 
*        no extra space between characters and results in the text 
*        being of normal appearance. It can be negative which results 
*        in the characters overlapping.
*     TEXT = LITERAL (Read)
*       The text string to be written at a specified position.

*  Notes:
*     -  The strings are drawn within the current picture only if it is
*     a DATA picture, otherwise strings are drawn in the last DATA
*     picture to be created within the current picture.
*
*     -  The astrometry information used to position the strings is
*     located using the following search path:
*
*        o  Firstly, astrometry information is looked for in any NDF
*        specified on the command line using parameter IN.
*
*        o  Secondly, astrometry information is looked for in any MORE
*        structure associated with the AGI picture.
*
*        o  Thirdly, astrometry information is looked for in any
*        reference object associated with the AGI picture.
*
*        o  If all else fails, the value of the IN parameter is
*        cancelled, and the user is prompted for the NDF containing
*        relevant astrometry information.
*      
*     -  This routine can only be used to display strings over NDFs
*     which contain astrometry information in the form used by the
*     IRAS90 package.
*
*     - The format of input and output text files is:
*   
*        o The file is divided into comments and fields. Comments
*        consist of strings commencing with a "#" character, and are
*        considered to extend to the end of the line. Such comments are
*        ignored. Fields are strings which specify any of the items of
*        information described below. Each line in the file may contain
*        any number of fields, multiple fields being separated by
*        commas. Blank lines or fields are ignored.
*
*        o The first field should give the name of the sky coordinate
*        system used (see help on "Sky_coordinates").
*
*        o There should then follow a block of fields defining the text
*        strings to be written and the positions at which to write
*        them. A position and text string takes three consecutive
*        fields. The first and second fields are the longitude and
*        latitude of the position. The third field is the string to be
*        written to the position. The string may be delimited by single
*        or double quote marks, which will be ignored. If a blank string
*        is to be written, it MUST be delimited by quote marks.
*      
*        o Fields containing the key words DIRECTION, HEIGHT, ASPECT
*        RATIO, JUSTIFICATION, FONT, SPACE, PEN and DEFAULT set up the
*        attributes to be used for writing any remaining text strings. 
*        Keywords can be abbreviated, and are case insensitive.
*
*        o A field containing the keyword DIRECTION should be followed
*        by two fields giving the direction vector of the text with X
*        component first, and Y component second.
*
*        o A field containing the keyword HEIGHT should be followed by
*        a single field giving the text height.
*
*        o A field containing the keyword ASPECT RATIO should be
*        followed by a single field giving the character aspect ration
*        (width/height).
*
*        o A field containing the keyword JUSTIFICATION should be
*        followed by a single field giving the disposition of the text
*        string with respect to the specified position.
*
*        o A field containing the keyword FONT should be followed by a
*        single field giving the font number.
*   
*        o A field containing the keyword SPACE should be followed by a
*        single field giving the space between characters.
*   
*        o A field containing the keyword PEN should be followed by a
*        single field giving the pen number.
*   
*        o A field containing the keyword DEFAULT causes the default 
*        text attributes to be re-established.
