*  Name:
*     FIND19

*  Purpose:
*     This is the third test used in FINDCRDD to determine whether a
*     scan passes sufficiently close to the source position that the
*     user might require it.
*     The third stage of testing is a refinement on the second.
*     Again the satellite angles IRAS would have had to see the source
*     are calculated, and compared with the actual satellite angle
*     range for the observation under consideration. But in this stage
*     both the source position and the solar longitude are evaluated
*     at the epoch of the best estimate of the crossing time.
*     The calculation is repeated through four iterations to refine the
*     crossing time, and hence the positions. The first of these
*     iterations is only used to get an initial estimate of the crossing
*     time and no acceptance test is carried out in this iteration.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FIND19( OBPS, OBPSHI, OBPSLO, OBPSR, OBST1D, OBST2D,

*  Description:
*     This is the third test used in FINDCRDD to determine whether a
*     scan passes sufficiently close to the source position that the
*     user might require it.
*     The third stage of testing is a refinement on the second.
*     Again the satellite angles IRAS would have had to see the source
*     are calculated, and compared with the actual satellite angle
*     range for the observation under consideration. But in this stage
*     both the source position and the solar longitude are evaluated
*     at the epoch of the best estimate of the crossing time.
*     The calculation is repeated through four iterations to refine the
*     crossing time, and hence the positions. The first of these
*     iterations is only used to get an initial estimate of the crossing
*     time and no acceptance test is carried out in this iteration.
*     
*     The subroutine carries out the following stages:-
*     
*     -  Calculate the cross scan test size as half the cross scan
*        extent plus the focal plane half width. This is less than the
*        stage 2 cross scan test, and is not applied until the source
*        and satellite epochs are close in time (ie not for the first
*        iteration)
*
*     -  Set the initial crossing time as the start time of the
*        observation.
*        
*     For 4 iterations - The first of these is only to get an
*     approximate crossing time, and the cross scan test is ommitted
*     as this would be too tight.
*
*     - Calculate the crossing time, as decimal years eg 1983.???
*       using FIND46.
*
*     - Calculate the ecliptic coords of the source at this time,
*       from the source ecliptic 1950 coords, using FIND12.
*
*     - Calculate the solar longitude at this time, from SOP, solar
*       longitude and solar longitude rate, using FIND43.
*
*     - Calculate the source satellite angles at this time, from the
*       source ecliptic coords at this time, and the solar longitude
*       at this time, using FIND41.
*
*     - Calculate the abberation error to be applied, using FIND01
*
*     - Calculate
*       the absolute value of ( source theta - observation theta )
*       and compare it with the cross scan half width test size.
*
*     If this criterion is met then
*
*     - Compare the source psi with the range of psi covered by
*       the observation. This consists of three alternatives:-
*       i)  The observation psi lo is greater than zero and
*           observation psi lo < source psi <= observation psi hi.
*       ii)  The observation psi lo is less than zero and
*            observation psi lo + 2*pi < source psi <= 2*pi.
*       iii) The observation psi lo is less than zero and
*            0 < source psi <= observation psi hi.
*                
*     If this criterion is met then
*
*     - Calculate the revised crossing time as either:-
*       i)   If criterion i) above is met then
*            time of crossing = time of observation start +
*            ( source psi - start of observation psi ) / observation
*                                                           psi rate
*       ii)  If criterion ii) above is met then
*            time of crossing = time of observation end +
*            ( source psi - end of observation psi ) / observation
*                                                        psi rate
*       iii) If criterion iii) above is met then
*            time of crossing = time of observation start +
*            ( source psi - start of observation psi ) / observation
*                                                           psi rate
*       The calculation is actually incorperated in the test criteria
*       above.
