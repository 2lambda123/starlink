*  Name:
*     SIMCF1

*  Purpose:
*     To create a single pixel weight grid assuming it will fit into the
*     current grid.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SIMCF1( C4, PXLO, PXHI, PYLO, PYHI, PSF, PWGSZX, PWGSZY,
*                  RLO, RHI, PLO, PHI, PWGRID, WORK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The entire grid is first filled with zeros.  The supplied PSF
*     values weights are then mapped into the pixel weights grid using
*     the supplied transformation. The pixel within the grid which is
*     closest to the a PSF pixel is increment by the pixel value (all
*     PSF values are assumed to lie within the pixel grid). The bounds
*     of the pixel region in which non-zero weights lie is returned.
*
*     An attempt is made to smooth out the noise introduced by the
*     nearest neightbour truncation applied to the pixel coordinates.
*     This is done by deciding on the nominal number of PSF values which
*     should contribute to each pixel weight value (determined by the
*     relative areas of the PSF and sky pixels), and then correcting
*     the calculated weight values if they actually had more or less
*     contributions than the nominal number.
