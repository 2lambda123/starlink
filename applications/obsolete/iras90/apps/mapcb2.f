*  Name:
*     MAPCB2

*  Purpose:
*     Paste a detector data stream, assuming BAD pixels, sample
*     weighting, and no output variances.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MAPCB2( IDC, IDA, WFACT, DET, DETNO, SFACT, VFACT, SAMP0,
*                  START, END, SAMPLO, DINDLO, SAMPHI, DINDHI, XLO,

*  Description:
*     This routine adds the data stored in a single detector data
*     stream to the "running-sum" images, DATOUT and WGTOUT.
*     Checks for BAD values are performed on the input data and
*     variance values.  Any sample for which either value is BAD (or
*     which has zero variance) is excluded from the output image. Each
*     input data sample is given a total weight equal to the reciprocal
*     of the its variance (converted from a flux variance to a surface
*     brightness variance). No output variances are created.
