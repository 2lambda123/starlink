*  Name:
*     BACKA0

*  Purpose:
*     Remove a constant background from a single CRDD file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL BACKA0( IDC, DHIGH, DLOW, SHIGH, SLOW, DATIN, DATTMP, NSIGMA,
*                  UNITS, OUTBAC, OUTTYP, OK, QNAME, LOCS, DATOUT, BAD,
*                  REMOVE, WORK1, WORK2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The background surface brightness in the input data is estimated
*     by a "robust" method in which successive median values are found,
*     excluding points which lay a long way from the previous median
*     value. If OUTTYP is DATA, this background is then subtracted from
*     the input data resulting in it having zero background, and the
*     requested output surface brightness is then added back on. If
*     OUTTYP is BACKGROUND, the output array is filled with the
*     background value.

*  Arguments:
*     IDC = INTEGER (Given)
*        IRC identifier for the input CRDD file.
*     DHIGH = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bound on detector index.
*     DLOW = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bound on detector index.
*     SHIGH = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bound on sample number.
*     SLOW = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bound on sample number.
*     DATIN( SLOW:SHIGH, DLOW:DHIGH ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input data.
*     DATTMP( SLOW:SHIGH, DLOW:DHIGH ) = REAL (Given)
*        A copy of the input data from which has been removed (by being
*        set bad) any samples not satisying the users quality 
*        expression.
*     NSIGMA = REAL (Given)
*        The no. of standard deviations from the median at which data
*        should be rejected.
*     UNITS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The units of the input CRDD file.
*     OUTBAC = REAL (Given)
*        The required background surface brightness in the output data.
*        Given in units of Mega-Janskys per steradian.
*     OUTTYP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The type of output required; DATA if the background subtracted
*        data is to be stored in DATOUT; BACKGROUND if the background
*        itself is to be stored in DATOUT.
*     OK = LOGICAL (Given)
*        True if the locators in LOCS are valid. If OK is supplied
*        false, then no quality is assigned to un-used samples.
*     QNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A quality name to be assigned to all samples which do not
*        participate in the calculation of the scan background. These
*        include samples which are bad in the input data, samples which
*        do not satisfy the given quality expression, and samples which
*        are rejected by the cleaning algorithm.
*     LOCS( 5 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        An array of locators which relate to the quality information
*        stored in the output NDF. Not used if OK is false.
*     DATOUT( SLOW:SHIGH, DLOW:DHIGH ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The output data.
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if the output contains any bad values.
*     REMOVE = REAL (Returned)
*        The background surface brightness value for the CRDD, in
*        Mega-Janskys per steradian.
*     WORK1( SLOW:SHIGH, DLOW:DHIGH ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     WORK2( DLOW:DHIGH ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
