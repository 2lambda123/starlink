      SUBROUTINE MAPCRDD( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     MAPCRDD

*  Purpose:
*     Maps a group of CRDD files into a two dimensional image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MAPCRDD( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine maps a group of CRDD files into a two dimensional
*     surface brightness image by coadding the data samples. The
*     algorithm used is described below, together with the extensive
*     facilities which exist for tailoring the behaviour of the
*     application.

*  Usage:
*     MAPCRDD IN PIXSIZE CENTRE_LON CENTRE_LAT BOXSIZE OUT 

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BOXSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        A pair of numbers giving the dimensions of the output image in
*        arc-minutes, along the two image axes. The default values for
*        CENTRE_LON, CENTRE_LAT and BOXSIZE offered to the user are
*        chosen so that all the input data (excluding the short
*        sections at the ends of each scan which have coverage by only
*        half of the detectors) just fits in the image.  If the image
*        is large, the distance between the sides (in terms of arc
*        minutes) will change due to projection effects.  The given
*        values are the distances between the centre points of opposite
*        sides of the image. If only one value is given, the created
*        image is square with the size of each side equal to the
*        supplied value.
*     CENTRE_LAT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The sky latitude of the centre of the output image, in the
*        coordinate system specified by the parameter COORDS (eg if
*        COORDS is EQUATORIAL then CENTRE_LAT should be given the
*        Declination of the image centre). See help on
*        "Sky_coordinates" for the formats allowed for this value.
*     CENTRE_LON = LITERAL (Read)
*        The sky longitude of the centre of the output image, in the
*        coordinate system specified by the parameter COORDS (eg if
*        COORDS is EQUATORIAL then CENTRE_LON should be given the Right
*        Ascension of the image centre).See help on "Sky_coordinates"
*        for the formats allowed for this value.
*     COORDS = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the coordinate system used for referring to sky
*        positions. Valid values include ECLIPTIC, EQUATORIAL,
*        GALACTIC. See help on "Sky_coordinates" for more information
*        on available sky coordinate systems.
*                                        [current sky coordinate system]
*     EXCLUDE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A group of detector numbers, selected from those available in
*        the IRAS waveband of the data contained in the input CRDD
*        files. All data from the specified detectors are excluded from
*        the final map (dead detectors are automatically excluded). See
*        help on "Specifying_detectors" for more information on
*        specifying groups of detector numbers. The parameter INCLUDE
*        can alternatively be used to specify the detectors to use. The
*        default value of SMALL causes all the small detectors to be 
*        excluded.                                               [SMALL]
*     FWHM = _REAL (Read)
*        Two values specifying the full widths at half maximum of the
*        Gaussian weighting functions for a full-size detector (in
*        arc-minutes) in the cross-scan and in-scan directions.  The
*        values actually used for each detector are scaled in
*        proportion to the size of the detector. The weighting function
*        is truncated to zero at the edge of the detector mask. The
*        default values are the maximum cross-scan and in-scan detector
*        sizes for the relevant waveband, and result in the weighting
*        function falling to 0.5 before it is truncated at the edge of
*        the detector.  If a single value is given, the same value is
*        used for both cross-scan and in-scan widths.                 []
*     GAUSSIAN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If GAUSSIAN is set to a true value, then a Gaussian weighting
*        function is applied to all input CRDD samples (i.e. each CRDD
*        sample has a greater influence on pixels near the detector
*        centre than it does on the pixels near the edge). This can
*        decrease the noise and improve the resolution in the output
*        image, but at the cost of a slightly greater run-time.   [TRUE]
*     HISTORY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Determines if history information is to be stored within the
*        output NDF. See help on "History_in_IRAS90" for more
*        information on history. The history information will contain
*        the names of the input CRDD files, MAPCRDD parameter values
*        used to create the image, and the detector solid angles and
*        effective bandwidth used.             [current history setting]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        Specifies a group of input CRDD files. This should be in the
*        form of a group expression (see help on "Group_expressions").
*        All CRDD files must contain data from the same IRAS waveband.
*        There is no limit on the number of CRDD files which can be
*        specified.
*     INCLUDE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A group of detector numbers, selected from those available in
*        the IRAS waveband of the data contained in the input CRDD
*        files. Only data from the specified detectors are included in
*        the final map. The parameter EXCLUDE can alternatively be used
*        to specify the detectors to be omitted. Values specified for
*        the INCLUDE parameter take precidence over those specified for
*        the EXCLUDE parameter.  See help on "Specifying_detectors"
*        for more information on specifying groups of detector numbers.
*        The default group contains all the available detectors,
*        excluding those specified by the EXCLUDE parameter.          []
*     MSG_FILTER = LITERAL (Read)
*        The level of information displayed on the users screen. This
*        should take one of the values QUIET, NORMAL or VERBOSE (see
*        help on "Message_filtering").
*                                       [current message filter setting]
*     ORIENT = _REAL (Read)
*        The position angle of the second image axis( or "Y" axis), in
*        degrees.  That is, the angle from north (defined by the
*        coordinate system specified by parameter COORDS) to the image
*        "Y" axis ("upwards" if the image is displayed normally).
*        Positive angles are measured in the same sense as rotation
*        from north through east.  The default value of zero puts
*        north "upwards".                                          [0.0]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The name of the NDF to hold the output image. The output NDF
*        may have defined VARIANCE or HISTORY components depending on
*        the value of the VAROUT and HISTORY parameters, but never has
*        defined QUALITY or AXIS components.
*     PIXSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The dimensions of a pixel in the output image, in arc-minutes.
*        If a single value is given for PIXSIZE, then the output pixels
*        are square. If two values are given then the output pixels are
*        rectangular, having the specified dimensions. It should be
*        remembered that the actual pixel size may vary slightly across
*        the image depending on the type of projection. The values
*        specified by parameter PIXSIZE give the actual pixel
*        dimensions at the image centre.
*     PROJTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the type of projection to use when creating the
*        output image. Valid values include GNOMONIC (i.e. tangent
*        plane), ORTHOGRAPHIC, LAMBERT and AITOFF.  See help on
*        "Map_projections" for more information on available
*        projections.                                         [GNOMONIC]
*     QEXP = LITERAL (Read)
*        A quality expression (see help on "Quality_in_IRAS90").  Only
*        those samples from the input CRDD files which have a QUALITY
*        satisfying the given quality expression will be included in
*        the mapping process. The default value of "ANY" causes all
*        data to be used regardless of QUALITY.  If any of the quality
*        names referenced in the quality expression are not defined for
*        an input CRDD file, then the entire CRDD file is included in
*        the map, irrespective of QUALITY. The user is warned if this
*        happens. Note, the output image has no QUALITY component.
*                                                                  [ANY]
*     SECSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The cross-scan and in-scan sizes of a full size detector
*        "sector" in arc-minutes.  Smaller values will produce a more
*        accurately Gaussian in-scan weighting function, but will
*        increase the run-time in proportion. The default values are
*        both equal to half of the minimum of the two pixel dimensions
*        (given by parameter PIXSIZE). If a single value is given then
*        the same value is used for both dimensions. The values used
*        for SECSIZE are internally limited to be less than or equal to
*        the pixel dimensions. Sector sizes for small detectors are
*        reduced in proportion to the detector size (the sector weights
*        are reduced by the same factor).                             []
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A title to be stored with the output image. The default is the
*        value of the TITLE component from the first input CRDD file. []
*     UNITS = LITERAL (Read)
*        The units in which the output image values are required.  See
*        help on "Data_units" for a list of the available units.  Note,
*        when the selected units represent flux (or flux density) per
*        pixel values, all pixels are considered to be the same size.
*        This may not be the case if a large area is being mapped (more
*        than a few degrees), resulting in erroneous output values. To
*        avoid this, users are recommended to use an area preserving
*        projection (such as AITOFF or LAMBERT, see parameter PROJTYPE)
*        in these cases.                                        [MJy/sr]
*     VAROUT = LITERAL (Read)
*        VAROUT specifies the type of output variances which are to be
*        calculated. These variances represent the uncertainty in each
*        pixel value in the output image, and are stored in the
*        VARIANCE component of the output NDF. Legal values for VAROUT
*        are INTERNAL, EXTERNAL or NONE. External is only allowed if
*        all the input CRDD files have associated VARIANCE components.
*        If EXTERNAL is specified, these externally calculated
*        variances are used as the basis for the calculation of output
*        variances.  If INTERNAL is specified, then the output
*        variances are estimated internally from the spread of CRDD
*        samples contributing to each output pixel. Users must be aware
*        of the warnings about such variances contained in the "Notes"
*        section below. A value of NONE for VAROUT causes no output
*        variances to be calculated, with a corresponding reduction in
*        run time.  If all input CRDD files have VARIANCES components,
*        then the run-time default for VAROUT is EXTERNAL. Otherwise
*        the run-time default is NONE.                                []
*     WEIGHT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If WEIGHT is set to a true value, then the total weight
*        assigned to each input data sample will be proportional to the
*        reciprocal of the sample variance value stored in the input
*        CRDD file. If WEIGHT is false, each full size detector sample
*        will have a total weight of unity (smaller detectors have
*        lower weight because they influence fewer pixels). If any
*        input CRDD files do not contain variance values then WEIGHT is
*        always given a false value.  Care should be taken when using
*        this option because bright samples usually have larger
*        variances.  Selecting this option would therefore cause small,
*        bright sources to be given lower weight than the surrounding
*        background regions, resulting in sources being made
*        systematically fainter.                                 [FALSE]

*  Examples:
*     MAPCRDD ^M51_SCANS M51_B1 COORDS=ECL ORIENT=10 HISTORY
*              QEXP=SOURCE.AND..NOT.SATURATED EXCLUDE=26-27
*
*        This will take the CRDD files listed in text file
*        M51_SCANS.DAT and produce an output map in M51_B1.SDF. The
*        output map will be oriented 10 degrees east of ecliptic north.
*        Only data from detector #47 with quality satisfying the
*        expression SOURCE.AND..NOT. SATURATED will be included in the
*        map. The quality names SOURCE and SATURATED must be set up by
*        the user using the application SETQUAL). The output MAP
*        includes a HISTORY component.

*  The Mapping Process:
*     A CRDD sample value represents the integrated flux over some
*     small area of the sky (defined by the detector Point Spread
*     Function).  When a sample value is divided by the detectors
*     effective solid angle, it becomes a surface brightness estimate.
*     Each pixel value in the output image is formed as the weighted
*     mean of all the sample surface brightness values in the
*     neighbourhood of the pixel. MAPCRDD provides two different
*     weighting schemes:
*
*     1) The sample has a constant weight at all pixels lying within
*     the area covered by the relevant detector mask at the moment the
*     sample was taken. The sample has zero weight at all other pixels.
*
*     2) The sample has a weight which varies as a Gaussian with the
*     distance between the detector centre and the pixel. The weights
*     are truncated to zero at the edges of the detector mask. The
*     Gaussian can have different widths in the in-scan and cross-scan
*     directions (see parameter FWHM).
*
*     The user can specify which scheme to use by means of the
*     parameter GAUSSIAN. Scheme 1 is very slightly faster, but scheme
*     2 results in less striping in the output image, and somewhat
*     higher resolution.
*
*     The algorithm proceeds for each data sample by first finding the
*     centre of the detector within the output image. The area covered
*     by the detector is then divided into rectangular "sectors" (see
*     parameter SECSIZE).  The sample weight within each sector is
*     found (it is considered to be constant across the sector), and
*     multiplied by the sample value. The output pixel closest to the
*     sector centre is found, and two images modified at that pixel.
*     The first image holds the sum of the weighted data samples
*     (expressed as surface brightness values), and the second hold the
*     sum of the weights. After this has been done for all data
*     samples, the first image is divided by the second.  Any pixels
*     which have zero weight are set to the "bad" value.  Each output
*     pixel value is thus the weighted mean of the neighbouring data
*     samples.

*  Reducing the Impact of Poor Data:
*     By default, each full size detector sample has a total weight of
*     unity (smaller detectors have lower weight because they influence
*     fewer pixels).  However, if all input data have associated
*     variance estimates, there is an option (see parameter WEIGHT) for
*     giving each sample a total weight proportional to the reciprocal
*     of the sample's variance. It should be borne in mind that
*     brighter samples usually have larger variances, so this option
*     will give lower weight to brighter samples, thus (for instance)
*     systematically lowering point source fluxes. Samples with zero
*     variance are treated like bad pixels if this option is selected.

*  Estimating the Noise in the Output Image:
*     If the input sample values have associated variance values, then
*     formal variance values can be defined for the output pixel values
*     (albeit these variance values will be correlated because of the
*     mapping algorithm). This is done by forming a third image holding
*     the sum of the weighted input variance values. The weights used
*     in this image are the square of the weights used in the first
*     image. The final variances are formed by dividing this third
*     image by the square of the second image. These variances represent
*     the expected error between the "true" sky AFTER CONVOLUTION WITH
*     THE DETECTOR PSFS, and the calculated surface brightness image.
*     It should be remembered that Starlink software assumes that the
*     NDF VARIANCE component holds variances related to independent,
*     Gaussian errors. This is not the case with IRAS data, so the
*     variance values should not be relied on too heavily.
*
*     There is an option for creating output variance values based on
*     the spread of input sample values at each pixel, rather than on
*     the variance value stored for each input sample (see parameter
*     VAROUT).  This facility allows output variances to be produced
*     even when the input CRDD files do not have any associated
*     variances. However, it must be emphasised that these variance
*     estimates include a contribution caused by spatial structure in
*     the image. For instance, the spread in input data values
*     contributing to an output pixel which is close to a bright point
*     source, will be completely dominated by the real variations
*     caused by the point source. They will have only a relatively
*     small contribution from the variations caused by noise. Caution
*     should therefore be shown when using these "internally
*     calculated" variance estimates.  Having said that, one benefit of
*     using internal variance values, is that the resulting output
*     variances will automatically include noise caused by residual
*     striping in the input data. This will not usually be the case if
*     input variance values are used. (This depends on how the input
*     variances were calculated.)

*  Colour Correction and Output Units:
*     The output image pixel values are not colour corrected and can be
*     in one of several different systems of units. The available units
*     are described in the help on "Data_units". The detector effective
*     solid angles and bandwidths used to produce the output values are
*     listed in the help on "Detector_solid_angles" and
*     "Detector_bandwidths". These values are also written to the
*     HISTORY component of the output NDF (see parameter HISTORY).
