      SUBROUTINE POINTCRDD( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     POINTCRDD

*  Purpose:
*     Detects point sources along the detector trace(s) of CRDD NDF file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POINTCRDD( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application is designed to detect point sources along the
*     data traces of CRDD or CRDD-like NDF's (e.g. the outputs of
*     COADDCRDD, etc. ) files.
*
*     The application will run in two modes, in non-automatic mode it will
*     prompt the user for an expected source position, by default this will
*     be the reference position of the scan. If the user accepts or enters
*     a position the search for the point sources will be performed along a
*     segment of the detector trace nearest to this expected source position.
*     The two values SCAN_NORTH and SCAN_SOUTH are the lengths north and south
*     of the source position to be used. If there is more than one detector
*     the user is then also prompted for the detectors to use, which can
*     be nearest, choose or all. If the user selects choose the detectors and
*     their cross-scan distances will be presented and the user can accept or
*     reject each. If the user enters null '!' to the source position the
*     application will assume the full scan length should be searched for
*     all detectors.
*
*     If the application is run in automatic mode, the application assumes
*     the reference position as the expected source position, the scan lengths
*     as 40 arcminutes each, and the nearest detector.
*
*     The source detection consists of the following steps
*     For each detector trace
*     i)   The overall noise is calculated for the scanlength specified
*          or the whole scan. This includes an iterative proceedure
*          which rejects samples more than THRESH_SD times the standard
*          deviation from the average.
*     ii)  A zero sum filter is applied sucessively around each sample
*          point. The filter adds a few samples centered at this point, where
*          the strongest signal would be found if one was there, and subtracts
*          a compensating number of outlying samples, so that if there is
*          no signal the value would be approximately zero.
*     iii) The mean and standard deviation of the filter output is calculated,
*          again rejecting values more than THRESH_SD times the standard
*          deviation from average.
*     iv)  The filter values are examined and any which are THRESH_FILTER
*          times the standard deviation are selected as candidate point
*          source positions.
*     v)   For each candidate position the correlation coefficient between
*          the samples surrounding the position and the point source profile
*          for an average detector in that band is calculated. If the
*          correlation coefficient is greater than THRESH_CORR, the candidate
*          is accepted.
*     vi)  The local noise around the candidate source is calculated. The
*          range of samples used is two sections each of length NOISE_SMPL
*          on either side of a point source profile centered at the
*          candidate position. Again the samples are iteratively rejected if
*          they lie outside THRESH_SD standard deviations. If more than 25%
*          of the sample are bad or rejected the range is extended to provide
*          the neccessary 75%.
*     vii) A final test of the candidate position is applied. The signal at
*          the position is compared with the local noise and it accepted as
*          a point source if it exceeds THRESH_S2N times the local noise.
*          If THRESH_S2N is given the null value '!' this test will not be
*          applied and all candidates will be reported.
*
*     The output results consist of three sections, the detection parameter
*     values used, details of the scan, and details of each source.
*     For each scan the details include the scan name, details of the expected
*     source position, scan length and detectors used, and the mean sample
*     value and noise value calculated together with the number of samples
*     used in this calcuation.
*     The information given for each point source includes its position,
*     in-scan and cross-scan position relative to the expected point source
*     position if given, average background, slope and local noise (including
*     the number of samples used in calculating the noise), and the
*     signal to noise ratio and correlation coefficient.
*
*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AUTOMATIC = LOGICAL (Read)
*        If AUTOMATIC is true the application assumes the expected source
*        position is the reference position, the scan to be searched is 40
*        arcmin on either side of this position, and the nearest detector
*        is to be used.

*        the minimum crossscan distance from the expected source position
*        is used. If choice is entered then detectors are chosen as described
