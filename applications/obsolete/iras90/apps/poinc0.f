      SUBROUTINE POINC0( NPSMP, NPROF, DATA, AXIS, BAND, PRFWID, PPROF,
     :                   STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     POINC0

*  Purpose:
*     Re-sample the input point source profile.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POINC0( NPSMP, NPROF, DATA, AXIS, BAND, PRFWID, PPROF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine is used by POINTCRDD to re-sample an ideal
*     point source profile associated with the given waveband at the
*     same rate as the IRAS data scans. The non-zero segment of the
*     result is put into a temporary working array and the pointer to
*     its first element is returned.  

*  Arguments:
*     NPSMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of samples in the input ideal point source profile data
*        array.
*     NPROF = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of profile in the input ideal point source profile data
*        array.
*     DATA( NPSMP, NPROF ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input ideal point source profile data array. 
*     AXIS( NPSMP ) = REAL (Given)
*        The in-scan axis of the point source profile, in arc-min from
*        its centre.
*     BAND = INTEGER (Given)
*        Waveband number with which the associated point source profile
*        is to be re-sampled.
*     PRFWID = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the samples in the non-zero segment of the
*        re-sampled point source profile associated with the given
*        waveband.
*     PPROF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Pointer to the first element of a temporary working array which
*        contains the non-zero segment of the re-sampled point source
*        profile associated with the given waveband.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
