      SUBROUTINE SPOSA0( PARAM, IGRP, COORDS, GOTSKY, SIZE, FILE,
     :                   LFILE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPOSA0

*  Purpose:
*     Read the contents of a text file into a group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPOSA0( PARAM, IGRP, COORDS, GOTSKY, SIZE, FILE, LFILE, 
*                  STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied parameter is used to get the name of a text file from
*     the environment. The contents of the file are then read into a GRP
*     group by specifying the file name within an indirection element of
*     a group expression. If an error occurs trying to read the file,
*     the user is re-prompted for a new file. Once a file has been read
*     into a group, the first element of the group is examined. If it is
*     the name of a valid IRA sky coordinate system, then this value is 
*     returned in COORDS and GOTSKY is returned true (in this case the
*     first element is excluded from the returned group). If it is a 
*     numerical value, the value "IMAGE COORDINATES" is returned in 
*     COORDS and GOTSKY is returned false. If neither of these cases
*     holds, an error is reported. 

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter to use.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP identifier for a group containing the files contents.
*     COORDS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The system in which the coordinates are stored in the text
*        file.
*     GOTSKY = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if the text file holds sky coordinates, false if it holds
*        image coordinates.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The size of the returned group.
*     FILE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The name of the text file.
*     LFILE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Used length of FILE.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
