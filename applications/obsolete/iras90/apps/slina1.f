*  Purpose:
*     Interactively draw curves in current SGS zone.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SLINA1( PNTYPE, PNLON, PNLAT, PNARC, PNANG, MODE,
*                  IRA, SCS, LBND, UBND, MXNSCT,

*  Description:
*     This subroutine is called by SKYLINE to draw various curves in
*     the current SGS zone. The curve types include:
*
*       MERIDIAN - Draw a meridian section.
*
*       PARALLEL - Draw a parallel section.
*
*       GREAT CIRCLE - Draw a great circle section.
*
*       POLYLINE - Draw a polyline.
*
*     The routine will keep prompting for the specification of a new
*     curve until a null, '!', is obtained in keyboard mode or a cursor
*     position outside the image is obtained in cursor mode, and keep
*     prompt for a new type after the previous type is finish until a
*     null, '!', is obtained.
