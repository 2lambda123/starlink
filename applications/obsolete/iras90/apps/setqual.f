      SUBROUTINE SETQUAL( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SETQUAL

*  Purpose:
*     Assign a specified quality to selected pixels within a group of
*     NDFs.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SETQUAL( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine assigns (or optionally removes) the quality
*     specified by parameter QNAME to (or from) selected pixels in each
*     NDF specified by parameter NDF. For more information about using
*     quality within the IRAS90 package see the help on
*     "Quality_in_IRAS90".
*
*     The user can select the pixels to be operated on in one of three
*     ways (see parameter SELECT):
*
*     1) By giving a group of `mask' NDFs (one for each input NDF).
*     Pixels with bad values in the mask NDFs will be selected from the
*     corresponding input NDFs.
*
*     2) By giving a list of pixel indices for the pixels which are to
*     be selected (a single list is provided which is used for all input
*     NDFs).
*
*     3) By giving an ``ARD description'' for the regions of the NDFs
*     which are to be selected. The ARD system (see SUN/183) uses a
*     textual language to describe geometric regions of an array. Text
*     files containing ARD description suitable for use with this
*     routine can be created interactively using the KAPPA routine
*     ARDGEN.
*
*     The operation to be performed on the pixels is specified by
*     parameter FUNCTION. The given quality may be assigned to or
*     removed from pixels within the NDFs. The pixels operated on
*     can either be those selected by the user (as described above),
*     or those not selected.  The quality of all other pixels is left
*     unchanged (unless the parameter FUNCTION is given the value NS+HU
*     or NU+HS). Thus for instance if pixel (1,1) already held the
*     quality specified by QNAME, and the quality was then assigned to
*     pixel (2,2) this would not cause the quality to be removed from
*     pixel (1,1).
*
*     All the input NDFs are presumed to be aligned with each other, but
*     can be of different extent (but they must all have the same number
*     of dimensions).

*  Usage:
*     SETQUAL NDF QNAME COMMENT MASK 

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ARD = LITERAL (Read)
*        An ARD description for the `selected' regions of the input
*        NDFs.  This should be supplied in the form of a group
*        expression (see help on "Group Expressions"). See SUN/183 or
*        KAPPA:ARDGEN for further details of the syntax of an ARD
*        description.  This routine expects positions within the ARD
*        description to be given in terms of pixel co-ordinates. The
*        same ARD description is used for all input NDFs.  The ARD
*        parameter is only prompted for if the SELECT parameter is
*        given the value "ARD".
*     COMMENT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A comment to store with the quality name.  This parameter is
*        only prompted for if an NDF does not already contain a
*        definition of the quality name.  The same comment is used for
*        any other subsequent NDFs which do not contain a definition of
*        the quality name.
*     FUNCTION = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter specifies what function is to be performed on
*        the "selected" pixels specified using parameters MASK, LIST or
*        ARD. It can take any of the values "HS", "HU", "NS", "NU",
*        "HS+NU" or "HU+NS"
*
*        HS - Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is held by
*             all the selected pixels. The quality of all other
*             pixels is left un-changed.
*
*        HU - Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is held by all
*             the pixels which have not been selected. The quality of
*             the selected pixels is left un-changed.
*
*        NS - Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is not held by
*             any of the selected pixels. The quality of all other
*             pixels is left un-changed.
*
*        NU - Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is not held by
*             any of the pixels which have not been selected. The
*             quality of the selected pixels is left un-changed.
*
*        HS+NU - Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is held by
*             all the selected pixels and not held by any of the other
*             pixels.
*
*        HU+NS - Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is held by
*             all the pixels which have not been selected and not held
*             by any of the selected pixels.
*                                                                   [HS]
*     HISTORY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Determines if history information is to be added to the NDFs.
*        See help on "History_in_IRAS90" for more information on
*        history.                              [current history setting]
*     LIST = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of the pixels within the input NDFs which are to be
*        `selected' (see parameter FUNCTION). This should be in the
*        form of a group expression (see help on "Group_expressions")
*        giving a list of pixel indices (eg X1, Y1, X2, Y2,...  for a
*        two dimensional NDF). The same list is used for all input
*        NDFs.  LIST is only prompted for if parameter SELECT is given
*        the value LIST.
*     MASK = NDF (Read)
*        A group of mask NDFs. Each mask is used to define the
*        `selected' pixels within the corresponding input NDF (see
*        parameter FUNCTION). The masks should be aligned
*        pixel-for-pixel with the input NDFs.  Pixels which are bad in
*        the mask NDFs are `selected'. The quality of any pixels which
*        lie outside the bounds of the corresponding mask NDF is left
*        unaltered.  This parameter is only prompted for if the
*        parameter SELECT is given the value MASK.
*     MSG_FILTER = LITERAL (Read)
*        The level of information displayed on the users screen. This
*        should take one of the values QUIET, NORMAL or VERBOSE (see
*        help on "Message_filtering").
*                                       [current message filter setting]
*     NDF = NDF (Update)
*        A group of NDFs in which the quality information is to be
*        stored. This should be in the form of a group expression (see
*        help on "Group_expresssions"). 
*     QNAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        The quality name. If the supplied name is not already defined
*        within any of the input NDFs, then a definition of the name is
*        added to the NDF. The user is warned if the quality name is
*        already defined within any of the NDFs.
*     SELECT = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter determines how the pixels are selected, and can
*        take the values MASK, LIST or ARD (see parameters MASK, LIST
*        and ARD).
*                                                                 [MASK]
*     XNAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        If an NDF already contains any quality name definitions then
*        new quality names are put in the same extension as the old
*        names.  If no previous quality names have been stored in the
*        NDF then parameter XNAME will be used to obtain the name of an
*        NDF extension in which to store the new quality name.  The
*        extension will be created if it does not already exist (see
*        parameter XTYPE). The same extension is used for all input
*        NDFs.                                           [QUALITY_NAMES]
*     XTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        If a new NDF extension is created to hold quality names (see
*        parameter XNAME), then parameter XTYPE is used to obtain the
*        HDS data type for the created extension. The run time default
*        is to give the extension a type identical to its name.       []

*  Examples:
*     SETQUAL M51 SATURATED "Saturated pixels" M51_CUT
*        This example ensures that the quality "SATURATED" is defined
*        within the NDF "M51". The comment "Saturated pixels" is stored
*        with the quality name if it did not already exist in the NDF.
*        The quality SATURATED is then assigned to all pixels for which
*        the corresponding pixel in NDF M51_CUT is bad. The quality of
*        all other pixels is left unchanged.
*
*     SETQUAL "M51,CENA" SOURCE_A SELECT=LIST LIST=^SOURCE_A.LIS FUNCTION=HS+NU
*        This example ensures that pixels within the two NDFs M51 and
*        CENA which are included in the list of pixel indices held in
*        text file SOURCE_A.LIS, have the quality "SOURCE_A", and also
*        ensures that none of the pixels which were not included in
*        SOURCE_A.LIS have the quality.
*
*     SETQUAL M51 SOURCE_B SELECT=ARD ARD="CIR(80,80,9).AND.CIR(70,70,7)"
*        This example ensures that all pixels within the region of
*        intersection of two circles have the quality "SOURCE_B". The
*        first circle is centred on pixel co-ordinates (80,80) and has
*        a radius of 9 pixels. The second circle is centred at (70,70)
*        and has a radius of 7 pixels.
*
*     SETQUAL M51 SOURCE_B SELECT=ARD ARD=^BACKGROUND.ARD
*        This example assigns the quality "SOURCE_B" to pixels of the
*        NDF "M51" as described by an ARD description stored in the text
*        file "BACKGROUND.ARD". This text file could for instance have
*        been created using KAPPA routine ARDGEN.

*  Notes:
*     -  All the quality names which are currently defined within an
*     NDF can be listed by application SHOWQUAL.  Quality name
*     definitions can be removed from an NDF using application REMQUAL.
*     If there is no room for any more quality names to be added to the
*     NDF then REMQUAL can be used to remove a quality name in order to
*     make room for the new quality names.
*
*     -  Only the QUALITY and (optionally) HISTORY components, and the
*     extension specified by parameter XNAME are altered by this
*     application. All other NDF components remain unaltered.
