      SUBROUTINE IFLDZ2(RA, DEC, SIZE, RACNR, DECCNR, STATUS)
*+

*  Name:
*     IFLDZ2

*  Purpose:
*     Calculates the coordinates of the 4 corners of a box

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of module:
*     Subroutine to an ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IFLDZ2(RA, DEC, SIZE, RACNR, DECCNR, STATUS)

*  Description:
*     This routine takes as input equatorial coordinate and a box
*     size, and returns the coordinates of the 4 corners of the box,
*     centred on the input coordinate.
*     The indices of the corners are as follows:
*          C1    C3
*
*             C
*
*          C2    C4

*  Notes:
*     This routine uses the sla_lib routine SLA_DTP2S to translate from the
*     box size which is on the tangent plane at the specified RA and Dec, to
*     the spherical equivalent. If one were to give the SLA_DTP2S routine a 
*     box size of 1 degree it would take this as if it were at the equator, 
*     it would give spherical coordinate extremities of 4deg RA x 1deg Dec at
*     a Dec of 75deg (nb. cos(75)=.25). Though this is technically correct 
*     we felt that users were likely to want a box of approx 1deg square at
*     75deg Dec and therefore the RA size is multiplied by cos(dec) in each
*     case.

*  Parameters:
*     RA = DOUBLEPRECISION (Read)
*       The RA of the input coordinate in equatorial radians.
*
*     DEC = DOUBLEPRECISION (Read)
*       The DEC of the input coordinate in equatorial radians.
*
*     SIZE = DOUBLEPRECISION (Read)
*       The box size in radians.
*
*     RACNR = DOUBLEPRECISION(4) (Write)
*       The RA of the 4 corners in equatorial radians.
*
*     DECCNR = DOUBLEPRECISION(4) (Write)
*       The DEC of the 4 corners in equatorial radians.
*
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Read/Write)
*       The global status.

*  Check global status

*  Calculate the cartesian coordinates of the 4 corners
       DO I = 0, 1
         DO J = 0, 1

           INDEX = (I*2) + J + 1            ! The index of the current corner

*  If in the northern hemisphere, the axes are reversed
           IF (DEC .GT. 0.0) INDEX = 5 - INDEX

*  Get the cartesian coordinates of the corners
           I2 = ( (I * SIZE) - (SIZE / 2.0) ) * COS( DEC )
           J2 = (J * SIZE) - (SIZE / 2.0)

*  Use SLA_DTP2S to transform the tangent plane coordinates to spherical 
*  coordinates
           CALL SLA_DTP2S( I2, J2, RA, DEC, RATMP, DECTMP )

*  Normalise the RA into 0-2PI

*  Normalise the DEC into +-PI
