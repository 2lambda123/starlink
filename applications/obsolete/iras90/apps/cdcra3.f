      SUBROUTINE CDCRA3( PWGHT, PDIST, PGV, NCRDD, NDFID, WEIGHT, DIST,
     :                   GVDTEG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CDCRA3

*  Purpose:
*     Get the way to weight the traces when coadding.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CDCRA3( PWGHT, PDIST, PGV, NCRDD, NDFID, WEIGHT, DIST,
*                  GVDTEG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine is used to get the weighting method to be used to
*     weight the traces when coadding. The basic weighting choices are:
*     Variance weighting (if all input CRDD NDFs contain variance
*     components ), NEFD weighting and Equal weighting. In addition,
*     these weighting methods can be combined with the distance
*     weighting which weights the detectors via a Gaussian function
*     according to the distance of the detector centre to the source
*     position (a detector acrossing the source at its centre will have
*     distance weighting 1.0 ). If distance weighting is selected, the
*     user will be prompted for the value of the Gaussian function at
*     the edge of the detector. 

*  Arguments:
*     PWGHT = CHARACTER*( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter used to get the method to weight the
*        traces to be coadded.     
*     PDIST = CHARACTER*( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter used to see if the distance weighting
*        will be combined with the other weighting methods.
*     PGV = CHARACTER*( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter used when the distance weighting will
*        be used to get the value of the Guassian function at the edge
*        of a detector. 
*     NCRDD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of input CRDD NDFs.
*     NDFID( NCRDD ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        NDF id of the input CRDD NDFs.
*     WEIGHT = CHARACTER*( * ) (Returned)
*        The weighting method selected by the user.
*     DIST = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true, the distance weighting will be combined with the other
*        weighting method.
*     GVDTEG = REAL (Returned)
*        The value of the Gaussian weighting function at the edge of a
*        detector when distance weighting is used.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
