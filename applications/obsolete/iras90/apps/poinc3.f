      SUBROUTINE POINC3( YP, Y, YL, MAXVAL, MAXPOS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     POINC3

*  Purpose:
*     Find max by parabola interpolation of three known points.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POINC3( YP, Y, YL, MAXVAL, MAXPOS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine fits three known points with a parabola:
*              Y = A * X^2 + B * X + C
*     and find the max. value and position of this parabola with in the
*     range of these three know points. It assumes that the known point 
*     YP, Y and YL have X coordinates -1, 0 and 1, respectively. The 
*     position of the max. value is returned in this coordinate.

*  Arguments:
*     YP, Y, YL = REAL (Given)
*        The known values at position -1, 0 and 1, respectively.
*     MAXVAL = REAL (Returned)
*        The max. of the parabola.
*     MAXPOS = REAL (Returned)
*        The position of the min.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  If A is negative, there is a max. find its position.

*  If it is inside the range of known points, find the max. value.
