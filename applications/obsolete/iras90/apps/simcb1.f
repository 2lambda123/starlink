      SUBROUTINE SIMCB1( IGRP, DETNO, LBND, UBND, C, PNTR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SIMCB1

*  Purpose:
*     Return information about a detector PSF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SIMCB1( IGRP, DETNO, LBND, UBND, C, PNTR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The names of the NDFs containing the PSFs are supplied in the
*     group identified by IGRP. Element N of the group should contain
*     the name of the NDF which holds the PSF for detector #N. If this
*     NDF cannot be access an error is reported and no further action
*     takes place. If the NDF can be accessed, then the required
*     information is obtained and returned to the calling routine. It is
*     also stored in some internal arrays, so that if the PSF is
*     required again, the information does not need to be obtained from
*     scratch. The NDF is kept open by storing the NDF identifier in one
*     of the internal arrays. These internal arrays have room for 16
*     detectors to be stored simultaneously. If more than 16 PSFs are
*     needed, then the oldest PSF is closed and the slot in the arrays
*     used to store its information is made available for a new PSF.
*
*     Before accessing any PSF, this routine should be called with DETNO
*     set to zero, which causes all the internal arrays and pointers to
*     be initialised. Once all access to the PSFs is complete, this
*     routine should be called with DETNO set to a negative value, which
*     causes all NDFs currently being accessed to be closed.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the group holding the names of the NDFs
*        containing the detector PSFs.
*     DETNO = INTEGER (Given)
*        The detector number for which a PSF is reqired (1-62). If a
*        value of zero is supplied, then the internal arrays are
*        initialised, and all other arguments are ignored. If a
*        negative value is supplied, then the all PSF NDFs are closed,
*        and all other arguments are ignored.
*     LBND( 2 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The lower bounds of the PSF.
*     UBND( 2 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The upper bounds of the PSF.
*     C( 6 ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The coefficients of the linear transformation:
*
*        DZ = C1 + C2*I + C3*J
*        DY = C4 + C5*I + C6*J
*
*        where DZ is the offset parallel to the focal plane Z axis, from
*        the detector centre to the centre of the PSF pixel (I,J) (in
*        radians). DY is the offset parallel to the focal plane Y axis.
*     PNTR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to the mapped data array of the NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
