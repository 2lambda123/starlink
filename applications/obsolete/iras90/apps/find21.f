*  Name:

*     acceptance criteria for a source, and to set up crosslinkages
*     between the scan data and the source data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FIND21( IOBS, ISOP, ISOURC, OBNSQ, OBPSR, OBTH, SLPSI,

*  Description:
*     To store data for a scan that has been found to satisfy find scan
*     acceptance criteria for a source, and to set up crosslinkages
*     between the scan data and the source data.
*     
*     - Store scan details in scan common, this includes:-
*        Updating the number of scans stored in scan common.
*        Enter a cross reference to the source details in the scan
*        record.
*        Enter a cross reference to the scan number in scan common in
*        the source record, and increment the number of scans found for
*        this source.
*        Entering SOP number and observation number in the scan record.
*        Storing the difference between source theta and scan theta as
*        the cross scan displacement.
*        Storing the scan theta.
*        Calculating and storing the satcal crossing time, psi, and
*        solar longitude, of the start and end of the scan length
*        required and the nearest point at which the scan passes the
*        source.
*        Transforming the start scan time and end scan time, from
*        satcal time to UTCS using FIND42. ( A time translation
*        allowance of TITRAL is added to either end of the scan lenght

*  Notes:
*  Notes on testing of subroutine on GCASS data
*  The data entered was as follows
*   Source     Coord             Position               Region size
*    Name       Sys      1st Coord       2nd Coord    Inscan  Xscan    
*  GAMMACAS   Eq'50    00 55 00.00     60 40 00.00    120.0   20.0     
*
*     -  CROSS SCAN SIZE recorded in scan common
*     For GCASS the x scan offset between source and observation 11 of
*     SOP 381 was -6.2104 radians, when this is translated to arcmin
*     it gives -21.3497 which compares with the SNIP_CRDD x scan value
*     for this SOP of -21.4.
*
*     -  IN SCAN size recorded in scan common
*     For observation 11 of SOP 381 the psi of the nearest scan point
*     to the source is 0.7169860 radians, and the source crossing takes
*     place at 16476379.4200 satcal secs.
*
*     The inscan value entered is 120 arc min which gives a half
*     inscan distance in radians of 0.017453292. The rate at which the
*     satellite was tracking was 3.849 arc secs per satcal sec, this
*     gives a radian rate of 0.0011196623 radians per satcal sec (the
*     data value being given in the SPFARCH file).
*
*     Therefore the satcal sec taken to cover this half in scan length
*     is 0.017453292 / 0.0011196623 = 15.588000 . This is then
*     translated to true secs (see below) giving 15.588000 / 1.000054
*     = 15.58715829. The satcal start of scan time is then 16476379.4200
*     - 15.58715829 = 16476363.8328. The satcal end of scan time is then
*     16476379.4200 + 15.58715829 = 16476395.0071.
*
*     -  Translation of secs to satcal.
*     The SATCAL clock gained 3.5 secs per day relative to real secs.
*     Therefore we expect more satcal "secs" for a given number of real
*     secs. Therefore satcal "secs" = secs * 1.000054(approx) (the data
*     value being given in the SPFARCH file).
