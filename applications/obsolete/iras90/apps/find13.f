*  Name:
*     FIND13

*  Purpose:
*     Edits one or many existing sources in a list of sources.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FIND13( CONREQ, ILEVEL, MAXLEN, PCONAD, PEDNAM, PSCOR1,
*     :     PSCOR2, PSCOSY, PSNAME, PSTITL, SCS, MENU, SOPOS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Edits one or many existing sources in a list of sources.
*     The user is asked for the name of the source he wishes to edit.
*     This is truncated to 8 characters and changed to upper case, as
*     well as being checked that it is a valid prefix for a file name.
*     The routine searches through the source list and presents to the
*     user all sources whos name matches the one he has specified.
*     For each source name found the routine FIND02 is called to edit
*     the details of the source position etc. If the user does not
*     want to edit this particular source he should enter ! to a
*     parameter request within FIND02. FIND02 will return to this
*     subroutine and the next source with the same name will be found.
*     If the source list is searched and no source with the name the
*     user has specified is found the program will inform the user.     
*     The process is repeated until the user enters a ! for the
*     filename.
*     The program lists the last page of the source list (if ILEVEL = 2
*     or 4 ) The routine returns to FIND25 and the user is then given
*     the edit sources menu.
*     
*  Arguments:
*     CONREQ = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Set .TRUE. if added, and edited, sources are to be confirmed

*        source has correct details
*     PEDNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter EDITSOURCENAME for source name to be edited

*     PSCOR2 = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter SOURCECOORD2 for second coordinate of source position
*     PSCOSY = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter SOURCECOORDSYS for coordinate system in which source
*        positions are given
*     PSNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter SOURCENAME for source name to be used in EXCRDD file
*        names
*     PSTITL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter SOURCETITLE for title of source for headings
*     SCS = CHARACTER * ( IRA__SZSCS ) (Given)
*        Value of Coordinate system
*     MENU = CHARACTER * ( 1 )  (Given and Returned)
*        Choice from edit_data menu
*     SOPOS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to position in source common in which source is to
*        be entered
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
