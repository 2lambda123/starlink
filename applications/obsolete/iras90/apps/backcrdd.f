      SUBROUTINE BACKCRDD( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     BACKCRDD

*  Purpose:
*     Estimate and remove backgrounds from a group of CRDD files.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL BACKCRDD( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine estimates and removes a variety of different
*     backgrounds from a group of CRDD files. An output CRDD file is
*     produced for each input CRDD file. Depending on the value of
*     parameter OUTTYPE, this output CRDD file will hold either the
*     input data with the estimated background subtracted from it, or
*     the estimated background data itself. The type of background used
*     is specified by parameter TYPE. The mean background surface
*     brightness in the data after background subtraction can be
*     controlled using parameter OUTBACK. This may for instance be
*     given the value of the mean background surface brightness
*     calculated by routine DESTCRDD, in which case the mean background
*     in the data would be preserved.
*
*     Only the DATA component of each NDF is modified by this routine;
*     all other components are copied to the output without change. The
*     exception to this is that any output VARIANCE component is deleted
*     if parameter OUTTYPE had the value BACKGROUND.

*  Usage:
*     BACKCRDD IN OUT

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     CLIP = _REAL (Read)
*        The number of standard deviations at which data will be
*        rejected.                                                 [3.0]
*     HISTORY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Determines if history information is to be stored within the
*        output CRDD files. See help on "History_in_IRAS90" for more
*        information on history.  The history information will contain
*        the names of the input CRDD files and BACKCRDD parameter
*        values.                               [current history setting]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        Specifies a group of input CRDD files. This should be in the
*        form of a group expression (see help on "Group_expressions").
*        The CRDD files must contain data from the same IRAS waveband.
*        There is no limit on the number of CRDD files which can be
*        specified.
*     MSG_FILTER = LITERAL (Read)
*        The level of information displayed on the users screen. This
*        should take one of the values QUIET, NORMAL or VERBOSE (see
*        help on "Message_filtering").
*                                       [current message filter setting]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        A group of output CRDD files corresponding one-for-one with
*        the list of input CRDD files given for parameter IN.  This
*        should be in the form of a group expression (see help on
*        "Group_expressions"). Expressions such as "*_BAK" are expanded
*        by replacing the "*" character with each input CRDD file in
*        turn.
*     OUTBACK = _REAL (Read)
*        The mean background surface brightness required in the data
*        after background subtraction. The same value is used for each
*        CRDD file. The value should be given in Mega-Janskys per
*        steradian.                                                [0.0]
*     OUTTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        This can take the values DATA and BACKGROUND. DATA causes the
*        output CRDD files to hold the background subtracted input data;
*        BACKGROUND causes the output CRDD files to hold the estimated
*        background data itself.                                  [DATA]
*     QEXP = LITERAL (Read)
*        A quality expression giving the quality of samples which are
*        to be included in the estimation of the backgrounds to be
*        subtracted from each CRDD file. A value of "ANY" causes all
*        samples to be used, without regard to quality.            [ANY]
*     QNAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of a quality to be assigned to all samples which do
*        not contribute to the estimation of the scan background.
*        Samples are omitted from the scan background calculations if
*        they are bad in the input NDF, do not satisfy the quality
*        expression given by parameter QEXP, or are rejected as source
*        samples by the cleaning algorithm. A blank value for QNAME
*        causes no quality values to be assigned.                     []
*     TYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The type of background to be subtracted from the input CRDD
*        files. Currently supported values are: UNIFORM, LINEAR.
*                                                              [UNIFORM]
*     XNAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        If any the input NDF do not already contain any quality name
*        definitions then new quality names are put in the extension
*        specified by XNAME. This extension is created if it does not
*        already exist.                                  [QUALITY_NAMES]
*     XTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        If any new NDF extensions are created to hold quality names
*        (see parameter XNAME), then parameter XTYPE is used to obtain
*        the HDS data type for the created extensions. The run time
*        default is to give the extension a type identical to its name.

*  Examples:
*     BACKCRDD ZCMA_B1S1_DS ZCMA_B1S1_BAK TYPE=UNIFORM
*        This command causes a constant background value to be
*        estimated for CRDD file ZCMA_B1S1_DS and the background
*        subtracted data to be stored in ZCMA_B1S1_BAK.
*     BACKCRDD *_DS *|_DS|_FIT| QEXP=.NOT.(SOURCE_A.OR.SOURCE_B) OUTTYPE=B
*        This command attempts to estimate linear backgrounds for all
*        NDFs in the current directory which have names ending with
*        "_DS". The estimated backgrounds are stored in corresponding
*        output NDFs in which "_DS" is replaced by "_FIT". Any samples
*        which have either of the two qualities SOURCE_A and/or
*        SOURCE_B are excluded from the estimation of the background.

*  Excluding Samples from the Background Estimate:
*     The user may choose to exclude certain samples from the
*     estimation of the background by giving a "quality expression" for
*     parameter QEXP. Only those samples which have qualities
*     satisfying the given quality expression are included in the
*     estimation of the background. Qualities can be assigned to
*     selected samples using routine SETQUAL.

*  Estimation of Uniform Backgrounds:
*     After removing samples which do not satisfy the quality
*     expression, the median surface brightness value in each CRDD file
*     is found (see help on "Detector_solid_angles" and
*     "Detector_bandwidths" for lists of the detector effective solid
*     angles and band widths used to convert between flux, flux density
*     and surface brightness values). An attempt is then made to
*     improve the fit to the background by iteratively removing any
*     outlying data values from the median estimation. This is done by
*     removing samples which lie further than a specified multiple of
*     the noise from the current median value (see parameter CLIP). The
*     noise is taken to be the RMS residual between the input data and
*     the current median value.  After rejecting these outlying
*     samples, a new median value is found. This rejection process is
*     repeated until the RMS residual changes by less than 0.1% between
*     iterations. The required output background surface brightness
*     (specified by parameter OUTBACK) is subtracted from the final
*     median value. This value is converted back to the same units as
*     the input CRDD to form the background estimate.

*  Estimation of Linear Backgrounds:
*     After removing samples which do not satisfy the quality
*     expression, the data is compressed in the cross-scan direction by
*     taking the median of the cross-scan surface brightness values at
*     a range of in-scan positions along the scan. This results in a
*     single dimensional array holding an estimate of the background
*     surface brightness at each in-scan position. A least squares
*     linear fit is then made to this data, and the RMS residual of the
*     data from the fit is found.  An attempt is then made to improve
*     the fit to the background by iteratively removing any outlying
*     data values from the estimation of the linear fit.  This is done
*     by removing samples which lie far from the current linear fit.
*     The threshold for rejection is the value of parameter CLIP times
*     the RMS residual from the current fit.  After rejecting these
*     outlying samples, a new linear fit is found. This rejection 
*     process is repeated until the RMS residual changes by less than 
*     0.1% between iterations. The required output background surface 
*     brightness (specified by parameter OUTBACK) is subtracted from 
*     the final fit. This fit is converted back to the same units as 
*     the input CRDD to form the background estimate.
