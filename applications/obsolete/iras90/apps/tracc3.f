*  Name:
*     TRACC3

*  Purpose:
*     Assign a quality to samples selected using the cursor.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRACC3( NDFIN, BSMP, ESMP, BDET, EDET, INSCN, DATA, NDISP,
*                  OFFSET, DTINDX, SCALE, XLMT, YLMT, IDC, PQNAME,
*                  PXNAME, PXTYPE, PQCOMM, PHIST, COLOUR, CURSOR,
*                  CLRBLK, SCNDIR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     If the graphic device does not have a cursor, or is not block
*     clearable, the routine will just report a message and return.
*     Otherwise, the user is asked to mark two diagonally opposite
*     corners of a box on the data window.  If either are outside the
*     data window, the routine quits.  Otherwise, the traces and
*     samples which are closest to the cursor is found and indicated.
*     A quality name is obtained from the environment. If the quality
*     name is not defined in the input NDF, then a definition of the
*     name is added. All samples which fall within the box defined by
*     the two corners selected using the cursor, are then assigned the
*     quality (all other samples are left unchanged).
*
*     Before calling this routine the AUTOGRAPH grid window should be
*     made to match the current SGS zone world coordinates, that is the
*     grid window should have the bounds (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0 ).
