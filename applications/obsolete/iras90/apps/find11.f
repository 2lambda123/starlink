      SUBROUTINE FIND11( ILEVEL, MAXLEN, PCONDE, PDENAM, MENU, SOPOS,
     : STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FIND11

*  Purpose:
*     To delete one, or several, sources from the current list

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FIND11( ILEVEL, MAXLEN, PCONDE, PDENAM, MENU, SOPOS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     To delete one, or several, sources from the current list
*     
*     The subroutine consists of two sections. The first marks sources
*     for deletion as directed by the user. A flag is set in each source
*     to mark those which are to be deleted. At this stage the user can
*     recover a deleted source by respecifying its name. The second
*     section is that in which the deletions actually take place.
*
*     The user is asked for the name of the source he wishes to delete.
*     This is truncated to 8 characters and changed to upper case, as
*     well as being checked that it is a valid prefix for a file name.
*     The routine searches through the source list and presents to the
*     user all sources whos name matches the one he has specified.
*     Details of the source are displayed to the user and he is asked
*     whether he wishes to delete this source. The subroutine will 
*     find and offer the user all the sources in the source list whos
*     name matches that he has specified. This is regardless of whether
*     the. source has already been marked for deletion and offers the
*     user the chance to reclaim any deleted by mistake.
*
*     If the source list is searched and no source with the name the
*     user has specified is found the program will inform the user.     
*     The process is repeated until the user enters a ! for the
*     sourcename.
*
*     The second section is that in which the deletions actually take
*     place. Entries lower down the source list are moved up to
*     overwrite sources marked for deletion. Entries left at the end of
*     the list are zeroised and the correct number of sources is
*     calculated.
*     
*     The program lists the last page of the source list (if ILEVEL = 2
*     or 4) The routine returns to FIND25 and the user is then given
*     the edit sources menu.

*  Arguments:
*     ILEVEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        Program interaction level
*     MAXLEN = INTEGER
*        Number of lines per page on display
*     PCONDE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter CONFIRMDELETE for confirmation source displayed is
*        to be deleted
*     PDENAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter DELETESOURCENAME for source name to be deleted
*     MENU = CHARACTER * ( 1 )  (Given and Returned)
*        Choice from edit_data menu
*     SOPOS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to position in source common in which source is to
*        be deleted
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*
