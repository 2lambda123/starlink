            SUBROUTINE FIND20( SPFNAM, STATUS )   
*+
*  Name:
*     FIND20

*  Purpose:
*  The subroutine tests each observation to see whether it passes
*  within the area required for each source position. If so parameters
*  defining the required subsection of it, ie. scan, are stored for
*  possible extraction.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FIND20( SPFNAM, STATUS )   

*  Description:
*  The subroutine tests each observation to see whether it passes
*  within the area required for each source position. If so parameters
*  defining the required subsection of it, ie. scan, are stored for
*  possible extraction.
*  
*  The subroutine uses the SPFARCH file which contains details of
*  scan parameters, but these differ sightly from those of the
*  Boresight file. This means that positions are sufficiently
*  accurate for selection but have to be refined in EXCRDD for
*  further processing.
*  
*  Arguments:
*     SPFNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter SPFARCHFILE for name of file containing the SDF
*        version of the SPFARCH positions archive catalogue      
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  
*  Notes:
*  Section 1
*     -  The problem is to check whether each scan crosses the required
*     area around a source position.
*     -  The positions traversed by a scan are described in satellite
*     angles so we must first calculate the satellite angles of the
*     source.(i.e. The satellite angles that IRAS would have had if it
*     were to have observed the source position). These are relative to
*     the sun's position at the time the SOP was taken. So we have to
*     find out where the Sun was when each observation was taken and
*     calculate the source satellite angles appropriate to each SOP.
*     -  Next we have to find the required area around the source
*     position. We have the users specified size in the crosscan and
*     inscan directions. (Inscan is measured along the scan path,
*     crosscan is the minimum distance from the scan to the source).
*     To this we add an allowance for the size of the focal plane.
*     The SOP/observation data are for the centre of the focal plane,
*     this means that if any detector crosses the users specified area
*     the observation will be selected.
*     -  Now we come to the main problem - Does the scan cross this
*     region? In fact we apply three progressively tighter criteria,
*     and those that cross are those that do not get rejected through
*     all three.
*     -  The first stage rejects a complete SOP if it does not meet the
*     constraints that IRAS should not point too far towards the Sun on
*     either a north_south or a south_north traverse.
*     -  The second stage is a loose comparison of the satellite angles
*     traversed in the observation, with a enlarged source required box.
*     Why is this a loose comparison? The problem is time. The actual
*     positions recorded in the scan are the satellite angles taken at
*     the time the observation was being made, ie relative to the
*     position of the Sun at the time the observation was made.
*     When we do our second stage comparison we calculate the
*     position of the source in 1983.5 ecliptic coords, and use the
*     position of the Sun at the beginning of the scan, to calculate
*     the source satellite angles. A bit of a mess! So when we find
*     that the scan meets this messy criterion we can also calculate
*     approximately when this crossing took place. We then recalculate
*     the source ecliptic coords, the position of the Sun, and from this
*     get a much better value of the source satellite angles. If the
*     scan still crosses the required area we can refine the crossing
*     time and repeat the process. If the scan still passes the
*     criterion on the third repeat it is accepted.
*
*  Section 2.
*  How do you calculate the Source satellite angles?
*     -  It involves using spherical triangles on a triangle whose
*     corners are the source position, the Sun position, and the north
*     ecliptic pole.
*     -  The source position relative to the Sun position is worked out
*     as the ecliptic position of the source minus that of the Sun. It
*     is assumed that the position of the Sun has a negligible solar
*     latitude, and that only the solar longitude needs to be
*     subtracted. In the first approximation the source ecliptic
*     position is taken at epoch 1983.5, and the solar longitude as
*     that of the start of the SOP. In the second and third iterations
*     we use a time calculated from the previous iteration. This
*     crossing time is the approximate time the satellite looked at the
*     source. It is calculated from the scan rate and the approximate
*     source satellite angles???????????. The source ecliptic position
*     is then calculated for this time. The Sun's position is
*     calculated from its position at the start of the scan and the
*     rate of change of its longitude. These figures are then fed into
*     the next iteration of the satellite angle calculation.
*     -  The spherical triangle then looks like this
*  
*
*                          North ecliptic pole
*                                / I
*                              / A I
*                         ac /     I
*                          /       I
*                 Source / C       I ab
*                        \         I
*                          \       I
*                         bc \     I
*                              \ B I
*                                \ I
*                                Sun
*      Given
*            A = Solar longitude - Source ecliptic longitude 
*           ab = Pi/2
*           ac = Pi/2 - Source ecliptic latitude
*      To be found
*           bc = Theta ( satellite Sun angle )
*            C = Psi ( satellite clock angle ) 
*
*
*  Section 3.
*  Let us describe in more detail the criteria the scan has to meet to
*  be accepted?
*     -  In the first stage a complete SOP is rejected if, to observe
*     the source, would mean that IRAS would be pointed too close to
*     the Sun on either the North-South or South-North traverse
*     ie IRAS has to be 90 deg from the Sun plus or minus 30 deg.
*     To determine whether this is so the Theta of the source is
*     calculated, using the solar longitude at the beginning of the SOP.
*     This is in radians. It is then tested to see whether it lies
*     between pi/3 and 2pi/3. If it is outside this range it is
*     rejected.  
*     -  In the second stage a scan is accepted if it meets two
*     criteria:-
*     First that the Scan's theta is within plus or minus a crosscan
*     range of the Source's theta. This crosscan range is half the user
*     specified cross scan extent, plus 1 deg. The 1 deg is composed of
*     half the width of the focal plane ( 0.27 deg = 0.0047 rads), and
*     an allowance for timing discrepancies ( 1.0 - 0.27 deg).
*     Second that the Source psi (clock angle) falls in the range of
*     clock angle covered by the scan. A scan for which part of the
*     region the user has specified is covered by the scan, but the
*     source or what would be the closest point does not, is rejected.
*     -  In the third stage the criteria are the same as in the second
*     stage except that the crosscan range is tightened by removing the
*     allowance for timing discrepancies.
*     
*  Section 4.
*  How do we access the data we need?
*     -  We need three types of data:-
*     -  The acceptance and rejection criteria described above, which
*     are determined partly from known parameters of the mission
*     geometry eg the size of the focal plane, and partly from inscan
*     and crosscan requirements specified by the user and made
*     available through the source common variables.
*     -  The ecliptic coordinates of the source position. These are
*     calculated from the source position specified by the user and
*     made available through the source common block. We also need the
*     time at which the ecliptic coordinates are to be calculated. This
*     is initially 1983.5. In subsequent iterations the crossing time
*     is calculated from data held in SPFARCH for the scan.
*     -  Details of the positions covered by each scan. The details of
*     this are held in the SPFARCH file.
*
*  Section 5.
*  What is the contents of the SPFARCH file?
*     -  The SPFARCH file is an SDF file prepared from the original
*     fortran direct access file. It consists of a set of SOP header
*     details of various types described below, written as vectors. And
*     several blocks containing observation details. These were
*     prepared by blocking together observations from consecutive SOPs
*     until a suitable number for output was reached (NOOBBL=600). As
*     the data on observations for a given SOP could start anywhere in a
*     block, the block number and position within the block for the
*     first observation associated with a SOP is also held in the SOP
*     header. Observation data for a SOP may start in one block and be
*     completed in the next.
*     
*     _  The data on positions covered in the IRAS mission is given in
*     the SPFARCH file. The original file was an indexed file
*     containing the following data.
*     i) A header record for each SOP
*     ii) Followed by one Observation data record for each observation
*     in the SOP.
*
*     -  The SOP header record consists of:-
*           Number of observations,
*           A data item that is not used,
*           Time of start of SOP in yrs, days, and secs,
*           SATCAL time at the start of the SOP and the SATCAL rate,
*           Solar longitude at the start of the SOP and Solar longitude
*              rate,
*           Two data items that are not used,
*           Direction of scan given as the sign of psi dot.
*     
*     -  The Observation data consists of:-
*           Observation identifier?,
*           Observation sequence number,
*           Satcal time of first measurements in the observation,
*           Satcal time of last measurements in the observation,
*           Satellite angle theta,
*           Uncertainty in satellite angle theta,
*           Satellite angle psi at the begining of the observation,
*           Uncertainty in satellite angle psi,
*           Rate of change of satellite angle psi,
*           Uncertainty in psi rate.

*     -  From this data we have the theta and range of psi covered by
*     each observation. We can derive a crossing time as 
*        Crossing time =  (source psi - start of scan psi)
*                               / (scan psi rate)
*     We can use this time to calculate a more accurate solar longitude
*     at time of crossing as
*        Solar longitude = (SOP start solar longitude) +
*                          (Crossing time ) * (the solar longitude rate)
*     And we can calculate the source ecliptic longitude at the crossing
*     time.
*
*     -  In what follows the subsections of a SOP, denoted by different
*     observation numbers are called observations. The name scan is
*     reserved for the subsection of an observation which is to be
*     extracted to cover part of the required region around the source
*     position.
