      SUBROUTINE FIND29( POUTDE, MENU, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FIND29

*  Purpose:
*     The subroutine creates the output files which can be read by the
*     Boresight Survey Data Extraction Program, EXCRDD. This subroutine
*     creates a sorted list of scans for each plate record and calls the
*     subroutine FIND23 to actually output the required HDS file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FIND29( POUTDE, MENU, STATUS )

*  Description:
*  
*     The subroutine creates the output files which can be read by the
*     Boresight Survey Data Extraction Program, EXCRDD.This subroutine
*     creates a sorted list of scans for each plate record and calls the
*     subroutine FIND23 to actually output the required HDS file.
*
*     -  Each plate record is used to generate a separate output file.
*     Although it is possible that a single plate number may have
*     several plate records (see below).
*
*     -  All the scans which need to be extracted from this plate
*     are identified using the cross linkages between the plate record,
*     and source common and scan common.
*
*     -  Each scan identified is added to a linked list, which is sorted
*     by their start UCTS time. This corresponds to the order of the
*     data on the IRAS Survey plate. The first scan in this list is
*     identified by a pointer in the plate record, the pointer being
*     the position of the first scan in scan common. From the first
*     scan onward each identified scan in scan common contains a
*     pointer to the next one in the time order, again the pointer is
*     the position of this following scan in scan common.
*     
*     -  The finish time of each scan in the linked list is compared
*     with the start time of the next in the time order. If these times
*     are found to overlap the scan overlap flag is set.
*
*     -  An HDS file for each plate is created using FIND23
*
*  Arguments:
*     POUTDE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter OUTDESCFILE for output file to contain description
*        of plate files created and tapes required for them
*     MENU   = CHARACTER * ( 1 ) (Given and Returned)
*        Choice from FINDCRDD main menu
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*
*  Algorithm:
*
*     For each plate record
*
*     -  For  each source in the plate common record.
*
*        If the source is required
*        
*        -  For each scan in the source common record.
*
*           If the scan is required
*
*           - Enter the scan into its correct position in the chain of
*           pointers which form a list of scans ordered by their start
*           UTCS time. This involves:-
*           
*              If the scan is the first scan identified for this source
*              put its scan common position identifier into the plate
*              record's first scan position variable.
*
*              If the scan not the first scan required for this plate
*              follow the chain of pointers, starting at that in the
*              plate record, and followed by the sequence pointed to
*              in the scan next position pointers. Examine the start
*              UTCS of each scan and compare with that of the scan to be
*              entered until the correct position is found. Break the
*              chain at this point and relink to include scan to be
*              entered in the pointer sequence.
*
*     -  When all the scans for this plate have been entered go through
*     the sorted list of scans and determine if the start time of the
*     next scan is before the end UTCS time of this scan. If so mark
*     the first scan as being overlapped.
*
*     -  Call FIND23 to write plate record output HDS file
*
*     -  A file 'FINDCRDD_PLATES_REQ' is created containing a list of
*     the plates for which HDS files have been created including the
*     number of scans per source, and the tape id from which data should
*     be extracted.
