  The Fortran notation is declared in the PROGRAMCODE DTD which this
  INCLUDEs at the end.

<!--============================== Architectures ==============================

  Declare the PROGRAMCODE DTD to be an architecture.

  This doesn't have a huge impact, but as well as being The Right HyTime
  Thing To Do, it allows us to impose the PROGRAMCODE structure even
  on (admittedly rare) files which do whizzy things in their internal
  DTD subset.

<!--============================== Maps ==============================

  Set up maps, to make typing prologues easier.

  Collect a suitable set of starttag and cdata entities.

  First, arrange that ^*+ and ^*- begin and end the prologue, and that
  ^* is IGNOREd while within the prologue.

  Now some tricksier stuff for documenting routine parameters.
  Structure is

     <!ELEMENT parameter - O (name, type, description)>

  Within PARAMETER element, have `=' be a shortref for TYPE (don't
  have it within NAME, since that element is also used within the
  ROUTINENAME element) and discard &#RS;* as usual.  Within TYPE, have
  both `:' and &#RE be shortrefs for DESCRIPTION.  Within the
  DESCRIPTION, merely discard &#RS;*

  This means that

    <parameter given>
      <name>Blah
      <type>float
      <description>This is a variable

  is contractable to

    <parameter given>
      Blah = float
      This is a variable

  Note that it is not a shortcut to have `textmap' enabled
  within element <name>, because within the <name> enclosed by
  <parameter> we need `=' to be a shortref for partype.ref (which maps
  to <type>).  We can't reasonably have `=' included in `textmap', as
  this would cause chaos whenever anyone used an `=' sign in normal
  text (which someone _will_ do).  If we could have different maps for
  `name inside parameter' and `name everywhere else', there would be
  no problem; but we can't, so there.  Because it is enabled within
  <parameter>, `parametermap' is inherited by <name> elements within that.
