  DTD for program source code structure.

  This DTD was not designed to be used on its own, but instead
  included at the end of a language-specific DTD, which defines a
  notation, and sets up shortref maps to make inputting the source
  file easier - for example, the Fortran DTD makes `^*+' a shortref
  for the CODEPROLOGUE start tag, and ignores `^*' within the
  CODEPROLOGUE.  However, since it _is_ intended to be used as an
  architecture, it _could_ be used on its own, if you have an
  application which can benefit from that.  I would recommend not
  doing that, however, until there's a clear benefit: the present
  practice of making different `editions' of this for different
  languages forces me to think a little about the different languages'
  requirements, and which features might need to be restricted or expanded.

  Additions to the list of supported languages requires at least
  modifying the %notationlist entity, and adding appropriate notation
  definitions.

  Invoke with something like:

    <!entity % DTD.Version "DTD Starlink Fortrancode 0.5">
    <!entity % language.attr	-- language name --
	 "language notation (FORTRAN77) #fixed FORTRAN77">
    <!entity % generalcode.dtd
	public "-//Starlink//DTD Program Source Code 0.5//EN">
    %generalcode.dtd;

  The definition of the %language.attr entity is required.
  The %direction.attr entity may also be predefined, and if the DTD
  which calls this one wishes to do other architectural remapping
  (only the DSSSL one does at present), then it can define further
  attributes as noted below.

     Note that the DSSSL notation declaration mentioned in the above

     Note also that I've changed the name of the Fortran notation to
     Fortran77, to support a future distinction of this from Fortran 90.

<!--========== Tables ==========-->
<!-- Use the OASIS Exchange Table Model subset of the CALS table model.
     See http://www.oasis-open.org/html/a503.htm for discussion, and
     http://www.oasis-open.org/html/publtext.htm for public texts.

     The Exchange Table Model can be customised.  Adjust the table entry
     model, and remove the %titles entity

     Also rename the table element to `tabular'.  This fits in well with
     the LaTeX model folk will be familiar with, and allows us to
     separate the floating plus captioning plus id stuff from the
     lining-it-up-in-columns of tabular layouts.

     This Programcode DTD uses the same TABULAR element as the General
     DTD, but does not use the TABLE element.
