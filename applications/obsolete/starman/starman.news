                                                  Expires: 95.**.**

 Starman has extensive general purpose programs for image display and 
 image handling, and for handling tabular data.

 Its main aim is stellar photometry, and is especially suited for stars
 in crowded fields. 

 A Unix version of the Starman photometry package has now been released,
 with a number of upgrades.

 It has some advantages over packages such as DAOPHOT, DoPHOT, and 
 SAOIMAGE.

 To start it, type "starman". A hypertext help is available with
 "starmanhyperhelp", an ordinary help with "starmanhelp". A demo can
 be seen with "starmandemo".
