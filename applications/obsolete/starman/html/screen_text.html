 This gives help on various aspects of screen display
<p>

<strong>   Image Display </strong><p>


 Images can be displayed on any X windows display.
<p>

 The display must have an 8-bit display (i.e. 256
 colours available at any one time). It may not work on mono or 24-bit
 displays.
<p>

 Also any device, including hardcopy, can be used to output a greyscale plot
 of an image by using the image graphical output in the INSPECT option in
 the INTERACT program. 
<p>

<strong>   Use of Pointer and Buttons </strong><p>


 To mark a position, one puts the pointer on the desired position, and marks
 that point by pressing one of the buttons on the mouse. Each button will
 often have a different effect, and one should look at the `help' for the
 program to see what the buttons actually do in any particular case.
 Usually, the right-hand button denotes 'exit' from the particular function
 being performed.  Starman can work with either two or three buttons
 available for use on the mouse. If only two buttons can be used, then the
 action of the third button is simulated by pressing the two buttons
 together, with the middle one being pressed shortly before the left-hand
 one. In this case also use of the middle button by itself has to followed
 by a half-second pause.
<p>
 
 (To see how to set up for the actual number, look at the 'help' for
 `Numbutt' in the desired program.)
<p>

<strong>   Look-Up Table </strong><p>


 Starman can only be used to display images on devices that have 8-bit
 colour displays. This nominally gives the use of 256 different colours.
<p>

 Starman allocates the first two colours to black and white, the next
 eight to the 
<p>

 `red:green:blue:cyan:magenta:yellow:coral:palegreen'

 colours of PGPLOT. The next five are then various shades of grey from
 black to white for the `panel' and other uses.
<p>

 Images are then displayed using the next 150 colours. The default
 when you run any of these programs is these colours are black to
 white, going through shades of grey. An image is displayed by taking
 the pixel values, translating them into numbers between 1 and 150,
 and loading them in the display device. The display device then has
 has a colour for corresponding to each of the numbers between 1 and
 150. These colours are linear combinations of (red, green and blue).
 Thus white is (1.0,1.0,1.0), black is (0.0,0.0,0.0), blue is
 (0.0,0.0,1.0), and so on.
<p>
 
 (When an image is displayed, the default is displayed so that high pixel
 values are given low look-up table (LUT) values, and thus come out as
 blacked than low pixel values. Thus images are generally shown as
 `negatives'.) 
<p>

 When the LUT is altered, it is the colours that correspond to those 150
 numbers that are changed, not the numbers themselves. Thus if a pixel value
 has been loaded into the display as (say) 15, it will first of all be a
 dark grey (colour - 0.1,0.1,0.1). If the LUT is changed, the colour could
 now be anything (say pink - 0.7,0.5,0.5). 
<p>
 
 However, with X window devices, some or all of the 256 possible colours may
 have already been allocated by another program, and thus be inaccessible to
 the Starman program. In this case, the Starman program first of tries to
 use only 75 LUT colours, and then only 50 LUT colours. If these are
 available, it uses those, and has to make a coarser binning of the display.
 If there are less than 50 colours available, then the program will use those
 `default' colours available to all programs on the device. They may well be
 very few of these, and thus the display may be very simplistic.
<p>
 
<strong>   Graphical User Interface </strong><p>


 Starman has two modes whereby when inside some its programs, one can get
 away from the old-fashioned interaction of typing in lines of commands.
<p>

   Macintosh-like_Interaction
<p>

 For a number of programs, to do with image and graph display the `OPTION'
 parameters, where the program is repeatedly asking for different options,
 one can set up a `panel' of `push-buttons' which you click on with the
 cursor to choose the desired option. This is much like the way you use
 a Macintosh.
<p>
 
 To do this you need to be at a workstation. The programs where this is
 possible and the parameters where it can be done are:- 
<p>

<pre> 
  Program    Option Parameter 
  -------    ----------------
  Diagram    `Option' 
  Dustring   `Option' 
  Interact   `Option' `Aloption' `Aoption' `Coption' `Goption' 
             `Ioption' `Soption'
  Profile    `Option' `Doption', `Moption', `Roption' `Woption' 
  Tbchart    `Option' 
  Tbplot     `Option' 
</pre><p>

 If, in response to a request for these parameters, one inputs `panel', then
 a panel of the various options is put up on the workstation screen, and one
 can choose the options by clicking on the `buttons' in the `panel'.
<p>

<strong>   Graph Display </strong><p>


 Starman uses the PGPLOT/GKS packages to output graphs. This means that
 nearly all graphical output devices, including hardcopy, on Starlink can be
 used. When a graph is to be plotted, you are asked for the value of the
 `GTYPE' parameter. You then input the GNS name of the device you want. If
 you choose the default `ask', you then get another question and you can
 then type `?'. This will give you the list of the names of the available
 devices. You will have to consult your system manager to see which physical
 device is attached to which name. 
<p>
 
 The usual names re `xwindows' and `ps', for X window devices and
 Postcript printers.
<p>

<strong>   Use of Pointer and Buttons </strong><p>

 With PGPLOT, one puts the pointer on the desired position, and marks that
 point by pressing any key on the {\em keyboard}.
<p>
 
<strong>   Tables Spread-Sheet </strong><p>


 There is a spread-sheet for interacting with tables, which works,
 to a limited extent, like the spread-sheet programs on your PC.
 This is the TBSHEET program. If you have a terminal that supports
 graphics, however simply, then you can use this to inspect and
 change the values in the table. Also simple applications like
 SORTing and WEEDing may be done.
<p>

 The table is put up on the screen in a grid, and all the options
 to inspect and/or change the table are put up as boxes. One uses
 the cursor to click on values to change them, or on options to
 undertake those options.
