<h1> TBCHART - <br>
 Plot out a realistic star map
</h1>
<hr>
 
 
<p>
 
 This plots out a realistic looking star map, with filled circles,
 bigger for brighter stars, at the positions of an input list of
 star positions and magnitudes. The star identifications may be put
 by the stars. Overlapping stars may be distinguished by having
 circles round all stars. If used, these circles may be removed
 (overwritten).
<p>

 The input file is a table with columns with headers showing the
 'X','Y' positions and 'MAGNITUDES' or 'HEIGHTS'. If these headers
 are absent, it is assumed that columns 1,2,3 have X,Y,MAG.
<p>
 
 The program is worked using a menu-driven approach. You choose
 various options from the menu. This menu can be driven through a
 'panel-button' type of display.
<p>
 
 With an interactive device, a cursor can be used to read out the
 cursor position and the details of the nearest star read out.
<p>
 
 The user has control of the ranges of star positions and magnitudes
 that are plotted out and the size of the area plotted. More than
 one input list may be plotted.
<p>
 
 In a star identifier, a '#' as the 1st charcater is ignored, and a star
 identifier consisting solely of '#' is not put out.

 <h2> 3 <a name="panel_choice"> Panel choice </h2> </a> <p>
 
  In the menu-driven mode of this program, there is the capability
 to interact with this menu in a `windows' type mode. If you choose
 the `Panel' option in the `Option' choice, then if you have an
 X-window device a small panel appears on the screen. This has what look
 like buttons with all the available options. You select these by
 putting a cursor on the `button' and then pressing a mouse button.
<p>
 
 The panel has a `help' button which lists out one line
 descriptions of all the options. This button also tells you what
 the program is doing:- 'working', 'waiting', etc.

 <h2> 4.1 <a name="devlimx"> Devlimx </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - Min,max in table      <br> Range - -1.0e10 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
  The X start and end of the area to be plotted.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.2 <a name="devlimy"> Devlimy </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - Min,max in table      <br> Range - -1.0e10 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
  The Y start and end of the area to be plotted.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.3 <a name="gtype"> Gtype </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'xwindows'            <br> Choice - any)
<p>
 
  A character string giving the local name for the graphics
  display type.
<p>
 
  'xwindows' will put it out on the screen of your X-window,
  if you are using one.
<p>
 
  If 'ask' is input, then the program asks a very similar question,
  in a different way. A response here of '?' will bring up a listing
  of all the possible names of graphics devices which are supported
  on your machine, and you then input the appropriate name.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.4 <a name="hmin"> Hmin </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - Minimum in table       <br> Range - 1.0e-10 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
  The zero point in the scale for plotting the radii of the
  circles to represent a star. These circles have radii
  of:- (MMIN-mag)*MSCALE in terms of the plotted scale.
<p>
 
 MMIN is converted from 'Hmin' by (30.0-2.5*alog10(hmin))
<p>

 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.5 <a name="hrange"> Hrange </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - Min,max in table      <br> Range - 1.0e-10 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
  The start and end of the range of heights in the table
  that a star can have to be plotted.
<p>

  The heights are converted to magnitudes by the equation
<p>

  Mag = 30.0 - 2.5*alog10(ht).
<p> 


<hr>
 <h2> 4.6 <a name="in"> In </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (default - null)
<p>
 
  The name of the file containing the input (position, magnitude)
  table. It must have at least three columns.
<p>

  The program looks for columns with headers 'X', 'Y', and 'MAGNITUDE'.
  If it cant find 'MAGNITUDE', it will look for 'HEIGHT'. If it cant
  find these, it will assume that Column 1 has 'X', Column 2 has 'Y'
  and Column 3 has 'MAGNITUDE'. If 'HEIGHT' is used, these are
  transformed into magnitudes by the equation:-<p>
  
  Mag = 30.0 - 2.5*alog10(ht)
<p>

  Abbreviations and lower case headers are accepted. 
<p>

  The table must be a standard Starman table format file. It
  is a Starman ADAM .SDF image, with `real' 32-bit real values,
  with each column having a header of up to 20 characters, and
  each row having a name of up to 20 characters.
<p>

<hr>
 <h2> 4.7 <a name="linecol"> Linecol </h2> </a> <p>
 
   (Default - 'black'            <br> Choice - `black:white')
<p>
 
    Colour of plot lines. This is determined by whether you have a
    black or white background to your plots.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.8 <a name="lsize"> Lsize </h2> </a> <p>

 (Default - 1.0               <br> Range - 0.0 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
  The size of the text to be used when plotting the stars
  identifiers. A size of 1.0 gives letters with heights of about
  1/100th of the plotted Y range.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.9 <a name="mmin"> Mmin </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - Maximum in table       <br> Range - -1.0e10 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
  The zero point in the scale for plotting the radii of the
  circles to represent a star. These circles have radii
  of:- (MMIN-mag)*MSCALE in terms of the plotted scale.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.10 <a name="mrange"> Mrange </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - Min,max in table      <br> Range - -1.0e10 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
  The start and end of the range of magnitudes in the table
  that a star can have to be plotted.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.11 <a name="mscale"> Mscale </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 1.0        <br> Range - -1.0e10 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
  The 'SCALE' in the scale for plotting the radii of the
  circles to represent a star. These circles have radii
  of:- (MMIN-mag)*MSCALE in terms of the plotted scale.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.12 <a name="numbutt"> Numbutt </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - see below          <br> Range - 2 to 3)
<p>
 
  Number of `X-Window' buttons available on the mouse.
<p>
 
  Some devices have two and some have three buttons available. This
  can depend both on their actual presence, and also on the X Windows
  software that is being run.
<p>
 
  With three buttons, then the Starman programs use all three, with
  the right-hand button being used mainly as the 'exit' button.
<p>
 
  With two buttons, then the third button is simulated by pressing
  both of the buttons down, with the middle one being pressed slightly
  BEFORE the left-hand one. Use of the middle button in its normal
  way has to be modified, in that one has to pause for half a second
  after using it.
<p>
 
  [This parameter is usally 'hidden', with the machine manager setting
   it to the appropriate value for the local set-up. Sometimes it will
   be left to the user to set, depending on his software configuartion.]

  that a star can have to be plotted.
