<h1> SPRINKLE - <br>  Make a table of field/cluster stars
</h1>
<hr>
 
 
<p>
 
  Makes a table of stars with random positions, magnitudes, colours and
  heights. This table represents the stars in a star field. It can be
  used with the `addstars' program to make an image of a `random' star
  field, either as a uniform distribution, or as a cluster. The colours
  and magnitudes can be set in a number of diverse ways.
<p>
 
  It thus outputs two types of stars, cluster stars and field stars.
<p>
 
  The cluster stars are distributed in position to mimic a cluster with
  a King profile and in magnitude and colour to follow either an
  input colour-magnitude diagram (specified by an input file designed to
  model a cluster CMD) or one of randomly scattered magnitudes.
<p>
 
  The field stars have a random x,y distribution and a cmd of again
  either an input CMD (designed in a different way to model a field
  star distribution) or a random scatter in colour and magnitude.
<p>
 
  The range in position, colour and magnitude allowed can be specified.

 <h2> 1 <a name="use"> Use </h2> </a> <p>
 
<ol>
<li> Make a table of the cluster CMD and field star CMD. (See the help
    on 'Cluster' and 'Field' on how to do this.) Or you can (for
    either) decide to have a CMD with random magnitudes and colours
    evenly scattered over a chosen mag and colour range.
<p>
 
<li> Decide :-
<p>
<ul>
<li>    - What reddening and distance modulus you want them both to have.
<li>     - Where in the field you want the cluster centre to be.
<li>     - How large the field is (for both field and cluster stars).
<li>     - What region of the CMD you want filled (for field/cluster stars).
<li>     - On the cluster King core and tidal radii.
<li>     - On the number of cluster and field stars to make.
<li>     - On the random seed numbers.
</ul><p>
 
<li> Run the program.
<p>
 
<li> The output is a table of star positions, heights, magnitudes,
    and colours.

  The selection of a random magnitude and colour
  ----------------------------------------------
<p>
 
  The colour-magnitude diagram is input as lines in the CMD. Each line
  is specified by [a start mag,col; an end mag,col; the number of stars
  in that line]. The program then sums the total number of stars in all
  the lines. To choose a random (mag,col), it selects a random number in
  the range 0.0 to 1.0, and finds in which line segment the ratio of
  (sum of stars in lines so far)/(total no of stars) is first greater
  than the number chosen. Thus the lines are selected in proportion to
  the number of stars in them. Then a (mag,col) is chosen from a uniform
  random distribution along the chosen line.
<p>
 
  Thus the line segments do not have to be contiguous in the CMD, but
  no smoothing in the number distribution from one line to the next is
  made (which if they are not touching would be incorrect). Thus to
  insure no falsely rapid changes in the number distribution are made,
  the line segments must be short enough that in each one, a uniform
  number distribution is suitable.
<p>
 
  After this the input distance modulus and reddening are applied (after
  the table (m-M) and Eb-v (say) have been removed).
<p>
 
  Then the input limits on magnitude and colour are checked. If the
  chosen mag,col lies within the limits, they are accepted; if not,
  then the process is repeated.
<p>
 
<strong> Alternative </strong>
<p>
 
  No table is input, and the mag,cols are uniformly distributed within
  the mag,col limits.
<p>
 
 
<strong>   The selection of a random X,Y Position </strong>
<p>
 
  The King core and tidal radii are used to make a random selection
  of distance from the cluster centre, which results in the King
  radial distribution. These are then uniformily distributed in
  position angle around the cluster. They are accepted if they fall
  within the input position limits.
<p>
 
  The core and tidal radii have thus to be input as 'pixel' values.
<p>
 
  The King distribution is that defined by Ivan King in:- AJ 67,471;
  AJ 70,376; AJ 71,64
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.2 <a name="field_stars"> Field stars </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
<strong> The selection of a random magnitude and colour </strong>
<p>
 
  The colour-magnitude diagram is input as numbers of stars in uniform
  areas in a grid in the CMD.
<p>
 
  The table specifying the CMD gives the location of the top left hand
  area and the area size. The table then contains the number of stars
  in each area. The program then sums the total number of stars in all
  the areas. To choose a random (mag,col), it selects a random number in
  the range 0.0 to 1.0, and finds in which area the ratio of
  (sum of stars in areas so far)/(total no of stars) is first greater
  than the number chosen. Thus the areas are selected in proportion to
  the number of stars in them. Then a (mag,col) is chosen from a uniform
  random distribution within the chosen area.
<p>
 
  Thus no smoothing in the number distribution from one area to the
  next is made. So to insure no falsely rapid changes in the number
  distribution are made, the areas must be small enough that in each
  one, a uniform number distribution is suitable.
<p>
 
  After this the input distance modulus and reddening are applied (after
  the table (m-M) and Eb-v (say) have been removed).
<p>
 
  Then the input limits on magnitude and colour are checked. If the
  chosen mag,col lies within the limits, they are accepted; if not,
  then the process is repeated.
<p>
 
<strong>   Alternative </strong>
<p>
 
  No table is input, and the mag,cols are uniformly distributed within
  the mag,col limits.
<p>
 
 
<strong>   The selection of a random X,Y Position </strong>
<p>
 
  A uniform random distribution within the input limits is made.

 The star positions are selected from random field or cluster
 positions. The magnitudes and colours of the stars can be
 selected from a uniform distribution, or from a `CMD'.

  Input table giving a cluster CMD. It contains rows describing line
  segements of the cluster.
<p>
 
<dl>
<dt>  (A)
<dd>Each row of the table contains a description of a line segment of
      the cluster CMD. It has, in order,:-
<p>

<dd>  See the help on 'Method' as to how this is used.
<p>
 
 
<dt>  (C)
<dd> The table also has, as descriptors, the reddening and distance
      modulus of the CMD. Thus when the user inputs the desired
      reddening and distance modulus, the table descriptor values are
      first subtracted.
<p>
 
      Thus, for example, if the user puts in the same reddening and
      distance modulus as the value in the cluster file, the values in
      the cluster table for the stars are used unaltered.
<p>
 
      The table descriptors are:-

    in the areas in one horizontal row of the grid, and the rows in toto
    make up the whole CMD. The number of columns in a row gives the
    horizontal number of areas in the grid and the number of rows gives
    the vertical number. The size of each area is described in the table
    descriptors, and the location of the grid in the CMD is also
    described there.
<p>

<dd> See the help on 'Method' for further description.
<p>
 
<dt> (C)
<dd> The table also has, as descriptors, the reddening and distance

    and distance modulus, the table ones are first subtracted.
<p>
 
    Thus, for example, if the user puts in the same reddening and
    distance modulus as the value in the field file, the values in the

    The table has descriptors:-

    MSTEP and CSTEP must be positive.
<p>
 
<dt> (D)
<dd> The table can be made at the keyboard by the program TBKEY, and the

<hr>
 <h2> 4 <a name="random_seeds"> Random seeds </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The choosing of the random values is done with the a simple
  algorithm, which starts from an input seed and creates a pseudo-random
  number form 0 to 1 from that and updates the seed.
<p>
 
  This seed number is fed in by the user.
<p>
 
  So if you feed in the same seed, you will get the same distribution
  of star mag,col and positions. A different seed will give a different
  pattern. These seeds have to be large (over a billion) to ensure
  good randomising. There are separate seeds for the cluster and field
  stars, so one pattern can be repeated, whilst holding the other
  constant.
<p>
 
 
<hr>
 <h2> 5 <a name="output"> Output </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
   The table contains seven columns. For each star, the entry is:-
<p>
<pre>
    column  header    content
    ------  ------    -------
     1      X         x posn
     2      Y         y posn
     3      HEIGHT1   height of star in the 1st colour
                       band (e.g. 'V')
     4      HEIGHT2   height of star in the 2nd colour
                       band (e.g. 'B')
     5      MAG1      1st colour band magnitude (e.g. 'V')
     6      COL       colour (e.g. 'B-V')
     7      MAG2      2nd colour band magnitude (e.g. 'B')
 
</pre><p>
 
     Thus from the input table(s) of (say) 'V' and 'B-V', an output
     table of X, Y, V height, B height, V, B-V, and B is made.
<p>
 
     The stars are named as #1, #2, #3, etc.

 It is also possible, through the LOG parameter, to get a typing out as
 the program goes.

 <h2> 7.25 <a name="m1fact"> M1fact </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 1000.0       <br> Range - 1.0e-8 to 1.0e8)
<p>
 
  This is the scale conversion from magnitude to height for the first
  colour band. You input the height  (linear flux equivalent) a star
  of magnitude 20.0 in the input magnitude (e.g. 'V') should have.
<p>
 
  This is used in the conversion in the output table between the
  magnitudes in column 5 (MAG1) and the heights of column 3 (HEIGHT1).

 <h2> 7.26 <a name="m2fact"> M2fact </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - M1fact     <br> Range - 1.0e-8 to 1.0e8)
<p>
 
  This is the scale conversion from magnitude to height for the second
  colour band. You input the height  (linear flux equivalent) a star
  of magnitude 20.0 in 'Mag' + 'Col' = 2nd magnitude band
  (e.g. 'V' + 'B-V' = 'B') should have.
<p>
 
  This is used in the conversion in the output table between the
  magnitudes in column 7 (MAG2) and the heights of column 4 (HEIGHT2).
