<hr><h2> <a name="pr_help"> STARMANHELP - Help system for Starman </a> </h2> 
 
This program gives help on the <i>Starman</i> package. It works on line
display equipment, so it does not need the  X-display system that this
is being read on.<p>

As you are reading this in <i>Starmanhyperhelp</i>, <i>Starmanhelp</i>
will not be of great interest to you.<p>

<i>Starmanhelp</i> is used inside the other programs. When asked for
a parameter, if you type '?', then the <i>Starmanhelp</i> system is
entered, and help on that parameter is given. If you type '??', as
well as the help itself, you find you have entered <i>Starmanhelp</i>
itself and can browse round inside that, before exiting back into
the program you were running.<p>

<i>Starmanhelp</i> is based on a heirarchy of text, with progress
up and down trees. The top-level access is:-<p>
