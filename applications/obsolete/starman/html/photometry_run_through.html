 The first goal of Starman is to provide tools for performing stellar 
 photometry on images. To give an introduction on how to use these tools,
 a list is given below of a basic run through of how to get from the
 data on tape to the output astronomy.
<p>

<dl>

<dt> <strong>      1) IMFITS_DR </strong><dd>
  
       Read the data from a FITS disk file into \starman format files.

<p><dt> <strong>      2) UNCCD</strong><dd>
  
       Process your raw image into one without CCD effects.

<p><dt> <strong>      3) INTERACT    </strong><dd>
  
       Make a table of the (X,Y) positions of about six bright
       isolated stars.

<p><dt> <strong>        4) PROFILE    </strong><dd>

       Use those stars to define the mean star profile.

<p><dt> <strong>        5) STARFIND (+INTERACT) or just INTERACT</strong><dd>

       Make a table of the (X,Y) positions of all the stars in the image
       you want to measure, and also all the stars that
       affect them. If you are measuring stars on a series
       of exposures to the same field, you should first make a
       'deep' exposure by adding all the exposures together
       with IMJOIN, and then marking the positions on that.
       This will enable you to mark the very faintest stars.
       Wether it is worth the effort if you have to align the
       images first is another matter.
 
<p><dt> <strong>        6) MEASURE   </strong><dd>

       Do the fitting, using the profile and star position
       list already made.
 
<p><dt> <strong>        7) INTERACT    </strong><dd>

       Have a look at the cleaned image and/or the places
       stars fitted etc, to do a quality control check
       You may at this stage wish to go back a number of steps.
 
<p><dt> <strong>        8) CHI </strong><dd>

       Take the magnitude list output of MEASURE and define
       the Chi-squared values for an acceptable fit.
 
<p><dt> <strong>        9) AVERAGE     </strong><dd>

       Average all acceptable fits from several different
       exposures measured using the same star list.
 
<p><dt> <strong>       10) DIAGRAM    </strong><dd>

       Combine the magnitudes to make a colour-magnitude
       or colour-colour diagram.

<p><dt> <strong>       11) AUTOMAG </strong><dd>

       Perform automatic aperture photometry on the images
       with the standard stars, and correct for atmospheric 
       extinction.
