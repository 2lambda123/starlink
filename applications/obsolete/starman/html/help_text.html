Go to <a href="main.html"> Starman Help Main. </a>
<hr>


  Here there is on-line help on the :-  
<p>

<ul>
<li> Starman in general under `Starman'. 
<li> Starman suite in 'guide'
<li> Individual programs under their names
<li> Image system under 'images'. 
<li> Table system under 'tables'. 
<li> A list of programs is in 'menu'. 
</ul><p>

  If lost, read the Starman manual SUN141 and other Starlink manuals.
<p>
  Outside a program, type 'starmanhelp' to access the help system, and
  'starmanbrowse' to access the hypertext help system.
<p>

  Inside a program you can access the help when asked for a  parameter 
  - replying with a '?' will get you help on that parameter, and replying 
  with a '??' will get you into the general help system, at the point of 
  that parameter, from where you can go back up the  help system and down 
  to any desired point.
<p>
    
When you put the cursor over a push-button when using a <a href="#panel">
panel</a> , then help for that button is automatically displayed in a
separate 'help' window. An example of this is the
<a href="interact_help.gif"> help window </a> when starting aperture
photometry in the <a href="interact.html"> interact </a> program.<p>
