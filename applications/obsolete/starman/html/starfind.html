<h1> STARFIND - Find stars
</h1>
<hr>
 
 
<p>
 
  This program finds stars in an image.
<p>
 
  It works by looking for boxes of roughly the seeing size which
  are above (in a significant way) their surroundings. It is a good
  searcher, but slow, although it can be sped up by setting the
  search limits so it does not look for very improbable stars.
<p>
 
  It can deal with variations in the background level, but gets
  thrown by very large galaxies. If it encounters small galaxies, it
  gives them the benefit of the doubt and marks up a double star.
<p>
 
  It is not perfect, and the eye can do better in some cases. It is
  very good on very faint isolated stars, finding (real) things you
  wouldnt believe, but in very crowded fields or very overlapping
  stars, it is good to run STARFIND and then delete and add the few
  corrections to the star list produced. This can be done by INTERACT.
<p>
 
  The output file is not asked for until the very end of the program,
  after it has found the stars. If you want to input the file name at
  the beginning of the program, do so in the command line when running
  the program, with OUT='name of file' and TITLE='title to add to file'.
  This will then permit the program to access these when it needs them
<p>
 
  The program will not work on images smaller than 10x10.

 <h2> 1 <a name="use"> Use </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  First you must know very roughly the radius of the star images.
<p>
 <ol>
<li> Start the program.
<p><li> Input the control parameters
<p><li> A list of star positions comes out.
<p><li> Er - that's it.
</ol><p>
 
  There are two options to omit two parts of the searching to speed
  things up. Use of these options will result in not finding a few of
  the tricky stars.
<p>
 
  There are also two input paramaters to select the range of stars
  found to differing probability limits.
<p>
 
  There is also a not very critical parameter, the size of the large
  sky box the program uses. I suggest you adopt the computer suggested
  size.
<p>
 
  If you are interested in the progress of the program you can set
  the parameter INFORM to different levels to get different levels of
  output on the terminal as you go along.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2 <a name="method"> Method </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 
 The finding is done by:-
<p>
 
<dl>
<dt> <strong> (A) </strong>
<p><dd> Making a 'U-map' image of the input image. This is a map of the
     probability that a pixel is significantly higher than its
     surroundings, and so is likely to be near the peak of a star.
     Thus a 'sharpened' image is made of star-sized objects above the
     local levels.
<p>
 
<dt> <strong> (B) </strong>
<p><dd> Looking in the U-map image for:-
<p>
<ol>
<li> Star peaks and plateaus
<p><li> Elliptical stars, and saying that is actually two stars
<p><li> Shoulders running off from stars, and saying they are actually
        stars
</ol><p>
 
<dt> <strong> (C) </strong>
<p><dd> Weeding the stars found for spurious ones
<p>
 
 This process has been deliberately tuned to be reasonably generous
 in finding stars, so it should find more than there are. The output
 of this should be put into a proper star measuring program to
 sort out the (small number of) false alarms.
<p>
 
 There is a limit on the number of stars that can be found.
<p>
 
 These matters are described more fully in the sub-headings below.
<p>
</dl>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.1 <a name="u-map"> U-map </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The U-map is made by:-
<p>
 
 Running a non-parametric test (one tailed mann-whitney U test)
 over every point in the image. At each point it takes a box
 (roughly a seeing size) round that point and compares it with
 an equal area around that box. It looks at the ranks of points
 when all put together, and assigns a probability
 (0-1 1=certain) to the chance that the ranks are NOT scattered
 at random, and thus that the data in the box is different
 AND higher from that in the annulus round it. This is then
 repeated with the comparision area separated by 1 pixel from
 the central box, and then with slices on each side,and then
 with slice on top and bottom. The comparision which indicates
 the most difference is taken.
<p>
 
 The U-map image of probabilities is a sharpened (on the scale
 of the box used) copy of the input. Thus the background (sky,
 large-scale effects such as galaxies, fringes, etc) is
 automatically allowed for. The box size is 3x3 for radius less
 than 1.75, 5x5 for radius less than 2.5 and then 7x7 up to 5.5,
 and therafter  ( nbox = 1 + 2*int(1.0+(radius-1.5)/2.0) )
<p>
 
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.2 <a name="peaks"> Peaks </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The peaks are found by searching the U-map for isolated images.
<p>
 
    This is done by lowering a threshold and looking for isolated
    patches above those thresholds. The mean position of the largest
    size patch before it merges in the lowering with another is taken
    as the star position. The lowering continues until the U-map
    probability level of 'x' is reached (i.e. their is a 'x' chance
    that the values are not different from the surrounds). 'x' is
    is a user input number. An 'x' value of 0.001 will result in
    about 100 false detections in a 320 by 512 image. Thus
    normally, a value of 0.01 is used.
<p>
 
    The lowering then continues down to the 'y' probablity level,
    but only those patches which have values in the corresponding
    real image significantly (2.25 std devs) above the local sky
    level are found. This finds faint stars on the wings of bright
    ones. 'y' is normally 0.05, but to speed the process up, can
    be set to the 'x' level of step 3).
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.2.1 <a name="sky"> Sky </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The local sky level referred to above has previously been
 determined by the program.
<p>
 
 This is done by making a 'sky map', that is a temporary image the
 same size as the input image, with its pixel values set to what the
 program thinks is the value of the background sky at that pixel.
<p>
 
 It also determines another sky map, which have the local values of
 (sky+scatter), where 'scatter' is the largest reasonable value the
 sky noise could add to the sky level in a pixel.
<p>
 
 These are determined in one of three ways:-
<p>
 
<ol>
<li> Subdividing the image into largeish (set by you, but suggested
     at 64x64) boxes, finding local modes and scatters, and then
     interpolating between these local modes by linear interpolation
     between the box centres. The scatter about the mode of the lowest
     mode is taken as the sky scatter.
<p>
 
<li> Taking the input image as having a uniform background. The mode of
     the image is found, and the std dev about this mode found.
<p>
 
     This is the default way.
<p>
 
<li> Looking for the minimum pixel value and taking that as the sky
     level. The noise is taken as the std dev about the mode level of
     the whole image.
<p>
</ol>
 
 The default should be chosen unless there is smooth and
 significant change in the sky background (say from an elliptical
 galaxy which covers most of the image). If the change in the sky
 background is sharp, say from a globular cluster manifesting itself
 over 50 pixels, choose the default anyway.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.3 <a name="ellipticity"> Ellipticity </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The found images are searched for ellipticity, an indication of 2
 stars close together, merging to make one.
<p>
 
 The program looks at stars and sees if the U-test image shape of the
 star is elliptical. For a star to qualify as elliptical, the
 group of flagged pixels that make up the star (that is the number
 of contiguous pixels flagged as being below the present
 significance level) have to satisfy certain criteria:-
<p>
 
<ul>
<li>    - the ellipticity has to be greater than a given limit, 0.35
<li>     - the semi-major axis has to be larger than a given limit
        (0.67 times the star image profile radius)
<li>     - the area of the star has to be more than seven pixels
<li>     - the area of the star must not touch the image edge
<li>     - the area of the star does not contain other stars
</ol><p>
 
 This searching is only done when new stars are found in the main
 program. On these occasions, all the stars are checked for
 ellipticity. Now some of these will have already been found
 to be elliptical when working at a higher contour level
 significance. Such stars are rechecked regardless, as the lower
 significance, larger, image may show up a better ellipticity. This
 rechecking of 'existing' doubles is however only done five times.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.4 <a name="shoulders"> Shoulders </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  Stars on the wings of brighter ones are searched for. These show up
  in the U-map image as long, narrow projections from the patches. At
  each lowering level, each image is searched for these projections.
  These projections are allowed down to a 9.5% probability level.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.5 <a name="weeding"> Weeding </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The stars found are weeded before output to remove spurious
 detections.
<p>
 
 This is done by:-
<p>
<ul>
<li> The final list is searched for stars which are too close
    to each other (separation less than 0.66*star radius). These
    are replaced by one star at the mean position.
<p>
 
<li> For CCD images, bright stars have linearity problems and/or
    saturated centres, and these centres should be marked by
    INVALID flag levels for all pixels above some level. These
    stars are then found to have a number of isolated patches
    in the U-map (since the centre itself has all the same values),
    and so a test is made for these saturated centres, and the
    possibly more than 1 stars found there are reduced to one.
<p>
 
<li> If an image was trailed or by some other cause has elongated
    images, then this program will tend to regard each image
    as a double and mark it as so. If desired, the star list
    is looked at for an excess of close doubles at the same
    angle and separation, and these are reset to be single stars.
</ol><p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.6 <a name="maximum number"> Maximum number </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 There is a user defined computer found star storage work space.
 This limits the number of stars that may be found. The default is
 10,000 stars. If more than this are found, the program stops.
 If more than this are found, the program stops. The resulting star
 list will have a non-complete and non-uniformly found content and
 should not be used as an reliable list. Although all the stars
 actually in it will be good ones, the found/not found distinction
 may vary with position, brightness, ellipticity, sky background,
 and presence of nearby stars in an unprdicatble way. If the
 max number of stars is found, then because of the weeding of close
 pairs and of multiple hits on large invalid areas, less than the
 maximum may be put out. Beware of thus thinking that all was ok
 just because of the fact that less than the maximum number were
 output.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 3 <a name="output"> Output </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
   The output table contains six columns. For each star, the entry is:-
<p>
<pre>
  Column  Contents
  ------  --------
  1       x posn
  2       y posn
  3       height above sky
  4       utest value as 100000.0*(1.0 - [u-test probablity])
  5       flag for 'STARFIND' type:-

           4:weeded ellipse centre
           11:single-inval 12:nip-inval 13:ell-inval
  6       elliptical companion number (=0 if none)
</pre><p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4 <a name="hidden_parameters"> Hidden parameters </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The parameters MAXNUM, USAVE, OUTIM, PLIMIT and WLIMIT are 'hidden',
  that is they are only accessible by putting 'STARFIND parameter=value'
  on the command line or by using a previous LET command.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 5 <a name="inform"> Inform </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The program can output progress information as it goes along.
  What is output to the terminal device by the program is set by
  the INFORM parameter. Thus:-
<p>
<pre>
 
 INFORM   Output information
 ------   ------------------
 None     None
 Some     Stages in the finding started and ended
 Lots     As for `some', but also more detailed
           information, such as the U-map level
           being looked at, and stars found
</pre><p>
 
  In the typed-out information when INFORM = `lots', those lines relating to
  star finds are similar to the rows in the output table. The
  star number is however not the same as in the output, as there is a
  sequence of finding which may affect earlier finds, and so disrupt the
  star numbering. Thus a found star may later in the program be decided
  to be:-
<p><ul>
<li>    - replaced by two stars since the found star is too elliptical
<li>    - removed as one of a number of false finds in an 'invalid' peak
<li>    - removed as being too close to another star
</ul>
<p>
 
  These last two removal processes also have their process informed to
  the terminal.

<hr>
 <h2> 6.10 <a name="skytype"> Skytype </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'local'            <br> Choice - 'local:mean:minimum')
<p>
 
  Method of making the sky map.
<p>
 
 The local sky level and sky level scatter has to be determined.
<p>
 
 This is done by making a 'sky map', that is a temporary image the
 same size as the input image, with its pixel values set to what the
 program thinks is the value of the background sky at that pixel.
<p>
 
 It also determines another sky map, which have the local values of
 (sky+scatter), where 'scatter' is the largest reasonable value the
 sky noise could add to the sky level in a pixel.
<p>
 
 These are determined in one of three ways:-
<p>
<dl>
 
<dt> <strong> `local' </strong>
<dd>  Subdividing the image into largeish (set
         by you, but suggested at 64x64) boxes, finding local modes and scatters,
          and then interpolating between these local modes by linear
          interpolation between the box centres. The scatter about the
          mode of the lowest mode is taken as the sky scatter.
<p>
 
          This is the default way.
<p>
 
<dt> <strong> `mean' </strong>
<dd>   Taking the input image as having a uniform background. The
          mode of the image is found, and the std dev about this mode
          found.
<p>
 
<dt> <strong> `minimum' </strong>
<dd>     Looking for the minimum pixel value and taking that as the
          sky level. The noise is taken as the std dev about the mode
          level of the whole image.
</dl><p>
 
 
 The default should be chosen unless there is smooth and
 significant change in the sky background (say from an elliptical
 galaxy which covers most of the image). If the change in the sky
 background is sharp, say from a globular cluster manifesting itself
 over 50 pixels, choose the default anyway.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 6.11 <a name="smear"> Smear </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'yes'        <br> Choice -  'yes/no')
<p>
 
   If an image was trailed or by some other cause has elongated
   images, then this program will tend to regard each image
   as a double and mark it as so. If desired (YES), the star list
   is looked at for an excess of close doubles at the same
   angle and separation, and these are reset to be single stars.

  (Default - 0.05        <br> Range - 0.0001 to 1.0)
<p>
 
  Hidden variable, only accessible from command line.
<p>
 
  The limit of probability that the difference between the area inside
  the search box and the area around it has arisen by chance and that
  there is not really a star at this position, FOR A POSITION WHICH HAS
  A SIGNAL VALUE of 2.5 std dev above the local sky. This is used for
  looking for stars on the wings of bright stars.
