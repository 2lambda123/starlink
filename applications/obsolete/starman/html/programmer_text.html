 A Programmer's Guide to Starman
<p>
 
 For the best guide, browse through the source code, with
 `starmanhyperhelp'.
 <p>
 
 Starman has evolved from the Interim environment ASPIC GRASP suite
 of programs, with the influence of the IRAF SPP programming language.
 It now runs under the Starlink ADAM environment.
<p>
 
 The aim has been to produce readable code, and to protect against
 future changes in the environment.
<p>
 
 Thus the code is written in what seems to me to be a nice and neat, but not
 too curt, style. Sub-routine calls to the outside world are insulated
 through subroutines, and all non-public domain libraries have been
 excluded.
<p>

 <h2> 2 <a name="use_of_the_adam_environmant"> Use of the ADAM environmant </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 To understand the basic rules of using the ADAM Environment, resd the
 Starlink document - Starlink Guide/4.
<p>
 
 All communication with the ADAM system goes through the routines
 in the `starflib&#95 adam.f' file. (Although IMPORT avoids this.) These
 routines provide simple interface calls for the programmer.
<p>
 
 The ADAM use of the `.ifl' interface files for communication with the
 outside world is normal.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 3 <a name="programming_style"> Programming style </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The style generally follows the IRAF SPP style. Features are:-
<p>

<ul>
 
<li> Use of include files with COMMON for passing numbers around the programs.
 
<li> Use of `implicit none' to check on varaibles.
 
<li> Use of a standard way of starting a subroutine -

<pre> 
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
C s/r name -- one line description
C    lines of description
C
C   author              institution              date
 
      subroutine name ( param1, param2, etc. )
 
      implicit none
      include files
 
      type       param1       !i: description
      type       param2       !o: description
C--
      types    work variables
Cbegin
 
      s/r code
</pre>
 
<li> The use of the ``--'' double minus sign indicates the start and
   end of the s/r description. So in no other location are two
   minus signs to be used.
 
<li> Extensive use of comments.
 
<li> Use of comments to be restricted to after column 80, preceeded
   by an exclamation mark. Sometimes comments starting from
   line 1 (with a ``C'') have to be present for readability.
 
<li> No sub-routine to extend over more than 200 lines (including
   start and comment lines).
 
<li> All programs to work as sub-routines to the ADAM system. Thus a
   program should start with a special subroutine whose only
   purposes are to be linked in with the ADAM `top' system, and in its
   turn call the real program, which starts with a subroutine
   of name `t&#95 PROGRAM', and to set up the Starman programming
   start values, and to translate those back to the ADAM system
   when leaving the programe

<pre> 
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
C `name' -- (Program) `one line description'
C
C   author              institution              date
 
      subroutine `name' ( ierradam )
 
      implicit none
 
      integer    ierradam       !o: ADAM error flag
C--
Cbegin
 
      call starman_start
 
      call t_`name'
 
      call starman_end ( ierradam )
 
      end
</pre>
 
<li> Use of a common `ST&#95 FAILED' variable to show program failure.
 
<li> Exit from s/rs on `ST&#95 FAILED' being set.
 
<li> Code to be in lower case.
 
<li> Indentation by three columns at each step.
 
<li> Variables in COMMON to be in upper case.
 
<li> Often used variables relating to images and tables to
   be given standard names and be loaded by the use
   of the `image.inc' and `table.inc' include files.
 
<li> The top level sub-routine to be mainly just a small set of
   calls to sub-routinesw which do the actual work.
</ul>

 <h2> 4 <a name="starman_general_sub-routines"> Starman general sub-routines </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 In the `/lib' sub-directory, there are a large number of subroutines
 which are used by more than one program. The programmer should
 browse through the files there.
<p>
 
 The routines which address the ADAM routines are kept in one file, the
 `starflib&#95 adam.f' file. There is also a file which has routines that whilst
 they are not too peculiar, do have some Unix specific calls and have
 thus been separated to ease in porting, into the file `starflib&#95 unix.f'.
<p>
 
 Amongst the routines are a number of sets of sub-routines which are of
 general use in writing programs. These general sets include:-
<p>

<dl> 
<dt> Typing out:
<dd>      There are two sr/s, printo which
      types out a line of text, and printd which does the same, but can
      insert variables in it, in the fashion of the C routine printf.
      To make that work, you need to start the program with pargbeg
      to set up the system. Then the routines parg(cilr) let you load
      character strings, integers, logicals and reals, which are then
      inserted in a printd s/r as
 
       call printd ( ' text %c %d %l %f ' )
 
<dt> Text:
<dd>      There are useful s/rs for dealing with text strings. These
      are lbgone, lens, charln, lowcase, uppcase.
 
<dt> Vector Arithmetic:
<dd>      Arrays of numbers may be simply manipulated with the routines found
      in `starflibv.f'.
      An example of this is call aaddr ( a, b, c, n ) which will add
      the two real arrays, `a' and `b', to produce the array `c', doing it for
      the first `n' items in the arrays. These routines do not deal with
      `magic' values.
 
<dt> Image I/O:
<dd>      Opening images for reading and writing
      is done with the opim(isur)(rw), opimz(rw),
      opim4zr, and opim4(irs)w routines (these in turn use the
      ADAM environment calls to do the actual work). Images are closed
      with the canpar routine. There are also routines for
      accessing descriptors of images, gtimzd, gtdes(cir),
      gtdesn, gtdesn&#95 gen, gtim(irs)d, ptdes(cir),
      gtdescn,
 
<dt>Table I/O:
<dd>      Opening tables for reading and writing
      is done with the optab(rw) routines (these in turn use the
      ADAM environment calls to do the actual work). Tables are closed
      with the canpar routine. There are also a number of routines
      for accessing names and headers in tables.
 
<dt> Parameter I/O:
<dd>       Getting parameters from the
      user are done with the get1(bcir)  and
      get(2345)(ir) routines. These
      parameters are cancelled with the canpar routine. Putting
      parameters is done with the put(123)(ir) routines. These
      routines in turn call ADAM ones.
 
<dt> Work Space:
<dd>      Work space is opened with the gtwrk(irs) routines, and closed
      with the wrkcan one.
 
<dt> Image Display:
<dd>     The image DS&#95  display routines work for X-windows.
     One can also use the PGPLOT routines through GKS
     to access other output devices
 
<dt> Graphics:
<dd>      There are routines which can be used
      as an interface to some of the PGPLOT routines, These are mainly to
      do with opening and closing devices, where it has been found
      useful to have them in a standard form. There are some other packs of
      PGPLOT routines that have been found useful.
 
<dt> Copying Arrays:
<dd>      There are a number of routines
      that copy data between arrays in a number of useful fashions.
 
<dt> Maths:
<dd>      There are a number of useful mathematical routines. These have been
      provided to escape from the straight-jacket of the NAG system, and
      thus make the suite portable. There is a complete `sort' set in
      these.

 <h2> 5 <a name="needed_outside_libraries"> Needed outside libraries </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The needed libraries, outside of those of Starman, are:-
<p>
 
<dl>
<dt> Graphics:
<dd>     The graphics works through PGPLOT. For the Starlink implementation,
     PGPLOT uses GKS and GNS libraries, and the EMS&#95  and CHR&#95  libraries.
 
<dt> Image Display:
<dd>     The image DS&#95  display routines work for X-windows. Thus the libraries for
     X drivers are needed. The PGPLOT routines are needed for the GKS
     calls in PGPLOT to access other output devices.
 
<dt> Astrometry:
<dd>      The Starlink SLALIB astrometry library.
 
</dl> 
 
<hr>
 <h2> 6 <a name="directory_structure"> Directory structure </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The main Starman directory contains Starman start script and the
 help file.
<p>
 
 The sub-directories contain:-

<dl>
 
<dt> /bin 
<dd> Executables and .ifl interface files
 
<dt> /`program' 
<dd>  Each sub-directory contains the code for one
      of the Starman programs, together with its makefile. These are not
      the general purpose image and table programs, which are in the
      /image and /table  sub-directories.
 
<dt> /image 
<dd>  Code for the `image' programs, for example
                       imcalc, imcut, etc.
 
<dt> /table 
<dd>  Code for the `table' programs, for example
                        tbcalc, tbcut, etc.
 
<dt> /lib 
<dd>  General purpose subroutines and subroutines to
                     access the ADAM environment.
 
<dt> /disp 
<dd>  Display subroutines.
 
<dt>/docs /help /hyper 
<dd>  Documentation
 
<dt> /build 
<dd> Package build under the Starlink system.
 
<dt> /monolith 
<dd>  Files for building the monolithic version.
</dl> 
 
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7 <a name="making_the_programs"> Making the programs </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 Starman uses the normal Unix  make system. It has its top level
 makefile.
<p>
 
 <h2> 7.1 <a name="monolith_version"> Monolith version </h2> </a> <p>
 

 To enable things to load quickly, all programs are statically linked.
 However, this does case problems in disk space, as each executable is large.
 To save on this disk space, all the programs can be loaded into one
 monolith, which is not much larger than a single executable.
<p>

 This does not mean that the programs can be used singly, as each program is
 set up as a separate (small) file, which then points to the monolith.
<p>

 This is loaded from the `/monolith' sub-directory, together with
 the `load&#95 monolith' script and the `mon&#95 link' in the `/bin'
 sub-directory.
<p>

 This makes the `starman&#95 mon' executable, with the `starman&#95 mon.ifl'
 interface file.
