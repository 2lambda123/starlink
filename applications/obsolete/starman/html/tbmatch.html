<h1> TBMATCH - <br>
 Extract entries with matching names in two tables
</h1>
<hr>
 
 
<p>
 
   This takes two tables and makes two new ones which are copies
   of the old ones, but only contain the entries which do (or
   optionally do not) have names which occur in the other table.
<p>
 
   If the choice is to have entries which do occur in both tables,
   then there is the choice to have those entries occur in the
   output tables either in the same order, or in the order that
   they appeared in their input tables, If the same order is chosen,
   the order is that of occurence in the first table. If there are
   repeated entries with the same names, then only the last such
   occurence is copied over. If the original order is chosen
   however, then those entries occur in the output tables in the
   same order as they occur in their respective input tables and
   repeated entries of the same name are all copied over.
<p>
 
   If the choice is to have entries which do not occur in both
   tables, then those entries occur in the output tables in the
   same order as they occur in their respective input tables.
   Repeated entries of the same name are all copied over.
