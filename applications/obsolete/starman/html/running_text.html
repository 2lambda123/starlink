Go to <a href="main.html"> Starman Help Main. </a>
<hr>

 Each of the programs in Starman can be run simply in the user's
 normal C Shell. Scripts can be written to combine programs or to
 run them repeatedly.
<p>

 You can also run the programs from inside the Starlink ICL environment.
<p>

 The programs have been written in the Starlink ADAM Environment. This
 has the advantage that there are a number of useful programs in the 
 KAPPA packages which supplement Starman, and that some of the Starman
 programs in turn are useful for current users of such packages.
<p>

 Particularly, the standard data format NDF is used. (You can see
 this as all data files have the '.sdf' suffixes.)
<p>
 
 Users wishing to know more about the  ADAM Environment and the
 KAPPA programs should read the relevant documents
 SG/4 and SUN/95.
