DIAGRAM - <br>
Plot CMDs and colour-colour diagrams
</h1>
 
 This plots out an HR or Two-Colour diagram from tables containing
 star magnitude data. It can also output a file containing the
 plotted values.
<p>
 
 There can be up to 48 input files open at once (if your computer set
 up allows this. Many systems will have lower limits).

 There are two options when running 'diagram', selected by your
 answer to the 'easycmd' parameter:-
<p>

<dl> 
<dt> 1) Easycmd='yes'
<p><dd>
 
    Do a standard run through to plot a CMD: -
<p>
 
    The program asks for the input to take two tables and put a CMD
    up on the x-windows window. The program then asks for further
    options, expecting the answer - 'exit'.
<p>
 
    If you put the `\\` on the command line, the program will then
    end, leaving the CMD displayed in its window.
<p>
 
    If you choose to continue, you will find yourself in the middle
    of 'easycmd=no' mode, being repeatedly asked what you want to do
    through the 'option' parameter. You should choose the 'panel'
    option, and then interact with the program through the 'panel'.
<p>
 
<p><dt> 2) Easycmd='no'
<p><dd>
 
 
    Do what you want: -
<p>
 
    The program first asks you if you want to plot a CMD or a
    colour-colour diagram. You choose, and then the program asks
    for what are the 'codes' of which colours to plot.
<p>
 
    After this, the program goes in the looping 'options' mode,
    repeatedly asking which option of action you want to do.
<p>
 
    It suggests a sequence of options which will normally get you
    the inputs needed for making and displaying the plot. If you
    accept these options all will go well. (You can, of course,
    choose diferent options if you wish to.)
<p>
 
    After this, all options are open. The program will suggest
    selecting the 'panel' option, where the options are available
    by pressing 'buttons' on a window. This is quite handy, and
    an in-screen help is displayed, as your cursor moves over the
    different buttons.
<p>
</dl>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2 <a name="method"> Method </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The program works on 'sets' of tables. Each set is loaded with data
 from (up to four) tables, each list of data of the magnitudes in a
 particular colour comes from a column of data in one of the tables.
 The tables with the data for an individual set must each contain the
 same stars in the same  order. Each set can hold up to 10 000 stars.
<p>
 
 Up to twelve sets can be handled.
<p>
 
 Only the data from one set is plotted out (or written to file) at
 any one time, but the other sets can accessed at will, and added
 to the diagram. They would however, if stored, be output to different
 files.
<p>
 
 The extent of the diagram (in the sense of the output values) is
 under user control, and the diagram can be cleared and plotting
 started again.
<p>
 
 The plotting and storing is done as 

<pre>
    CMDS               `col 'vs `col -col ' 
                           2        3    4 

    COLOUR_COLOUR:     `col -col  '  vs `col -col '
                           1    2           3    4
</pre>

 For example, as :-

<pre>
    V vs  B-V    or     R  vs  R-I     or     U-B vs B-V 
</pre>

  -  or any other single character descriptors which are
 assigned by you.
<p>
 
 Any single character descriptors may be assigned to the colours by the
 user.
<p>
 
 The location of points can be found using the cursor.
<p>
 
 Lines can also be drawn on the diagram from keyboard, cursor or
 file table posns.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 3 <a name="options"> Options </h2> </a> <p>

 The choice of action to do next is defined by the 'option'
 chosen. These options are also available through the 'panel'
 push-button mode, on choosing the 'panel' option.

  on the graph, place the cursor on the desired location, and
  press any keyboard key. To end, place the cursor to the left
  of the origin and press any key.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4 <a name="colour_equation_and_zero_point"> Colour equation and zero point </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 Each set can have its input magnitudes corrected by the following
 equation:-
<p>
<pre> 
        Col1  = Zero  + Col  + K .(C -C )
            n       n      n    n   3  4

 
 Where Col1  is the corrected version of input colour Col  and the
           n                                             n
 values Zero  and K  are input by the user. `n' runs from 2 to 4
            n      n
 for an HR type diagram, and from 1 to 4 for a Two-colour type
 diagram.
 
 As you can see, the colour correction is in terms of the `raw'
 magnitudes C  and C .
             3      4
</pre>

 

<hr>
 <h2> 5 <a name="cursor"> Cursor </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The plotting software package, PGPLOT,  defines the cursor movement
 and marking of position by the appropriate method for the device being
 used. If you are uncertain about how to use the cursor, ask your
 local computer expert.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 6 <a name="input"> Input </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 If a waveband is required twice (i.e. V in V vs B-V) the table and
 column with that waveband is only asked for once.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7 <a name="input_controls"> Input controls </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 Conditions may be imposed on which stars in a set are accepted
 for plotting. All stars are stored, but have an acceptance/rejection
 flag showing whether they would have been plotted.
<p>
 
 These are:-
<p>

<dl>
 
<dt>Raw magnitudes:      

<p><dd>  The acceptable range of input magnitudes in
         each input waveband in a set can be specified.
         (The default is 0.1 - 49.0.)

<p><dt>  No of good measures:  

<p><dd>  Sometimes a table containing a list of
         magnitudes will for each stars have an entry
         giving the number of estimates that made that
         magnitude. (This is the case for the Starman
         `Average' program output.) Optionally, a
         magnitude can be rejected if this number is
         less than a set limit for that waveband in
         that set. (The default is no checking.)

<p><dt>  Position in Diagram:  

<p><dd>  The output (to plot or file) processed
         magnitude/colour or colour/colour may be subject
         to a test for location as lying in given
         rectanglular region.
</dl>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 8 <a name="option_input"> Option input </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The options can be selected by responding at the keyboard to the
  'OPTION' question, or, if you are working at a X-window device, using
  a panel of buttons. These options are toggled by the 'panel'
  choice in the option list.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 9 <a name="plotting"> Plotting </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The symbols used to plot the data are under user control, and any of
 the standard PGPLOT symbols can be used.
<p>
 
 The graphical output is done using the PGPLOT package, and can
 thus be sent to any device that has a PGPLOT or GKS driver.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 10 <a name="output table"> Output table </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The contents of a row in the output file are:-
<p>
 
  -  Identifier; <p>
  -  X, Y;   (optionally) <p>
  -  col(2) or col(1)-col(2); <p>
  -  col(3)-col(4); <p>
  -  input waveband magnitude <p>
  -  number of good estimates in that magnitude <p>
<p>
 
 The first two columns (the 'x' and 'y') are optional. Their presence
 is controlled by the 'storexy' parameter.
<p>
 
 The last two entries are repeated for each of the input magnitudes.
<p>
 
 This is a Starman NDF format table.

 (This does not affect the output to a table.)
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.7 <a name="easycmd"> Easycmd </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - 'yes'                 Choice - 'yes:no')
<p>
 
 There are two options when running 'diagram', selected by your
 answer to the 'easycmd' parameter:-
<p>
 
<dl> 
<dt> 1) Easycmd='yes'
<p><dd>
 
    Do a standard run through to plot a CMD: -
<p>
 
    The program asks for the input to take two tables and put a CMD
    up on the x-windows window. The program then asks for further
    options, expecting the answer - 'exit'.
<p>
 
    If you put the `\\` on the command line, the program will then
    end, leaving the CMD displayed in its window.
<p>
 
    If you choose to continue, you will find yourself in the middle
    of 'easycmd=no' mode, being repeatedly asked what you want to do
    through the 'option' parameter. You should choose the 'panel'
    option, and then interact with the program through the 'panel'.
<p>
 
<p><dt> 2) Easycmd='no'
<p><dd>
 
 
    Do what you want: -
<p>
 
    The program first asks you if you want to plot a CMD or a
    colour-colour diagram. You choose, and then the program asks
    for what are the 'codes' of which colours to plot.
<p>
 
    After this, the program goes in the looping 'options' mode,
    repeatedly asking which option of action you want to do.
<p>
 
    It suggests a sequence of options which will normally get you
    the inputs needed for making and displaying the plot. If you
    accept these options all will go well. (You can, of course,
    choose diferent options if you wish to.)
<p>
 
    After this, all options are open. The program will suggest
    selecting the 'panel' option, where the options are available
    by pressing 'buttons' on a window. This is quite handy, and
    an in-screen help is displayed, as your cursor moves over the
    different buttons.
<p>
</dl>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.8 <a name="exit"> Exit </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'yes'               Choice - 'yes:no')
<p>
 
  Do you want to exit from the program?
<p>
 
  This is asked for, if the program is in the 'easycmd=yes' mode,
  and has plotted the CMD.
<p>
 
  This is defaulted to 'yes', so that if the command line has the
  '\\' input giving that defaults be taken, then the program ends,
  as it should.
<p>
 
  If the command line does not have this, then it is up to the
  user whether to continue.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.9 <a name="gtype"> Gtype </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'xwindows'            Choice - any)
<p>
 
  A character string giving the local name for the graphics
  display type.
<p>
 
  'xwindows' will put it out on the screen of your X-window device,
  if you are using one.
<p>
 
  If 'ask' is input, then the program asks a very similar question,
  in a different way. A response here of '?' will bring up a listing
  of all the possible names of graphics devices which are supported
  on your machine, and you then input the appropriate name.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.10 <a name="hilim"> Hilim </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - 49.0 or last value input    Range - -1.0e10 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
 Stars in this file with input magnitude  fainter than this
 are not accepted.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.11 <a name="intab"> Intab </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - null)
<p>
 
 If `file' is chosen in `TYLINE' parameter option, then a table with
 the points defining the line is needed. This table should have two
 columns with 'x' and 'y' values in it. The numbers of these columns
 are input with the 'PCOLUMN' parameter.
<p>
 
 One can use the 'offsets' parameter to shift this line an x and y.
<p>
 
 This table must be in the Starman NDF table format.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.12 <a name="in"> In </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - null)
<p>
 
 An input file containing a table with one column having magnitudes.
<p>
 
 
 This can be one of 48 input files from IN1 to IN48.
 They are used in sets of four (e.g. IN1,IN2,IN3,IN4) for a 'set'
 of (up to) four tables of input colours to make an array of points for
 the colour-magnitude or colour-colour diagram. If only two or three
 input magnitudes are needed, then not all of (IN1,IN2,IN3,IN4) will
 be used. The next set of data would then use the parameters (IN5,IN6,
 IN7,IN8), and so on. Thus 12 sets in all can be input.
<p>
 
 This table must be in the Starman NDF table format.
<p>
 
 This is the help for the 'IN1', 'IN2', ... 'IN48' parameters.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.13 <a name="linecol"> Linecol </h2> </a> <p>
 
   (Default - 'black'            Choice - (black:white)
<p>
 
    Colour of plot lines. This is determined by whether you have a
    black or white background to your plots.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.14 <a name="lolim"> Lolim </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - 0.1 or last value input           Range - -1.0e10 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
 Stars in this file with  input mag brighter than this
 are not accepted.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.15 <a name="ncolumn"> Ncolumn </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - 0            Range - 1 to no of columns in table)
<p>
 
 The column in the table that contains the number of good estimates
 of the star magnitudes. If no such column exists, or use of it is
 not desired, input `0'.
<p>
 
 This is used for `NCOL1', `NCOL2', `NCOL3', `NCOL4'.
 refering to the (up to) four input tables in the set.  (12 sets in
 all allowed.)
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.16 <a name="numbutt"> Numbutt </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - see below          Range - 2 to 3)
<p>
 
  Number of `X-Window' buttons available on the mouse.
<p>
 
  Some devices have two and some have three buttons available. This
  can depend both on their actual presence, and also on the X Windows
  software that is being run.
<p>
 
  With three buttons, then the Starman programs use all three, with
  the right-hand button being used mainly as the 'exit' button.
<p>
 
  With two buttons, then the third button is simulated by pressing
  both of the buttons down, with the middle one being pressed slightly
  BEFORE the left-hand one. Use of the middle button in its normal
  way has to be modified, in that one has to pause for half a second
  after using it.
<p>
 
  [This parameter is usally 'hidden', with the machine manager setting
   it to the appropriate value for the local set-up. Sometimes it will
   be left to the user to set, depending on his software
   configuartion.]
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.17 <a name="numgood"> Numgood </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - 0 or last value input       Range - 1 to 100000)
<p>
 
 If using this input control, this is the minimum no of estimates
 used in making the star mag for a star in the input file
 that is acceptable. Any star with fewer that that for the
 mag in this file is ignored.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.18 <a name="offsets"> Offsets </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - 0.0,0.0             Range - -1.0e10 to 1.0e10)
<p>
 
 The 'x' and 'y' offsets to be added to the data in the 'INTAB'
 table for plotting.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.19 <a name="option"> Option </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - last chosen in list below.  Choice  - see list below)
<p>
 
 The choice of action to do next is defined by the 'option'
 chosen. These options are also available through the 'panel'
 push-button mode, on choosing the 'panel' option.

 <h2> 11.20 <a name="out"> Out </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - null)
<p>
 
 The Output table for storing the results.
<p>
 
 This is a Starman NDF format table
<p>
 
 The contents of a row in the output file are:-
<p>
 
  -  Identifier; <p>
  -  X, Y;   (optionally) <p>
  -  col(2) or col(1)-col(2); <p>
  -  col(3)-col(4); <p>
  -  input waveband magnitude <p>
  -  number of good estimates in that magnitude <p>
<p>
 
 The first two columns (the 'x' and 'y') are optional. Their presence
 is controlled by the 'storexy' parameter.
<p>
 
 The last two entries are repeated for each of the input magnitudes.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.21 <a name="pcolumn"> Pcolumn </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - 1,2     Choice - 2 integers in the range 1 to no of columns)
<p>
 
  If `file' is chosen in `TYLINE' option, these  are the numbers of
  the two columns in the table containing respectively the 'x' and the
  'y' values which are to be plotted as a line.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.22 <a name="set"> Set </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - present value    Range - 1 to No of sets input)
<p>
 
 The number defining which of the input sets of (up to) four
 tables to deal with. Up to twelve sets can be kept.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.23 <a name="storexy"> Storexy </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - 'yes'       Choice - 'yes:no')
<p>
 
  If yes, then the input file will contain in its first two columns,
  the X and Y positions of the stars, and you desire that these should
  be output to the output table.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.24 <a name="symbol"> Symbol </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - 1 or last value input     Range - 1 to 128)
<p>
 
 The PGPLOT symbol code that defines the shape of the symbol
 plotted.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.25 <a name="title"> Title </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - Input file title or `Output from Diagram'     Choice - any)
<p>
 
 The content of the 'title' header in the output table.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 11.26 <a name="tyline"> Tyline </h2> </a> <p>
 
 (Default - 'return'     Choice - 'cursor:table:keyboard:return')
<p>
 
 Flag for method of putting line on diagram.
<p>
 
 When a method is chosen, the line is plotted, and this question is
 asked again.
<p>
 
 Points given by the various inputs are plotted as joined together
 with straight lines.
<p>
 
<pre>
 Choice     Action
 ------     ------
 cursor     Line is drawn joining the successive locations 
            marked with the cursor, until a location less than 
            the minimum `x' value of the graph is chosen, when 
            this cursor entry stops.
 
 table      An input table of x and y positions is asked for, 
            via the 'intab' parameter. These are plotted.
 
 keyboard   The user types in pairs of 'x','y' positions, and 
            these are plotted. This is stopped by the user 
            inputting an 'x' position to the left of the graph 
            edge.
 
 return     Return to the 'options/'panel' mode.

 The acceptable range of the value of the output 'x' colour,

<pre>
 (col1 - col1 )
      3      4
</pre>
 
 that a star may have. If it lies outside this range,
 then it will not be plotted, and it will be stored with a warning
 flag.

 `x',`y' posn to make line plot to.
<p>
 
 (This is only used in the `keyboard' option of the `tyline' choice
 in the 'line' option.input.
<p>
 
 If the 'x' value input is less than the minimum value that can be
 displayed then the keyboard entry is halted, otherwise the next
 position is asked for.
