<h1> IMJOIN - <br>
 Join a number of images together
</h1>
<hr>
 
 
<p>
 
 This program is used to merge several images into one new image.
<p>
 
 The key features are:-
<p>
<ul>
<li> The addition of each image is done in such a way that the
     each pixel in the output image has the `weighted' contribution
     from each input image.
<p>
 
<li> The input images can be `transformed', that is given a
     displacement, rotation, and stretch in the XY plane.
<p>
 
<li> For each image, the pixel values can have a zero level
     subtracted and can be scaled before being added into the output
     image.
</ul><p>
 
 The program can, less usually, combine two `reference' images.
<p>
 
 The output can be an `real' 32-bit image or a `short' 16-bit
 integer image, or a real 32-bit `reference' image.
<p>
 
 The reference image can contain more information than the simple
 output image, and is accompanied by a `load' image, which means it
 can be input into IMJOIN again without loosing any information.

 <h2> 1 <a name="method"> Method </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 This program is intended for the purpose of making a large image from
 a number of images.
<p>
 
 The input images can be placed in a normal output image or as an
 output `reference' image. The reference image can either then be used
 as a normal image (but see the comment in the `Details' help section),
 or used as a further input to another run of IMJOIN.
<p>
 
 <strong> 1) A Simple Point </strong>
<p>
 
 If the input images were simply added in, then when images overlapped
 the output pixels would have double inputs and be too high. This
 problem is solved by some simple arithmetic.
<p>
 
 It works by adding image(s) into a `reference' image.
<p>
 
 The reference image has an accompanying `load' image which records for
 each pixel how many input images have contributed to that pixel. Thus
 a new input pixel value gets added in to give the output value as:-
<p>
<pre>
 
            OUT_VAL.(Present number of inputs) + IN_VAL
 OUT_VAL =  -------------------------------------------
                  Present number of inputs + 1
</pre><p>
 
 
<strong>  2) Scaling the Input Images </strong>
<p>
 
 There is a further facility, in that the input images may have
 different `scales'. Thus if there are two images which have different
 exposure times, then simply adding them in together will result in
 mismatched pixels.
<p>
 
 This is solved by applying a `scale' to each input image.
<p>
 
 When the new image is added in, each pixel that gets a value from the
 new image is scaled by a factor. Each pixel is multiplied by this
 scale factor. Then at the end the output pixel is divided by the sum
 of the `scales'. Thus if the scaling were due, in fact, to different
 exposure times, the `scale' could be inversely proportional to the
 exposure times.
<p>
 
 Since the scale is multiplied into the pixel values, it is recommended
 that the longest exposure have a `scale' of 1.0, and the others in
 proportion. This avoids loosing accuracy when the output image (which
 is real) is later converted back to a short integer one.
<p>
 
 Thus a pixel, from an input image of the `SCALE' parameter of IN&#95 SCALE,
 with a pixel value of IN&#95 VAL will be added to a reference image pixel
 of `scale SCALE&#95 VAL and value REF&#95 VAL so that the output pixel value
 will be:-
<p>
<pre>
 OUT_VAL = (REF_VAL.SCALE_VAL + IN_VAL)/(SCALE_REF + IN_SCALE)
</pre><p>
 
 and the output `scale' image will be:-
<p>
<pre>
 OUT_SCALE = SCALE_VAL + IN_SCALE
</pre><p>
 
 
<strong>  3) Subtracting a Zero from the Images </strong>
<p>
 
 There is a facility for subtracting a mean `zero' level from each input
 image before the process of scaling, transforming and inputting starts.
<p>
 
 This is useful when the input images have been taken under different
 conditions of sky brightness and each has an extra, uniform,
 contribution from the sky background. This level can be automatically
 estimated and subtracted from the image.
<p>
 
 This is not a good idea when there is large scale structure truly
 present in the imagea, as a mean level from this in each image will
 also be subtracted, leading to strange effects.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2 <a name="pixel_interpolation"> Pixel interpolation </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  As the transformation coefficents do not necessarily result in
  each pixel in an input image corresponding exactly to the pixel
  locations in the output image, it is necessary to interpolate
  between the input pixels to see what value to put into the
  output pixel.
<p>
 
  This interpolating from the grid of input image pixels onto the
  output image can be done in one of three ways:-
<p>
<dl>
<dt>  NEAREST  <dd>  Take the nearest input image pixel.
<p><dt>  LINEAR   <dd>  Make a linear combination of the four input image
              pixels around the output image pixel.
<p><dt>  UNIFORM  <dd>  Make a weighted mean of the nine adjacent input image
              pixels (linearly combined), so that the ouput image pixels
              have a constant noise value.
</dl><p>
 
  The default is LINEAR.
<p>
 
 The NEAREST method is the simplest, and actually no interpolation is
 done.
<p>
 
 All interpolation methods have the drawback that they will miss high
 and low points `between' the pixels. Thus if there is structure on a
 scale commensurate with the pixel sizes, there will tend to be a
 smoothing of the high and low points. Thus, an image with stars in it
 runs the risk that the star peaks will be smoothed down.
<p>
 
 A drawback with `LINEAR' is that an output pixel in the centre of four
 input pixels will be the mean of those, and thus have a lower noise
 than an output pixel on an input pixel, in which case it would only
 have the mean of that single pixel. Thus the provision of the `UNIFORM'
 mode.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 3 <a name="reference_image_adding"> Reference image adding </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 It sometimes happens that one has run IMJOIN twice, and one wants to
 combine the two resultant `reference' and `load' images. This can be
 done.
<p>
 
 The combining is done assuming that the images are already exactly
 aligned. The output `reference' and `load' images are made, dealing
 with the `weights' in the proper manner.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4 <a name="transformation"> Transformation </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The `transformation' of the input image pixel locations into the
 output images pixel locations is done with a linear transformation.
<p>
 
 Thus:-
<p>
<pre>
     x1 = c1 + c2.x + c3.y
     y1 = c4 + c5.x + c6.y
 
</pre>
 where: <br>
        (x,y) are the coordinates in the input image. <br>
        (x1,y1) are the coordinates in the output `reference' image,
<p>
 
  The default is no translation, rotation or stretching:-
<p>
<pre>
 
     x1 = 0.0 + 1.0*x + 0.0*y
     y2 = 0.0 + 0.0*x + 1.0*y
</pre><p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 5 <a name="details"> Details </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The input reference, input load, output reference, and output load
 images are all `real' (32 bit). The input image, and the output image
 can be either `real' or `short' 16-bit integer.
<p>
 
 If there is no input reference image, then a default null one is
 assumed, with a default null load image.
<p>
 
 `Invalid' pixels in an input image are not transferred over to the
 corresponding pixel in the output image, unless that pixel has had no
 valid input data yet. If an output image pixel has had only `invalid'
 input image pixels, and then a new input image delivers a valid
 pixel value, that overwrites the `invalid' flag in the output pixel.
<p>
 
 Up to ten input images can be used. If it is desired to load more
 than ten, then run the program again.
<p>

 <h2> 6 <a name="warnings"> Warnings </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  This program can seem very slow or inoperative, because of the
  number and sizes of the files used/made. Also the size of the
  output files may be larger than you expect.

<dt>  `short' <dd>  This is a 16-bit integer image, with a precision of about
