  Method of smoothing:-
<p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>   box <dt></strong>
<dd>     Applies a 'top-hat' smoothing, running a rectangular
           box over the image, calculating the average of this box,
           and applying that value at the pixel. Clearly the box
           must have sides of an odd number of pixels, so that the
           box is centered on the pixel.
<p>
 
<dt><strong>   median  <dt></strong>
<dd>       Applies a median smoothing, running a rectangular
           box over the image, calculating the median of this box,
           and applying that value at the pixel. Clearly the box
           must have sides of an odd number of pixels, so that the
           box is centered on the pixel.
<p>
 
<dt><strong>   gauss   <dt></strong>
<dd>       Applies a Gaussian smoothing, running a rectangular
           box over the image, calculating for the pixel at the centre
           of the box what contribution it makes to the individual
           pixels in the box, if were spread by a Gaussian point-spread-
           function. (This is scaled so that the total contributions
           to all the pixels in the box sum to the original pixel
           value. Thus a flat image would give an identical output image.)
           Clearly the box must have sides of an odd number of pixels, so
           that the box is centered on the pixel.
</dl><p>
 
  The problem of the edge of the image, for both methods is dealt with
  by assuming that the input image 'spreads' out beyond its limits, with
  the values at the edges.
<p>
 
  `Invalid' pixels in the rectangular box are ignored, unless they
  are all invalid, in which case the output value is set as invalid.

 <h2> 2.1 <a name="box"> Box </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 3,3        <br> Range - 1 to max side of image)
<p>
 
  The XY size of the rectangular box sued in 'top-hat'
  smoothing. The sides must have an odd number of pixels.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.2 <a name="gbox"> Gbox </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 10*rad,10*rad    <br> Range - 1 to max side of image)
<p>
 
  The XY size of the rectangular box sued in 'gaussian'
  smoothing. The sides must have an odd number of pixels.
<p>
 
  'rad' here is the Gaussian radius of the smoothing function.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.3 <a name="gradius"> Gradius </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 2.0              <br> range - 1.0e-5 to 1.0e5)
<p>
 
 Radius of the Gaussian to use in the Gaussian smoothing.
<p>
 
 This is radius at which the profile is 1/e of its peak height.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.4 <a name="in"> In </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - null)
<p>
 
  The name of the input image file.
<p>
 
  The input image must be a standard Starman ADAM .SDF image, with
  either `real' 32-bit real values, or `short' 16-bit integer values.
  It can have the `BSCALE' and `BZERO' values, and `magic pixel values'
  indicating `bad' pixels.
<p>

 <h2> 2.5 <a name="method"> Method </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'box'         <br> Choice - 'gauss:box:median')
<p>
 
  Method of smoothing.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>   box <dt></strong>
<dd>     Applies a 'top-hat' smoothing, running a rectangular
           box over the image, calculating the average of this box,
           and applying that value at the pixel. Clearly the box
           must have sides of an odd number of pixels, so that the
           box is centered on the pixel.

           and applying that value at the pixel. Clearly the box
           must have sides of an odd number of pixels, so that the
           box is centered on the pixel.

           box over the image, calculating for the pixel at the centre
           of the box what contribution it makes to the individual

 <h2> 2.6 <a name="out"> Out </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - null)
<p>
 
  The name of the new file containing the output image.
<p>
 
  The output image will be a standard Starman ADAM .SDF image, with
  the same type as the input image, either `real' 32-bit real values,
  or `short' 16-bit integer values.
  It will have the `BSCALE' and `BZERO' values, and `magic pixel values'
  indicating `bad' pixels, of the input image
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.7 <a name="title"> Title </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - input image title, or if null, 'Output from Imsmooth'
   Choice  - any)
<p>
 
  Title to add to output image
<p>
