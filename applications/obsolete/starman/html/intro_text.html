 Starman has been constructed as a package of programs to aid the reduction of
 globular-cluster stellar photometry. After the programs that deal with the
 actual measuring of star magnitudes were written, it became apparent that it
 was necessary to have a large number of other programs to support those core
 programs, if actual astronomy was to be done. Thus the package has became
 capable of dealing with many of the diverse problems that occur when
 performing stellar photometry on images. For this reason, it has became
 worth releasing to the community as a general purpose stellar-photometry
 tool.
<p>

 In the `support' component of the Starman package, there are a number of
 general purpose programs for image and table handling and for display.
 These are thus useful in other, non-stellar-photometry, astronomical data
 reduction studies.
