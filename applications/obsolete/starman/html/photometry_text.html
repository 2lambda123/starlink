 The <i> Starman </i> package provides the tools for doing stellar 
 photometry. However the
 user will also need some expertise in doing photometry if he or she is to
 use the tools properly. The amount of expertise one needs to do such
 photometry depends on the accuracy desired and the precise type of
 photometry being done. <i> Starman </i> provides the 
 <i> tools </i> for photometry, but
 cannot provide the <i> expertise</i>. A sub-section of this help lists some
 <a href="#further_reading"> further reading </a> that might be 
 useful for novices in photometry.

  I do have it in mind to write a guide, but the funding
  of astronomy is not sufficent to let me spend too much time on this
  right now. <p>

  There are a number of useful references. See the section on

 There is a major photometry mode, that of the `Classical' Photo-Electric
 photometry mode (with data either from P-E photometers or CCDs). This mode
 is one where a (possibly large) number of individual magnitude estimates
 are made during a night, each of a single star, scattered over the sky,
 and it is desired to reduce them to a standard-magnitude system. Starman
 cannot deal efficiently with  reducing magnitudes made in this mode.
<p>
 
 There is the <i> Starman </i> program AUTOMAG which is designed 
 to take CCD
 images and do part of this work, looking up standard magnitudes and
 allowing for extinction. However the output from that program needs
 extensive further work, such as allowing for errors in the night's
 extinction, allowing for colour, time, and/or azimuth dependent
 extinction, determining colour equations. If there is only a limited
 amount of such data, this further work can be done by hand. If a large
 amount has to be reduced, then special purpose programs need to be
 written by the user.
