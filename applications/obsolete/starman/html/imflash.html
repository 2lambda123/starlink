<h1> IMFLASH -  Simple display of image
</h1>
<hr>
 
 
<p>
 
  IMFLASH displays an image on an image display with a minimum
  of interaction with the user. It 'flashes' an image up on the
  screen. This stays displayed until the user inputs that it
  should disappear.
<p>
 
  The program calculates the `best' contrast to display the image
  at. This assumes that much of the image is sky with some noise.
  The display is -2/+5 std dev about the mean. This brings up
  faint features.
<p>
 
  The image is displayed in black and white, with black denoting
  high values. `Invalid' pixels are displyed as white.
<p>
 
  If the image is too large to be displayed on the image, it is binned
  down (with square bins), so that it does fit into the display.
<p>
 
  The image disappears when the user ends the program. Thus if you
  want to have an image displayed, while you do something else, then
  leave the image displayed, and start another window, start Starman
  there, and do what you want to do there.

  (Default - 'yes'      <br> Choice - 'yes:no')
<p>
 
  Have you had enough of looking at the image?
<p>
 
  If you have, then the program will exit, and the image will vaish
  from the screen.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 1.2 <a name="in"> In </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - null)
<p>
 
  The name of the file containing the input image.
<p>
 
  The input image must be a standard Starman ADAM .SDF image, with
  either `real' 32-bit real values, or `short' 16-bit integer values.
  It can have the `BSCALE' and `BZERO' values, and `magic pixel values'
  indicating `bad' pixels.
