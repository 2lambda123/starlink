 <h2> 1 <a name="automag"> Introduction </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  This does simple aperture photometry on stars in an image. It works
  automatically, finding the stars, doing the aperture photometry and
  outputting the results. It uses the (optional) presence of an
  exposure time descriptor to correct the magnitude to that for a
  1 second exposure.
<p>
 
  It can also, depending on the presence of the appropriate information
  in the image descriptors and the users wish:-
<p>
 
<ul>
<li> Find the Zenith distance (either from the image or a standards file)
<li> Find the Filter used
<li> Apply the extinction correction
<li> Look up the object name in a file and find the appropriate
      standard magnitude, which it then compares to the measured magnitude
<li> Output results to a text file as well as the terminal
</ul>
 
  It works best if the stars are widely dispersed in the image.
  A density of one star per 100x100 pixel area is fine, although
  somewhat higher densities are acceptable.

 <h2> 2 <a name="method"> Method </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  <h3> Measuring the stars </h3><p>
 
  It finds stars as groups of pixels which are more than a certain value
  above the sky level. It then finds the centre of these groups, and puts
  an aperture round them, giving the flux in the aperture. It then
  finds the sky level in up to four apertures located around the star,
  finds the mean sky level, deducts that from the star aperture flux, to
  give the star flux.
<p>
 
  This flux is then turned into a magnitude by the formula
<p>
 
<pre>
               Magnitude = 30.0 - 2.5*log  (flux)
                                         10
</pre>
 
  <h3> Correcting for exposure time </h3><p>
 
  This magnitude is then corrected for the exposure time. The flux
  is changed to that it would have had in a 1 second exposure, that is
<p>
 
<pre>
               Magnitude = magnitude + 2.5*log (exp time)
                                              10
</pre>
 
  <h3> Correcting for extinction </h3> <p>
 
  If the user desires, then the magnitude can be corrected for extinction.
<p>
 
  This is done by taking the RA and Dec and Sidereal time from the image
  descriptors, and working out the Sec Z of the exposure. Then the filter
  that was used in the exposure is found from an image descriptor, and
  used with the extinction input by the user for such a filter to work
  out the extinction.
<p>
 
  The Sec Z is worked out in first order terms as:-
<p>
 
<pre>
 
                                 1.0
      SecZ =  ------------------------------------------
              sin(lat)*sin(dec)+cos(lat)*cos(dec)*cos(ha)
</pre>
 
  A corrected magnitude is then worked out as:-
<p>
 
<pre>
            Magnitude = magnitude - Extinction*(SecZ-1.0)
</pre>
 
 
  It is possible to get the image RA and Dec not from the image
  descriptors, but from the standards file. In this case the
  star name in the image descriptors is taken, and that name looked
  for in the standards file.
<p>
 
 
<h3> Checking against a standard magnitude </h3> <p>
 
  If the user desires, the standard magnitude of the star in the
  waveband used may be found from the input standards file. In this
  case, the star name in the image descriptors is taken, and that
  name looked for in the standards file. The magnitude in the
  waveband used, for that star is then output, together with the
  difference between the `observed' magnitude and the standard
  magnitude.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.1 <a name="date"> Date </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 If a standard magnitude file is used, then the user has to input the
 date of the exposure. This is because there is no standard format
 for date formats. It should be input in format YYYY/MM/DD. A default
 reply is acceptable.
<p>
 
 The date is used for the precession of the standard star positions
 to the date of the observation.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.2 <a name="error"> Error </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The error in the output magnitude is calculated.
<p>
 
 The calculations are done on the assumption that the pixel values in
 the image are the result of a Poissonian noise signal. There are two
 modifiers to this. First, that the numbers in the image have been scaled,
 so that a gain is needed to reconstruct the original Poissonian values.
 Second, that an extra source of noise has been added to each pixel. Thus
 if a pixel has a raw value of k (and the image has scale of BSCALE, and
 zero of BZERO), then the true pixel value is BSCALE.k + BZERO. Then if
 the Poissonian gain is GAIN, and the extra noise is NOISE, the noise in
 the pixel is:-
<p>
 
<pre>
        square root[GAIN.(BSCALE.k+BZERO) + NOISE.NOISE]
</pre>
 
 Following on from this assumption, the error in the star magnitude
 is calculated as:-
<p>
 
  The variance of the sky estimate is:-
 
<pre>
 varsky = [(BSCALE.skyfl+BZERO).GAIN + skypix.NOISE.NOISE]
          ------------------------------------------------
                               skypix
</pre>
 
 The variance of the star estimate is then:-
 
<pre>
 varstar = (BSCALE.starfl+BZERO).GAIN + starpix.NOISE.NOISE
            + starpix.varsky
</pre>
 
  The RMS star error is then:-
 
<pre>
 err = sqrt(varstar)/((BSCALE.starfl+BZERO)*GAIN)
 RMS = 2.5.alog10(1.0+err)
 
 where   skyfl   = total flux in all used sky apertures
         starfl  = total flux in star aperture
         skypix  = total no of pixels in all used sky apertures
         starpix = no of pixels in star aperture
</pre>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.3 <a name="exposure"> Exposure </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The exposure time is used for correcting the magnitude of the star.
 This is done by calculating the flux that the star would have had
 if the exposure had been 1 second long.
<p>
 
 The actual exposure time used in this calculation is not
 necessarily that in the image descriptor. First of all the image
 exposure time descriptor is read, and then offered to the user as
 the default exposure time. The user can then accept this, or input
 any value she likes. The point of allowing the user to do this is
 that sometimes the time loaded in the exposure time descriptor is
 missing or wrong.
<p>
 
 There is then added an extra time, input by the user via the 'EXPOFF'
 parameter, to give the final adopted exposure time. This extra offset,
 which is added to all the times of the images measured, is intended
 to allow for shutter timing mechanisms which introduce an offset
 between the actual and recorded exposure times.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.4 <a name="star_ra_and_decs"> Star RAs and Decs </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The program takes the position of the star either to be the
 position in the standards file, precessed to the date of the
 observation, or the RA, Dec of the image as noted in its header.
 This second method depends on the telescope pointing being good
 and the offset of the star in the image from the (RA,Dec)
 reference point not to be too large.
<p>
 
 If both the standard file and image position descriptors are
 present, then the user has the option of deciding which will
 be used to determine the position.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.5 <a name="sec_z"> Sec z </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The Sec Z is worked out in first order terms as:-
<p>
<pre>
 
                              1.0
 SecZ =    -----------------------------------------------
           sin(lat)*sin(dec)+cos(lat)*cos(dec)*cos(ra-sidt)
</pre>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.6 <a name="sky_levels"> Sky levels </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  <hr> Level in a single aperture </h3><p>
 
 The sky levels are calculated for each sky aperture. All 'good'
 pixels are taken in the area, and the mean taken.
<p>
 
 It is important that this is the mean, because these sky levels
 will be used to subtract a sky from the star aperture. If a
 value was used which discarded high values (due to faint stars),
 such as medians or other methods, then there will be a systematic
 error introduced into the star magnitudes.
<p>
 
 This is because there will be faint stars in the star aperture
 and these will be simply added in, so the same proceedure must
 be used for the sky apertures.
<p>
 
 The problem of a bright star falling by chance in a sky aperture
 is dealt with in the averaging described below.
<p>
 
<h3> Mean level used </h3><p>
 
 When more than one sky aperture is used, then a mean level is
 calculated. For the case of two apertures, a simple mean is
 taken. For three or four apertures, the two apertures whose
 levels are closest together is taken, and then any other
 aperture whose level is within a user input fractional tolerance
 of that level. The default value for this tolerance is 0.1 of the
 star flux. The value used is input through AVLIM.
<p>
 
 Then the mean is made from the selected apertures.
<p>
 
<h3> Record of differences </h3><p>
 
 To see if any of the apertures is contaminated (say by a bright
 star), the magnitudes that would have been calculated if each
 aperture in turn was taken as the sole sky level is calculated.
 The differences of these from the actually calculated mean is
 calculated and typed out (as the 'Sk1', 'Sk2', etc.). So the
 user can see from these if there was any contamination that has
 disturbed the mean.
<p>
 
 If there are more than two apertures, often only one is contaminated,
 and this is thrown out by the averaging process described above. So
 the mean may well be correct. A good indicator of this is that two or
 three of the apertures show very good agreement with the mean, and
 one is distant from it. This tells you that the mean was made without
 the discordant aperture.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.7 <a name="sky_locations"> Sky locations </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The number and location of the sky apertures is defined by the
  user. Up to four apertures may be used. These are distributed
  in an X-Y frame around the star aperture, where the X-Y offsets
  give the X-Y distances in pixels between the star aperture
  centre and the sky aperture centres.
<p>
 
  The default is a star aperture diameter of 40 pixels, and four
  sky apertures, each of 20 pixels diameter, located to the left
  right, up and down from the star aperture with star-sky
  centre distances of 40 pixels. Thus the sky apertures come within
  10 pixels of the star aperture.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.8 <a name="star_finding"> Star finding </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The program finds stars by looking for blocks of pixels above the
  sky level.
<p>
 
  The position found by the program is the centroid of the contiguous
  pixels above the threshold level above the overall image sky level.
  This centroid gives equal weight to all these pixels, regardless
  of their pixel values. The search for contiguous pixels is only
  done in a box of size which is input by the user (with a default of
  side 100 pixels). This box is such that the first pixel found
  (in a search along X lines, goin up in the Y direction line-by-line),
  is centered in the box in the X direction, and at the bottom of
  the box in the Y direction.
<p>
 
  If the star images are reasonably in focus, then it is possible
  to refine this position by fitting a Gaussian with a variable
  profile at that location.
<p>
 
  This gives a more accurate centering, but has the risk that the
  star image may be so strange as to cause the Gaussian fitting
  subroutine to fail catastrophically.
<p>
 
  Also if the stars are not in focus, then the fit may well fail
  or give the wrong position.
<p>
 
  Stars with positions within a box of side 16 pixels centered on any
  other star found are rejected.
<p>
 
  Up to 200 stars can be found. If there are more then they are
  ignored. There is the possibility that this may result in less than
  200 stars, as some of them may be close to others, and will thus
  be ignored.
<p>
 
 
<hr>
 <h2> 3 <a name="use"> Use </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The program starts off by asking you what type of measuring
  do you want to do:-
<p>
 
<ul>
<li>    Measure one or a number of images with the same parameters
<li>    Use the Gaussian centering after the centroid finding
<li>    Make an output results file
<li>    Calculate the zenith distance of the image
<li>    Use the image filter to determine the extinction correction
        (needs SecZ calculation)
<li>    Use a standard position and magnitude file to calculate the
        difference from the standard magnitude (needs SecZ and filter
        calculation)
</ul>
 
  It then asks you for a number of parameters associated with the
  the star finding and measuring process.
<p>
 
  Then there are a number of sections of parameter questions that are
  asked depending on which of the measuring options you have chosen
<p>
 
<ul>
<li> Output file
<li> Zenith distance (Star position in RA and Dec and site latitude)
<li> Use of filters for extinction calculations
<li> Use of standard file for standard magnitude calculations
</ul>
 
  Then the name of the input image file is asked for, and then the user
  is given the chance to correct the exposure time.
<p>
 
  The program then does the calculations and outputs the results to
  the terminal and (optionally) the file.
<p>
 
  If the user is doing more than one image, the program loops back
  to ask for the new image file name ( and the new corrected exposure
  time), and does the new calculations. This loop is repeated until
  a blank is input as the file name.
<p>
 
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4 <a name="input"> Input </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The input image is the standard Starman image file. It can have the
  'BSCALE' and 'BZERO' pixel value scaling, and the bad pixel magic
  value 'INVAL'.
<p>
 
  The optional standards file is a Starman table of the
  positions and magnitudes of stars. It has to have:-
 
<ul>
<li> the standard Identifiers (star names)
<li> the Right Ascension of the star (in radians)
<li> the Declination of the star (in radians)
<li> the Equinox of the position (Julian epoch - e.g. 1990.234)
<li> at least one magnitude
</ul>
 
  The magnitudes of different colours must be as magnitudes, not colours.
  I.e., a star with V=16.00 and B-V of 1.00 would have two entries, one
  for V=16.00 and one for B=17.00.
<p>
 
  The columns containing the magnitudes must have descriptors telling
  what waveband is in each column. In the example above, for example, the
  V column could have a descriptor with 'V', and the B column one of 'B'.
<p>
 
  The column descriptors must be in the standard Starman table style, as
  HEADxxx, where xxx = 001, 002, etc. Thus in the example above the
  descriptors would be:-
 
<pre>
          name      content
          ----      -------
          HEAD001   RA
          HEAD002   DEC
          HEAD003   EQUINOX
          HEAD004   V
          HEAD005   B
</pre>
 
 
<hr>
 <h2> 5 <a name="output"> Output </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The output of the program is typed to the terminal, and can optionally
 be output to a text ASCII file (with a .DAT modifier). The file contains
 a copy of what is put out to the terminal, except that there is one line
 of header information at the start.
<p>
 
 The listing below gives an example of the output:-

<ul>
<li>  The 'Sk1', 'Sk2', etc., give the corrections that would have to be
      added to the mean magnitude, if the sky level in the associated
      sky aperture alone were to be used to estimate the sky level.
<li>  In this particular case, the 'File' position was selected to be
      used instead of the 'Image' position in calculating the SecZ.
<li>  The final magnitude has been calculated using the mean sky
      level from all four sky apertures, as they all lie with a
      user input tolerance (default +/- 10%) of the mean.
<li>  The exposure time put out is the image exposure time (perhaps
      changed by the user) plus the offset input by the user via the
      'EXPOFF' parameter. It is then time used in the calculations.
</ul>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 6 <a name="image_descriptors"> Image descriptors </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The image can contain much necessary ancillary information as
  descriptors. This is used by the program. Unfortunately there is
  no standard naming or format scheme. So the program is as flexible
  as possible on the input. The user can define the names of the
  descriptors carrying the relevant information.
<p>
 
  The user can even say where in some descriptor the information is.
  This is because sometimes information, such as the object name, does
  not take up the entire descriptor, but is placed within the descriptor.

 <h2> 7.1 <a name="avlim"> Avlim </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 0.1              Range 0.0 - 1.0e8)
<p>
 
  When averaging the flux estimates of the star when subtracting
  each of the (up to) four sky levels, how far away (in fractional terms
  - roughly magnitudes) can a measure be from the mean of the two nearest
  pair of estimates? If an estimate is more than 'avlim' times the mean
  flux, it is rejected and the mean recalculated. This stops if none are
  that far away of if only two estimates left.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7.2 <a name="box"> Box </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 100              Range - 1 to 10000)
<p>
 
  Side of box within which to search for a star's pixels.
<p>
 
  The search for contiguous pixels above the threshold level which
  denote a star is only done in a box of this size. This box is such
  that the first pixel found (in a search along X lines, goin up in
  the Y direction line-by-line), is centered in the box in the X
  direction, and at the bottom of the box in the Y direction.
<p>
 
  If the box is too large, the search takes too long. If it is too
  small (in relation to the star image size), then star pixels may be
  missed, skewing the location of the centroid.
<p>
 
  The default is probably a good compromise for 'normal' images. However
  for very out-of-focus images, the star 'size' may be larger than than
  100 pixels, so you should select a larger box.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7.3 <a name="date"> Date </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - '2001/01/01'       Range - see below)
<p>
 
  The date of the observation. This is asumed to be the same for all
  of the images to be used. It is input as Julian epoch number. The
  month must be in the range 01 to 12, and the day 01 to the end of
  the month input. The format must be as the default - 'YYYY/MM/DD'.
<p>
 
  This is used to precess the standards file positions to the date of
  the observation, so it does not need to be very precise.

  ( Default - 'DEC'        Choice - see below)
<p>
 
  The name of the descriptor in the image file where the Declination
  of the exposure may be found.
<p>
 
   'none' is valid entry. The Declination will then be got from the
   standards file, if this image has a star name and that name is in it.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7.5 <a name="docentre"> Docentre </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'No'             Choice - 'Yes/No')
<p>
 
  Should the position found by the program be refined by fitting
  a Gaussian to the location?
<p>
 
  The position found by the program is a centroid of the contiguous
  pixels above the threshold level above the overall image sky level.
  (For details on this see the 'Method - Star Location' help section.)
<p>
 
  If the star images are reasonably in focus, then it is possible
  to refine this position by fitting a Gaussian with a variable
  profile at that location.
<p>
 
  This gives a more accurate centering, but has the risk that the
  star image may be so strange as to cause the Gaussian fitting
  subroutine to fail catastrophically.
<p>
 
  Also if the stars are not in focus, then the fit may well fail
  or give the wrong position.

<p>
 
  The gain of the numbers in the image.
<p>
 
  This is the number of independent, Poissonian, events per pixel

  Thus after processing, an image pixel values will not be an exact
  value of the input. So the calculations of the errors, which assume
  on the pixel values being Poissonian noise woulf be wrong.
<p>
 
  This is the std. dev. the program should expect for a pixel value of
  zero. Thus if a 'bias level' has been subtracted, this could be the
  'bias noise' value.

  Comments:-<p>
 
<ul>
<li>  The 'Sk1', 'Sk2', etc., give the corrections that would have to be
      added to the mean magnitude, if the sky level in the associated
      sky aperture alone were to be used to estimate the sky level.
<li>  In this particular case, the 'File' position was selected to be
      used instead of the 'Image' position in calculating the SecZ.
<li>  The final magnitude has been calculated using the mean sky
      level from all four sky apertures, as they all lie within a user
      input tolerance (usually +/- 10%) of the mean.
<li>  The exposure time put out is the image exposure time (perhaps
      changed by the user) plus the offset input by the user via the
      'EXPOFF' parameter. It is then time used in the calculations.
</ul>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7.29 <a name="posntype"> Posntype </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'degrees'          Choice - 'degrees/radians/string')
<p>
 
  The format that the RA and DEC entries have in the RA and DEC
  descriptors.
<p>
 
  The 'degrees' and 'radians' choices are obvious. For the string
  input:-
 
<ul>
<li>      the RA numbers must be in the HHxMMxSS.SS format
<li>      the DEC numbers must be in the SDDxMMxSS.SS format
</ul>
 
   Where 'x' must not be 0-9, '+', '-', or '.'.
   The decimal places are optional.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7.30 <a name="raname"> Raname </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'RA'        Choice - see below)
<p>
 
  The name of the descriptor in the image file where the Right Ascencion
  of the exposure may be found.
<p>
 
   'none' is valid entry. The RA will then be got from the standards
   file, if this image has a star name and that name is in it.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7.31 <a name="sidtloc"> Sidtloc </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 1,79              Range - 1 to 256)
<p>

 <h2> 7.32 <a name="sidtname"> Sidtname </h2> </a> <p>
 
  ( Default - 'STSTART'        Choice - see below)

  time of the exposure may be found.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7.33 <a name="skydia"> Skydia </h2> </a> <p>

  The diameter of all the sky apertures in pixels.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7.34 <a name="stardia"> Stardia </h2> </a> <p>

 <h2> 7.35 <a name="stdmast"> Stdmast </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'Yes'             Choice - 'Yes/No')
<p>
 
  If you are using the standard magnitudes file and there is
  RA and DEC information in the image descriptors, you have two
  ways of calculating the RA and DEC. In this case, do you want
  to use the standards file positions ('Yes'), or the image
  descriptor positions ('No') ?
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7.36 <a name="stds"> Stds </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The name of the file containing the input table of standard star
  positions and magnitudes.
<p>
 
  The file is a Starman table of the positions and magnitudes of stars.
<p>
 
  It has to have:-
 
<ul>
<li> the standard Identifiers (star names)
<li> the Right Ascension of the star (in radians)
<li> the Declination of the star (in radians)
<li> the Equinox of the position (Julian epoch - e.g. 1990.234)
<li> at least one magnitude
</ul>
 
  The magnitudes of different colours must be as magnitudes, not colours.
  I.e., a star with V=16.00 and B-V of 1.00 would have two entries, one
  for V=16.00 and one for B=17.00.
<p>
 
  The columns containing the magnitudes must have descriptors telling
  what waveband is in each column. In the example above, for example, the
  V column could have a descriptor with 'V', and the B column one of 'B'.
<p>
 
  The column descriptors must be in the standard Starman table style, as
  HEADxxx, where xxx = 001, 002, etc. Thus in the example above the
  descriptors would be:-<p>
 
<pre>
          HEAD001   RA
          HEAD002   DEC
          HEAD003   EQUINOX
          HEAD004   V
          HEAD005   B

  when a pixel which is above that value is considered to be part
  of a star.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7.38 <a name="time"> Time </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - image exposure time           Range - 0.0 to 1.0e8)
<p>
 
  A chance to correct the exposure time read off the image.
<p>
 
  The actual time used in the calculations is this time plus the `exposure
  time offset', input via the `EXPOFF' parameter.
