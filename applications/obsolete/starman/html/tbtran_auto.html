<h1> TBTRAN_AUTO - <br>
 Transform one XY table to another
automatically
</h1>
<hr>
 
 
<p>
 
   This takes a table with X,Y positions and makes a new one with identical
   entries, but with the positions transformed onto the same coordinate
   system as another XY table.
<p>
 
   There have to be common stars in the two tables but they do not have to
   be matched, or aligned, or complete. The two coordinate systems must be
   related by (shift:rotation:magnification). Thus `shapes' in the two
   coordinate systems must be  similar. The program will fail if there is
   a shear, or a different scaling in and X and Y, or a distortion.
<p>
 
   It helps the program considerably if there are heights or magnitudes
   of the stars available. This is looked for in column three. If there
   is a header with `height' or 'mag', then this column is taken to
   have those values. If there is no such header, the user is asked
   if they are. If there is no column 3, or it does not contain heights
   or magnitudes, then the stars are analysed as though there are
   ordered by height, with the `brightest' first.
<p>
 
   The entries in columns 1 and 2 are taken as `X', `Y'. The output table
   then has values `X&#95 1', `Y&#95 1' with:-
<p>
     X&#95 1 =  c&#95 x(1) + c&#95 x(2)*X  + c&#95 x(3)*Y
<p>
     Y&#95 1 =  c&#95 y(1) + c&#95 y(2)*X  + c&#95 y(3)*Y
<p>
 
  With the `X coefficents', c&#95 x(1), c&#95 x(2), c&#95 x(3) and the
  `Y coefficents', c&#95 y(1), c&#95 y(2), c&#95 y(3), are calculated by
  the program.

 <h2> 1 <a name="method"> Method </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The program works out the triangle between the three
  brightest stars in each list. It then looks at the two
  triangles, and sees if they are the same by comparing
  the ratios in each triangle of the length of longest
  side to the length of next longest, and to the length
  of the shortest side. If the ratios are the same within
  a chosen tolerance, then the triangle probably must have
  been made with the same stars.
<p>
 
  If the triangles do not match, then this is repeated
  with the four brightest in each list. The program works
  out all the possible triangles between the stars in each
  list. It then looks at each triangle in one list, and
  sees if there is a matching triangle in the other list.
  If there is no match, this is then repeated with the five
  brightest stars, and so on, until a match is made.
<p>
 
  The precision of the matching needed, and the number of
  matched triangles needed to confirm the right matching has
  been done is at the users choice.
<p>
 
  After enough triangles have been matched, and for each of these
  matched triangles they are enough like it, and enough such
  well matched triangles have been found, the stars in these
  triangles are assumed to be the same in the two lists.
<p>
 
  Then the transformation equation between them is calculated.
<p>
 
  The transform can either be the (shift:rotation:magnification)
  transform described above or a simple XY shift without rotation,
  magnification or squeezing.
<p>
 
  The first ('input') list is then transformed into the
  coordinate system of the second ('master') list, using this
  transformation equation.
<p>
 
 Column three of the Input and Master tables are assummed to have either
 the heights or magnitudes of the stars in the tables. These are then
 used so that the program searches amongst the bright stars first for
 triangle matches. If there is no column three for a table, then the
 stars are taken in the order they are in in the table.

 <h2> 2.1 <a name="ftol"> Ftol </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 5.0 or 2.0      <br> Range - 0.0 to 1.0e7)
<p>
 
  The X or Y distance that a position calculated from the transform
  made for one matched triangle may be off from the position calculated
  from another matched triangle, and the two triangles still
  considered to be on the same coordinate system.
<p>
 
  The positions are calculated at the four corners of the system of
  stars that are in the matched triangles. Actually a bit outside the
  corners.
<p>
 
  This should be set as small as you think reasonable. If too small
  the program will reject real triangle matches. If too large,
  it will accept false triangle matches.
<p>
 
  The default error allowed is set at 2.0, for a simple XY shift, and
  at 5.0 for the more flexible full transform.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.2 <a name="in"> In </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - null)
<p>
 
  The file containing the input table, to be transformed.
<p>
 
  The first two columns must be X,Y. It helps if there is a third
  column with either height or magnitude.
<p>
 
  The table must be a standard Starman table format file. It
  is a Starman ADAM .SDF image, with `real' 32-bit real values,
  with each column having a header of up to 20 characters, and
  each row having a name of up to 20 characters.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.3 <a name="in_mags"> In&#95 mags </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'heights'             <br> Choice - 'heights:mags:none')
<p>
 
 Are the values in column three of the Input table magnitudes or
 heights? [If this is described in the table header for this
 column, this question is not asked.]
<p>
 
 Column three is used so that the program searches amongst the
 bright stars first for matches. If there is no column three, or the
 answer to this is `none', then the stars are taken in the order
 they are in in the table.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.4 <a name="ms_mags"> Ms&#95 mags </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'heights'              <br> Choice - 'heights:mags:none')
<p>
 
 Are the values in column three of the Master table magnitudes or
 heights? [If this is described in the table header for this
 column, this question is not asked.]
<p>
 
 Column three is used so that the program searches amongst the
 bright stars first for matches. If there is no column three, or the
 reply `none' is given, then the stars are taken in the order they are
 in in the table.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.5 <a name="master"> Master </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - null)
<p>
 
  The file containing the master table, to whose coordinate
  system the `input' table will be transformed.
<p>
 
  The first two columns must be X,Y. It helps if there is a third
  column with either height or magnitude.
<p>
 
  The table must be a standard Starman table format file. It
  is a Starman ADAM .SDF image, with `real' 32-bit real values,
  with each column having a header of up to 20 characters, and
  each row having a name of up to 20 characters.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.6 <a name="ntri"> Ntri </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 4      <br> Range - 1 to 10000)
<p>
 
  For each matched triangle, this is the number of other matched
  triangles that must be like it, for the matched triangle to count
  as a 'good' matched triangle.
<p>
 
  If made larger, the program will do a better job of rejecting
  false triangles, but will take longer.
<p>
 
  If the program finds matches from only a small number of triangles,
  it automatically relaxes this criteria.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.7 <a name="out"> Out </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - null)
<p>
 
  The file containing the output table.
<p>
 
  The table will be a standard Starman table format file. It
  is a Starman ADAM .SDF image, with `real' 32-bit real values,
  with each column having a header of up to 20 characters, and
  each row having a name of up to 20 characters.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.8 <a name="title"> Title </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - Input table title or `Output from TBTRAN&#95 AUTO'
   Choice - any)
<p>
 
  The Title to be added to the output file.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.9 <a name="tol"> Tol </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 1.0      <br> Range - 0.0 to 1.0e7)
<p>
 
  The X or Y distance a vertex of one triangle may be off from
  the system of another matched triangle, and the two triangles
  still be recognised as a match.
<p>
 
  This should be set as small as you think reasonable. If too small
  the program will reject real triangle matches. If too large,
  it will accept false triangle matches.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.10 <a name="totntri"> Totntri </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 8      <br> Range - 1 to 10000)
<p>
 
  This is the number of 'good' matched triangles that must be found
  for a fit to be considered sound and the calculations stopped.
<p>
 
  [The definition of 'good' is given in the help for the NTRI
   parameter.]
<p>
 
  If made larger, the program will do a better job of rejecting
  false triangles, but will take longer.
<p>
 
  If the program finds matches from only a small number of triangles,
  it automatically relaxes this criteria.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.11 <a name="type"> Type </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 'full'                  <br> Choice - 'full:xyshift')
<p>
 
 Should the transformation equation determined be a full one
 (xy shift, rotation, magnification), or just an xy shift?
<p>
 
 The fit cannot be one that changes the shape of objects.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.12 <a name="xcoeff"> Xcoeff </h2> </a> <p>
