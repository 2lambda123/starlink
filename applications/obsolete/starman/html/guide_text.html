<strong> General:- </strong><p>

 Starman is a stellar photometry package designed for the reduction 
 of data from imaging systems. Its main components are:- crowded-field 
 photometry programs; aperture photometry programs; a star finding 
 program; a CCD reduction program.
<p>

 Image and table handling are served by a large number of programs 
 which have a general use in photometry and other types of work.
<p>

 The package is a coherent whole, for use in the entire process of 
 stellar photometry from raw images to the final standard-system 
 magnitudes and their plotting as colour-magnitude and colour-colour 
 diagrams. 
<p>

<strong> Stellar Photometry Programs:- </strong><p>
 
</ul> 
<li>  Converter of raw CCD images to calibrated ones. 
<li>`Dust-ring' flat-field dealer. 
<li>  Star position finder. 
<li>  Stellar profile determiner. 
<li>  Crowded-field, and also simple, stellar photometry measurers. 
<li> Averager of photometry estimates from different images. 
<li>  Colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagram plotters.  
<li>  Adder of `fake' stars to an image. 
<li>  Automatic aperture photometry for all bright well isolated stars. 
</ul><p>  

<strong>  Image Handling Programs:- </strong><p>

<ul>
<li>  Image display for Xwindow devices. 
<li>  Interactive image display for Xwindow devices.
      This includes:- 
      <ul> 
      <li> <i> Inspection: </i>
           zoom/pan, pixel value, `slice', colour LUT, 
           solid-body plots, plotting of positions on image, 
           interaction with the output of the crowded-field stellar 
           photometry measurer. etc;
      <li> <i> Measurement: </i> 
           interactive aperture photometry, interactive 
           position file making, etc.;
      <li> <i> Manipulation: </i> 
           maths, rotation, cutting, smoothing, unsharp masking, weeding,
           pixel setting, etc.;
      <li> <i> `GUI'-like interaction: </strong> 
           when dealing with some of the image and graphical display;
      </ul> 
<li>  Extensive general programs: Maths, joining, cutting, reading, etc.. 
</ul><p>

<strong> Table Handling Programs:- </strong><p>
 
<ul>
<li>  Spread-sheet, Calculator. 
<li>  Input, Output, Listing. 
<li>  Graphical Plot, Star Chart. 
<li>  Joining. 
<li>  Extensive general programs: sort, weed, statistics, 
      matching, position transforming, etc.. 
</ul>

 `Starman' is not an acronym, and so should only have the first letter of
 its name in capitals.
