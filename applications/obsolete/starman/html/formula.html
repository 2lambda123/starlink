<h1> Starman PSF Formula </h1>
<HR>

This is a description of the profile used in <i> Starman </i>
PSF fitting.<p>

The profile is a rotated elliptical Lorentzian, with a low wide circular
modified Gaussian and an empirical correction map. The Gaussian wing and/or
the empirical map are sometimes not used. In many applications, the
profile sits on a plane sloping background.<p>

<pre>
 I(x,y)   = the value of the star profile at pixel position x,y 

 H        = the star peak Lorentz height (Gaussian and map are 
            an added fraction) 

 x0, y0   = the star centre position 

 A, B, C  = the sloping background

<strong> The Lorentz profile:</strong><p>

Rmaj and Rmin are the major and minor axes of the ellipse
which is rotated at theta  degrees to the X axis. (Rmaj and Rmin
are often referred to in the code as RX and RY.)<p>

RPmaj and RPmin are the radii along the major and minor axes
that the `power' of the profile is halved. (RPmaj and RPmin
are often referred to in the code as PRX and PRY.) <p>


P is often about 2.2; the RPs are usually about 6*(the Rs) <p>

<strong>The circular modified Gaussian profile: </strong><p>

<img src="formula_3.gif"> <p>

RQ is the radius, and PQ is the power of the modified Gaussian. HQ is
 the fraction of the main Lorentz profile peak that the Gaussian has. (HQ,
RQ and PQ are often referred to in the code as QH, QR and QR.)<p>


HQ is often zero, and is always small, of the order of 0.01; RQ is usually
greater than 5*(the Rs); PQ is often about 2.<p>
    

<strong> The empirical map: </strong><p>


F  is an empirical function, the 'Profile Map'. This is expressed in
terms of a fraction of the main Lorentz profile. The map is
sampled on a grid which can be finer than the pixel
grid. The grid has a spacing of int((1 + 2.9/min(Rmaj,Rmin)))
times finer than the pixel grid. Thus the empirical
function is sampled at spacings better than the Nyquist frequency.
Unless the star is distorted, the values in this map are zero, and
even if the star is distorted, they are usually very
small, with peak values less than 1 percent of the
main profile. The map is not an empirical representation of the image
residuals from the analytical profile, but of those residuals averaged
over the pixels. Thus depending on the pixel size relative to the star
radius, the map values will change, unlike the analytical profile
parameters.<p>

In profiles where the radius is less than 3 pixels, full account
is taken of the pixel undersampling in the analytical part and (where used)
in the empirical part.<p>
