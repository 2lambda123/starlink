<h1> TBSHEET - <br>
 Spreadsheet operations on a table
</h1>
<hr>
  
  
<p>
  
 TBSHEET is a spread-sheet program for the Starman tables.
<p>
  
 An input table (or part of it) is displayed as a grid on your graphics
 screen. You may perform various inspections, changes, and
 manipulations on the table. Part of these are the ability to add up to
 200 columns and up to 2000 rows to the table. The resultant table may
 be output to file.
<p>
  
 The format of the displayed screen is to some extent under the control
 of the user.
<p>
  
 The input table may be omitted. In this case a table of a size defined
 by the user, containing zeroes is set up for starting with.
<p>
  
 The display of the spread sheet uses the 'PGPLOT' graphics
 sub-routines, so you will need a terminal capable of graphics display,
 capable of writing 'black' areas, for which a PGPLOT driver exists.

  The user starts the programs, inputs the input file name (or null),
  and inputs the display type and whether it is monochrome or not.
  The programs then puts up the table on the screen.
<p>
  
  The user then chooses to replace a value or row name or column
  header by clicking on them, or chooses one of the options. The option
  choice is done by placing the cursor on an 'option' box and pressing
  any key on the keyboard, or maybe cursor button. Then the program
  performs that option (which may involve further user input either
  from the cursor or from the keyboard - the 'prompt' message will
  indicate this).
<p>
  
  This process is then repeated, until the user chooses to exit.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 2 <a name="menu"> Menu </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
 Numbers in the table are changed by clicking on them, and then
 using the keyboard to replace the values. The same goes for the
 row names and the column headers. For the other options, place
 the cursor on the desired option in the menu panel displayed above
 the table, and press a key on the keyboard or maybe use the
 cursor button.
<p>
  
 Menu of options available:-

 Name          Function
 ----          --------
 Add Cols      Add columns to the table. A column (or columns)
                is added to the data, located after the
                column picked by the cursor. (See below for
                data entry.)
 Add Rows      Add rows to the table. A row (or rows)
                is added to the data, located after the
                row picked by the cursor. (See below for
                data entry.)

                replaced by the histogram. When you wish
                to return to the sheet, just answer question.
 Input         Load a new table
 Insert        Insert data into table. Select a range of rows
                of columns by the cursor (t.l.h and b.r.h
                corners). Keyboard enter data one at a time.
 Insert Cols   Add columns to the table. A column (or columns)
                is added to the data, located before the
                column picked by the cursor. (See below for
                data entry.)
 Insert Rows   Add rows to the table. A row (or rows)
                is added to the data, located before the
                row picked by the cursor. )See below for
                data entry.)

                by the number of columns displayed.
 Plot          One column can be plotted against another, both
                picked by cursor. Double click gives column
                choice by keyboard. The sheet is then
                replaced by the plot. When you wish
                to return to the sheet, just answer question.
 Position      Change the column/row shown at the top left
                of the display to that demanded.

    Click on (row,column)  position, and enter a value by the keyboard.
  
<p><dt> <strong>  2) </strong> <dd>
    Click on the 'insert' option, choose an area of the table
    to enter the data into, and then use the keyboard. <p>

    Use the cursor to set top left hand row and column corner of
    the set and then again to specify the bottom right hand corner. <p>

    Then through the keyboard enter values, one at a time. The data are
    entered from the top down. <p>

    To stop, enter - !! - <p>
   
  
<p><dt> <strong> 3) </strong> <dd>
    Click one of the four the 'insert cols/rows' or 'add rows/cols' options.<p>

<dl>
<p><dt> <strong> Row Data Entry </strong> <dd>

     Entering data for a row is done by typing in values for
     the entries in the row, separated by commas. If you do not
     enter all the values, the rest are given the value of zero.
     If you enter all the row values, you may add the name. The
     name must have no spaces (you may wish to use _ for a space)
     If you do not input a name, the row is given the name #n
     where n is the number of the row. You are then asked for the
     values for the next row to be entered. A completely null
     response ends the inputting of data. <p>
    
<p><dt> <strong> Column Data Entry </strong> <dd>

     Entering data for columns is done by typing in values for
     the entries in the first row of each column, separated by
     commas. The number of entries you put in will be taken as
     the number of columns to put into the table. All the rows
     in each column are then given the value of that in the their
     first row. The column header is set as a blank space. <p>
    

</dl><p>
  
<p><dt> <strong> 4) </strong> <dd>
    Row names and columns headers can be input by clicking on them, and

 <h2> 4 <a name="calculations"> Calculations </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
 There is an option when using this program to perform arithmetic
 and mathematical functions to be applied to the values of column(s) in
 the table ( and to, optionally, a number of input tables) and
 constants by means of a FORTRAN-like expression which specifies the
 required functions. The results are then loaded into the desired
 column of the working table.
<p>
  
 In addition to the standard FORTRAN facilities, a number of special
 functions are available (e.g. for adding noise).
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 4.1 <a name="method"> Method </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
<strong>  General </strong>
<p>
  
 The user inputs a Fortran-like equation (through the parameter
 EQUATION).
 These equations can contain references to:-
<p>
<ul>
<li> specified columns of specified tables (which must all have the
     same number of rows, but mayhave different numbers of columns)
     The table presently in the spread-sheet can be refered to.
<p><li> variables
<p><li> constants
<p><li> Fortran operators on these (e.g. '+', or 'cos()', ... )
</ul><p>
  
 (For more details on the structure of these equations ) see below.
<p>
  
 The equation is then analysed and the operations are performed.
 Each row of the output column column contains the results of the
 equation, with the data for the input tables coming from the matching
 row of those input tables.
<p>
  
 More specifically, the equation is analysed to identify the names
 of tables and variables and to evaluate constants and are then
 converted into reverse-Polish notation. The tables and variables are
 prompted for in alphabetical order and the program then performs
 simple 'stack-arithmetic' to evaluate the expression for each output
 table element.
<p>
  
 <strong> The Equation </strong>
<p>
  
 An arithmetic expression of up to 80 characters which gives the
 function to be evaluated for each output table element. The syntax
 is similar to Fortran (same operator precedence, etc.) but with the
 following differences:
<p>
<dl>
<p><dt> <strong> a) </strong> <dd>
    Input tables are represented by any of the variables TBn1, TCn2,...
    to TZnm, where the 'B', 'C', etc., refer to the table and the 'n1',
    'n2', .. etc., refer the column number in that table to use.
  
<p><dt> <strong> b) </strong> <dd>
    The table presently displayed in the spread sheet is refered to
    as 'TA'. The column numbers are refered to as normal.
  
<p><dt> <strong> b) </strong> <dd>
    Numerical parameters by any of the variables variables A to Z
  
<p><dt> <strong> c) </strong> <dd>
    Constants by any numerical Fortran constant (real or integer,
    including exponent if required).
  
<p><dt> <strong> d) </strong> <dd>
    Arithmetic is performed as though all values were real, The actual
    calculations are performed in double precision, and the results
    translated back to reals.
  
<p><dt> <strong> e) </strong> <dd>
    The standard Fortran functions are available and identified
    by their generic names, i.e. SQRT, EXP, LOG10, LOG, SIN, COS, TAN,
    ASIN, ACOS, ATAN, ATAN2, SINH, COSH, TANH, ABS, AINT, ANINT, MOD,
    SIGN, DIM, MIN & MAX. Note, however, that MIN and MAX may take only
    2 arguments.
  
<p><dt> <strong> f) </strong> <dd>
    To avoid problems with the way the Starlink environment
    handles character parameters:-
<ol>
<p><li>  The comma ',' must be replaced with the colon ':',
         for separating function arguments.
  
<p><li>  The division sign '/' may be replaced by the percent sign '%',
         although this latter substitution is not necessary when
         replying to a prompt at the terminal.
</ul><p>
  
<p><dt> <strong> g) </strong> <dd>
  
<p><dl>
<dt><strong> CLIP(A,B,C)  </strong>
<dd>                    This gives the value B so long as it lies in
                     the interval A to C (inclusive). Otherwise it
                     gives a zero result. It may be used to remove
                     output values outside a certain range (e.g.
                     if a division operation has resulted in very
                     large output values).
  
<p><dt><strong> GAUSS(X)     </strong>
<dd>                     Gives gaussian noise with zero mean and
                     standard deviation X (the value returned is
                     different at each element and for each call
                     of GAUSS).
  
<p><dt><strong> RAN(X)     </strong>
<dd>                     Gives uniform noise with a value between zero
                     and X (the value returned is different at each
                     element and for each call of RAN).
</dl>
  
</dl><p>
  
  For example, an equation of the form:-
<p>
  
        TA2*3.3 + 0.5 + COS(TB1) + A + MOD(RR:10.0) + CC%3
  
<p>
  
  will fill each row of a specified output column with:-
<p>
  
    ( 3.3 times the element in that row of column 2 of the presently
        displayed table ) <br>
  + ( 0.5 ) <br>
  + ( cosine of element in that row of column 1 of input table
        specified through parameter 'INB' ) <br>
  + ( the user defined value of the variable 'A' ) <br>
  + ( row number, modulo 10 ) <br>
  + ( (column number)/3 ) <br>
  
<p>
  
  <strong> Input </strong>
<p>
  
  Only tables and variables used in the expressions are prompted for and
  these are requested in alphabetical order, and only once each.
  The table refered to as 'TA' is the table presently in the spread
  sheet, and is thus not asked for.
<p>

 When the table is displayed, the screen shows the table itself
 and a number of other things.
<p>
  
 To the left of the table, there are the row numbers and the names
 attached to each row.
<p>
  
 Above the table, there are the column numbers and the headers attached

 <h2> 8.6 <a name="cols"> Cols </h2> </a> <p>
  (Default - 1,2          <br> Range - 1 to X size of table)
<p>
  
  The numbers of the two columns use.

 <h2> 8.7 <a name="command"> Command </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 'no'           <br> Choice - 'yes:no')
<p>
  
  This performs no operation. It merely gives the user a chance
  access the CL command line for help
<p>
  
  The user types '?' or '??', (without the 's) and gets access to
  help system. Then do 'return' to get back.
<p>
  
  '!!' will exit.

 <h2> 8.8 <a name="data"> Data </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - null        <br> Choice - any)
<p>
  
  A character string giving the data to input to a column or row.
  These are numbers (in the form (e.g.) 123 or -12.34 or -1.2e4),
  and maybe a name, separated by commas or spaces. There should
  be as many numbers as are needed to fill the column or row. If
  there are more, then the first numbers filling up the table
  are taken, and the next entry is taken as the column header or
  row name. If there are fewer, then the remaining numbers are
  filled up with zeroes. If there is no name at the end of the
  entry, then the column header/row name is taken as '#n' where
  n is the number of the column/row.
<p>
  
  The name must be no more than 20 characters long
<p>
  
  Numbers in a bad form, (e.g. 12j34) are taken as 0.0.
<p>
  
  Thus for a table row entry for row number five, where there are
  three columns, the character strings below would give the following
  input:-
<p>

 <h2> 8.11 <a name="equation"> Equation </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - null                  <br> Choice - as defined below)
<p>
  
  The FORTRAN-style expression that gives the elements to be loaded into the
  desired column in the working table.
<p>
  
  [For a more deatiled help than that given here,  look in the
  `The Equation' part of the `calculations' help sections above.]
<p>
  
  An arithmetic expression of up to 80 characters which gives the
  function to be evaluated for each output table element. The syntax
  is similar to Fortran (same operator precedence, etc.) but with the
  following differences:
<p>
  
<dl>
<p><dt> <strong> a) </strong> <dd>
    Input tables are represented by any of the variables TAn1, TBn2, ...
    to TZnm, where the 'A', 'B' etc., refer to the table and the 'n1',
    'n2', .. etc., refer the column number in that table to use.
    The table presently in the spread sheet is refered to as 'TA'.
<p><dt> <strong> b) </strong> <dd>
    Numerical parameters by any of the variables variables A to Z
<p><dt> <strong> c) </strong> <dd>
    Constants by any numerical Fortran constant (real or integer,
    including exponent if required).
<p><dt> <strong> d) </strong> <dd>
    Arithmetic is performed as though all values were real, The actual
    calculations are performed in double precision, and the results
    translated back to reals.
<p><dt> <strong> e) </strong> <dd>
    The standard Fortran functions are available and identified
    by their generic names, i.e. SQRT, EXP, LOG10, LOG, SIN, COS, TAN,
    ASIN, ACOS, ATAN, ATAN2, SINH, COSH, TANH, ABS, AINT, ANINT, MOD,
    SIGN, DIM, MIN & MAX. Note, however, that MIN and MAX may take only
    2 arguments.
<p><dt> <strong> f) </strong> <dd>
    To avoid problems with the way the Starlink environment
    handles character parameters, the comma ',' must be replaced with
    the colon ':' for separating function arguments. Similarly, the
    division sign '/' may be replaced by the percent sign '%', although
    this latter substitution is not necessary when replying to a prompt
    at the terminal.
<p><dt> <strong> g) </strong> <dd>
   There are three extra funstions available:-
    CLIP(A,B,C)  This gives the value B so long as it lies in the
                 interval A to C (inclusive). Otherwise it gives a
                 zero result. It may be used to remove output values
                 outside a certain range (e.g. if a division operation
                 has resulted in very large output values).
    GAUSS(X)     Gives gaussian noise with zero mean and standard
                 deviation X (the value returned is different at each
                 element and for each call of GAUSS).
    RAN(X)       Gives uniform noise with a value between zero and X
                 (the value returned is different at each element and
                 for each call of RAN).
</dl><p>
  
  For example, an equation of the form:-
<p>
  
        TA2*3.3+0.5+COS(TB1)+A
<p>
  
  will fill each row of a specified output column with:-
<p>
  
    ( 3.3 times the element in that row of column 2 of the present
        table ) <br>
  + ( 0.5 ) <br>
  + ( cosine of the element in that row of column 1 of the input table
        specified through parameter 'INB' ) <br>
  + ( the user defined value of the variable 'A' ) <br>
<p>

 <h2> 8.12 <a name="gtype"> Gtype </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 'xwindows'            <br> Choice - any)
<p>
  
  A character string giving the local name for the graphics
  display type.
<p>
  
  'xwindows' will put it out on the screen of your X-window device,
  if you are using one.
<p>
  
  If 'ask' is input, then the program asks a very similar question,
  in a different way. A response here of '?' will bring up a listing
  of all the possible names of graphics devices which are supported
  on your machine, and you then input the appropriate name.
<p>

  The name of the file containing the input table, or that of a new
  input table.
<p>
  
  The table must be a standard Starman table format file. It
  is a Starman ADAM .SDF image, with `real' 32-bit real values,
  with each column having a header of up to 20 characters, and
  each row having a name of up to 20 characters.
<p>
  
  
<hr>
 <h2> 8.16 <a name="inb"> Inb </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - null)
<p>
  
 When using the `calculation' mode to input data, then tables
 can be accessed in the `EQUATION' parameter. This is the input
 file containing the table corresponding to a 'TB' specfication
 in the equation.
<p>
  
 This is not to be confused with the `main' input table specified
 via the `IN' parameter.
<p>
  
 There can be up to 25 other tables accessed through the `TA' and
 `TC' to `TZ' parameters in the equation.
<p>
  
 All input tables must come from different files. To input a table
 more than once in the equation - refer to it by only one parameter.
<p>
  
 [This help is used for the `INC' to `INZ' parameters, accessed
  through the `TC' to `TZ', too.]
<p>
  
  The table must be a standard Starman table format file. It
  is a Starman ADAM .SDF image, with `real' 32-bit real values,
  with each column having a header of up to 20 characters, and

<p>
  
  If the value of a table entry (in the specified column) in a row
  lies within this range of values, then the row will either be
  accepted or rejected. (The choice of accept/reject is made with
  the 'weedopt' parameter after this parameter.)

 <h2> 8.26 <a name="ok"> Ok </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 'no'         <br> Choice - 'yes:no')
<p>
  
  In choosing to exit from the program without having previously
  stored the table since the last change, you will loose all the
  changes made to the table since the start (or since you last
  stored the then current state of the table).
<p>
  
  If you want this, then answering 'yes' will result in the
  program finishing. If on the other hand you do want to store the
  current state of the table, then answer 'no' (the default) and you
  will get back to the option choice. You can then store the table
  and then exit.
