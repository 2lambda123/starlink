<h1> TBPMATCH - <br>
 Extract entries with matching positions in two tables
</h1>
<hr>
 
 
<p>
 
   Match XY Positions in Two Tables.
<p>
 
   This takes two tables and makes two new ones which are copies of
   the old ones, but only contain the rows which match in X,Y position
   (within an input tolerance).
<p>
 
   The new table entries are in the same order as order they occur in
   the 1st table, but of course there may be rows missing if a match
   fails for that row.
<p>
 
   If the second table has more than one star near enough to the position
   of the star in the 1st to qualify, then selection is done on the
   basis of the option chosen.
<p>
<pre>
 Option    Function
 ------    --------
 alldup    All such stars - each star as often as it appears
 allnodup  All such stars - each star only once
 largest   Only the star with the largest value in NUMCOL
 nearest   Only the nearest star
 smallest  Only the star with the smallest value in NUMCOL
</pre><p>
 
   The position of an entry is taken as X from the first column
   and Y from the second column in the table.

  with each column having a header of up to 20 characters, and
  each row having a name of up to 20 characters.
