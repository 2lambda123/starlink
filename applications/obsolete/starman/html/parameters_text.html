<strong>       Introduction </strong><p>

 Starman is a command-driven package.  Thus to run the program 
 `imcut', you  type `imcut'. Commands in their turn have parameters
 by which you can qualify their behaviour. Thus to tell the `imcut'
 program that you want the first 50 pixels in X cut out, you
 have to set the \verb|imcut| parameter `xrange' to `1,50'. The 
 values of parameters are obtained by the programs in one of 
 seven ways:-
<p>

<ol>
<li> By your responses to a prompt
<li> When you supply them on the command line when starting 
      the program 
<li> When there is a `\\' on the command line 
<li> From `hidden' values
<li> By using the `Advanced Interfacing' described elsewhere.
<li> By making a new .ifl `interface' file 
</ol>
<p>

 This is the ADAM parameter system which is described in the
 ADAM SUN4 document. For convenience, the main aspects of this
 parameter system as seen by a user of Starman are described below. 
<p>

 [Most of what follows is thus applicable to any ADAM application.] 
<p>


<strong>  Response to Prompts    </strong><p>

 When a program is running, and wants to know the value of the
 (say) `XXX' parameter, it will output a request in the format:-
<p>

<pre>
      XXX - prompt/ >
</pre><p>

  or
<p>
<pre>
      XXX - prompt/default/ >
</pre><p>

 You respond with the value that you want the parameter to have. If a single
 value is needed, just input that. If more than one value is needed, input
 them separated by commas. Character strings may have spaces. If you reply
 with a `carriage return', then the default value, if any is taken. There
 are rules on defaults, acceptable values, and on getting help.
<p>


<strong>      Command Line Setting </strong><p>

 Parameters may be assigned values on the command line. Thus to run IMCUT
 where you want the cut out first 50 pixels in X of the image, you could
 type:-
<p>

<pre>
  > imcut $STARMAN_DATA/imcut_in out=fred xrange=\[1,50\] 
          yrange=\[1,99\] bin=\
</pre><p>

 or
<p>

<pre>
  > imcut $STARMAN_DATA/imcut_in out=fred xrange=\[1,50\] \\
</pre><p>

 The first 50 pixels in X and the first 99 pixels in Y will be cut out with
 no binning. In the first example. you will only now need the on-line input 
 of the `TITLE' whilst running the program, 
<p>
 
 This example illustrates a number of facets of inputting parameter values on
 the command line. The rules about command line input are:- You have to put
 the parameter name and an equals sign before the parameter value. If you do
 not, then that parameter value is taken to refer to the parameter which is
 in the same position in the program `interface' file, the file which
 Starman uses to access parameters. Generally, the first two
 parameters in an interface file will be the `IN' and `OUT'  parameters, 
 but this is not an iron-clad rule. If the parameter name and `>' are 
 followed by a blank space, the default values are taken.
<p>


<strong>  `Hidden' Setting    </strong><p>

 Some programs have parameter values that you cannot normally get at. The
 program will automatically assign the default values to these parameters.
 These parameters are known as `hidden' parameters. 
<p>

 These defaulted parameters enable programs to have many options, say for
 controlling the appearance of some graphical output, without making routine
 operations tedious because of a large number of prompts. These defaulted
 values are described in the HELP for each program. 
<p>

 If you wish to change the values of these parameters, you may do so by
 inputting them on the command line.
<p>



<strong>      Advanced Screen Interface Setting </strong><p>

 For certain parameters in certain programs, one can use the flexible Advanced
 Screen Interface described elsewhere.
<p>

<strong>      Interface Files </strong><p>


 The Starman programs pick up information about the parameters from
 the `interface' file. Thus there is an interface file for (say) 
 the `imcut' program.
<p>

 This can be looked at:-
<p>

<pre>
 > ls $STARMAN_BIN/bin/imcut.ifl

                         (EXTRACT FROM)
 #   
 # IMCUT.IFL
 #
 interface IMCUT
    helplib   '$STARMAN_HELP_A IMCUT parameters'
    parameter IN
       type    NDF
       access  READ
       helpkey 'IN'
       ppath   'dynamic,default'
       default !
       position 1
       prompt 'Input image'
    endparameter
    parameter OUT
       type    NDF
       access  WRITE
       helpkey 'OUT'
       ppath   'dynamic,default'
       default !
       position 2
       prompt 'Output image'
    endparameter
    parameter XRANGE
       type    '_INTEGER'
       ppath   'dynamic'
       position 3
       helpkey 'XRANGE'
       prompt 'X range to cut out'
    endparameter
    parameter CHECK
       type    '_LOGICAL'
       ppath   'dynamic'
       position 7
       helpkey 'CHECK'
       prompt  'If any box pixel invalid, output invalid? (yes:no)'
    endparameter
    parameter TITLE
       type    'LITERAL'
       ppath   'dynamic'
       position 8
       helpkey 'TITLE'
       prompt  'Title to add to output image'
    endparameter
 endinterface
</pre><p>
 
 You can set you own `permanent' parameter values by making your own
 interface file. `cp' the file from the `starman' directory into the
 directory you are working in (as `NAME'.ifl), and alter the lines. Thus to
 set the XRANGE to `1,50', add into the XRANGE parameter part:-
<p>

<pre>
     VPATH 'default'
     DEFAULT '1,50'
</pre><p>

 Then every time you run IMCUT when you are in this directory,
 the XRANGE parameter will be `hidden' and set at this value. This
 will be true even if you exit from Starman and later re-enter. However
 this only works if your default directory is this directory where your
 new interface file is.
<p>


<strong>      Defaults </strong><p>

 When you are inputting parameters by responding to a prompt, you may be
 given a `default' value. Thus if you are using IMCUT, when you are asked
 for the range in X pixels to cut out, for an input image with 100 pixels in 
 X, you would get:-
<p>

<pre>
    XRANGE - prompt/[1,100]/ >
</pre><p>

 Thus the default values are to take the entire X range. There are three 
 types of responses you can make. You can:- input your own values to override
 the defaults (in this case `2,99' would override); input some of your
 own values. If there is more than one value to input, if you do not put
 all the values in, the remaining ones are set at the default (in this 
 example `2' would results in values of `2,100' being taken); you can
 just press `carriage return', when the defaults are taken.
<p>
 
 Help on the defaults is given in the normal help system.
<p>


<strong>      Acceptable Inputs </strong><p>

 For some parameters, there are checks on the input. Thus for the
 `imcut' xrange| parameters, any input of X pixel range which would fall
 outside the image would be refused.
<p>

 If an unacceptable value is input, a help on what is wrong is output,
 and then either the parameter is asked for again, or the program will
 take some other action.
<p>

 Help on acceptable values is given in the normal help system.
<p>


<strong>      Help on Parameters </strong><p>

 Help on the parameters of a program is available via the normal help
 for the program. Thus to get a list of all the parameters for the 
 program `imcut', type:-
<p>

<pre>
     > starmanhelp imcut param
</pre><p>

 You will then also be able to get the help on the individual 
 parameters.
<p>
 
 When you are actually running the program, respond with `?', and the
 help on the parameter will be given.
<p>


<strong>      Menus </strong><p>

 Some Starman parameters are menus from which you select an option.
 You do not have to enter the full option string, but merely a string 
 that selects a choice unambiguously.  In many cases this can be as
 little as a single character.  Here is an example from IMCUT:-
<p>

<pre>
     SAMPLE - prompt/'yes'/ >
</pre><p>

 The acceptable values you could input now are `yes' or `no'. But `y' 
 or `n' would also be acceptable.
