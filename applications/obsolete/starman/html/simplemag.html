<h1> SIMPLEMAG - Isolated stars photometry
</h1>
<hr>
 
 
<p>
 
  This program does three kinds of simple photometry. They are:-
<p>
 
   - Aperture photometry on isolated stars.
<p>
 
   - Simple Gaussian profile photometry on isolated stars.
<p>
 
   - Determination of mean Gaussian radii from isolated stars.
<p>
 
 The three kinds are executed by entirely different sections of
 the program. These sections can be thought of as separate
 programs, one of which is chosen after entering SIMPLEMAG.
<p>
 
 In all cases, an image and a list of star positions is input and
 the work done using those inputs.

 <h2> 1 <a name="aperture_photometry"> Aperture photometry </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 Does aperture photometry on stars in an image.
<p>
 
 For each star in the input table of positions, the program does:-
<p>
 
 1) Optionally, refine position before use by centering on the star
    that near the table position.
<p>
 
 2) Place an aperture of specified size at the position.
<p>
 
 3) Calculate flux in an aperture at the position.
<p>
 
 4) Calculate mean `sky' level with a circular annulus around the
    position, with specified inner and outer radii,
<p>
 
 5) Subtract sky level from the flux in the aperture.
<p>
 
 6) Calculate star magnitude as:-
<p>
<pre>
         Mag = 30 - 2.5*log  (star-(sky level)*area)
                           10
 
         where area = star aperture area
</pre><p>
 
 7) Store result in output table.
<p>
 
 8) Optionally, type out result to user.
<p>
 
 The error in the star magnitude and sky level are also calculated
 from the pixel values. The pixels are presumed to be Poisson noised,
 with a scale level put in by the user. This is a number such that
 if the pixel values are multiplied by this number, then the pixels
 would have proper Poisson noise. There is also a user input value
 for an extra noise level that is added to each pixel. This noise can
 be thought of as the noise that would be there if the pixel values
 had a mean level of zero.

 <h2> 1.1 <a name="aperture_output"> Aperture output </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The file output by this program uses the `OUT' parameter, and
 is a table of results. The contents of the table are the parameters
 measured for each star:-

  12   Sky Error    Error (std dev) in sky level
  13   Sky Number   Numb of valid pixels in sky annulus
  14   Sky Invalid  Numb of invalid pixels in sky annulus
 
  The magnitudes are calculated as:-
 
         Mag = 30 - 2.5*log  (star-(sky level)*area)
                           10
 
         where area = star aperture area
</pre><p>
 
 If the star flux is negative, the magnitude is set to 50. It is
 also set at that level if there are no good pixels in the star aperture
 and/or none in the sky annulus.

 <h2> 2 <a name="gaussian_photometry"> Gaussian photometry </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  Does photometry on isolated stars in an image, fitting a 2-D
  Gaussian to stars whose positions are given in an input list.
<p>
 
  It estimates the flux of stars in an image, by taking a small area
  around the star position and fitting a background and a 2-D Gaussian
  profile to the data in that area. The star positions are taken from
  an input table, and the results are (optionally) typed out and
  stored in an output table.
<p>
 
  The Gaussian profile is an ellipse, orthogonal to the X and Y
  axes.
<p>
 
  This program takes no account of sub-pixel variations. Thus a
  profile whose value changes significantly inside a pixel will
  be assumed to have the mean value as the value at the centre of
  that pixel. For narrow profiles, this will introduce errors.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 2.1 <a name="gaussian_method"> Gaussian method </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
   The star profile is of the form:-
<p><pre>
 
                    2
                -1.d
          I =  e
 
          Where d = sqrt((X/RX)**2+(Y/RY)**2)
</pre><p>
 
  Beware that, as stars are not exactly Gaussian, the fitted profile
  will vary with box size.
<p>
 
  This program takes no account of sub-pixel variations. Thus a
  profile whose value changes significantly inside a pixel will
  be assumed to have the mean value as the value at the centre of
  that pixel. For narrow profiles, this will introduce errors.
<p>
 
  Star profiles are not strictly Gaussian, so for stars with whose
  profiles differ, there will be a small, systematic, error in their
  relative magnitudes. That is the magnitude is not a `correct'
  estimate from the `volume' of a star. However for stars with the
  same profile, for example in many cases, stars in one image, this
  error has the same fractional size, and so the relative magnitudes
  are correct.
<p>
 
  For very faint stars, letting the profile radii vary can cause
  significant errors.

                      fitting (the maximum allowed is 20)

                      fit and the data, in an area around
                      the star centre

 11     Rx           The fitted X radius of the profile
 12     Ry           The fitted Y radius of the profile
 
 
  The magnitudes are calculated as:-
 
 
        Mag = 30.0 - 2.5.log  (pi.height.rx.ry)
                            10
 
 
  where (pi.height.rx.ry) is the `volume' of a Gaussian.

 <h2> 3 <a name="gaussian_radius"> Gaussian radius </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  Estimates the mean Gaussian Radii of stars in a table of
  star positionss in an uncrowded image.
<p>
 
  It makes three estimates, by using three methods:-
<p>
 
<ul>
<li> Fit each star individually and average the measured radii
<p>
 
<li> (Optional) Take the pixels round each star and add them
      together to make one star, and then measure its radii. The
      adding is done assuming that each star centre is at the b.l.h.
      corner of the pixel in which it actually falls.
<p>
 
<li> (Optional) Take the pixels round each star and add them
      together to make one star and then measure its radii. The
      adding is done by taking the star centres to be at their
      calculated positions and using an interpolation method to
      put the best pixel values into the summed star.
</ul><p>
 
  This program takes no account of sub-pixel variations. Thus a
  profile whose value changes significantly inside a pixel will
  be assumed to have the mean value as the value at the centre of
  that pixel. For narrow profiles, this will introduce errors.
<p>
 
  The profile is an ellipse, orthogonal to the X and Y axes.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 3.1 <a name="radius_method"> Radius method </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
   The position, radii, and height of each of the stars in the table
   are found by taking a small box round each star in the image, and
   fitting a single 2-D Gaussian (with different X and Y radii), but
   no rotation. No allowance is made for the fact that there may be
   contamination by nearby stars. The results may be typed out.
<p>
 
   Bad stars are then rejected, on the basis of 'invalid' pixels
   in the fitting boxes, radii too large or small, heights too small.
<p>
 
   The mean of the fits is then calculated and typed out.
<p>
 
   The program then makes a 'grand' star by taking the data around
   each individual good star centre and adding each pixel value into
   a total array at its appropriate position. The radii of this mean
   star are then calculated, typed, and stored as parameters of the
   program.
<p>
 
   An even better radii is then calculated by doing the summing in a
   better way, in which the program allows for the fact that the
   stars are not centred at integral pixel values by interpolating
   between pixels before adding into the mean array. The radii of
   this mean star are then calculated, typed, and stored as parameters
   of the program.
<p>
 
   The star profile is of the form:-
<p><pre>
 
                                     2
                                 -1.d
                           I =  e
 
               Where d = sqrt((X/RX)**2+(Y/RY)**2)
</pre><p>
 
    Beware that, as stars are not exactly Gaussian, the fitted profile
    will vary with box size.
<p>
 
  This program takes no account of sub-pixel variations. Thus a
  profile whose value changes significantly inside a pixel will
  be assumed to have the mean value as the value at the centre of
  that pixel. For narrow profiles, this will introduce errors.

<p>
 
  Either the program can determine the best values of the
  profile radii for each star, or it can keep those radii
  fixed throughout the program with user-determined values.
<p>
 
  If they are allowed to vary, then the starting values, of the

  No account is made of sub-pixel variations.
<p>
 
  The table contains three columns, the first the distance from
  the centre of the fitted star, the second the summed data values,
  and the third the value of the fit at that point.
<p>
 
  This is a table with the radial plot of the fit and the data
  after a fit has been to done to the array made by summing up all
  the areas round each star in the input table.
<p>
 
  If a null repsonse is made, this table is not made.
<p>
 
  This is a `real' 32-bit real Starman table format NDF file.

  (Default - null)
<p>
 
  The name of the table to contain radial profile fitted and a
  radial plot of the data of the data for the summed star, using
  interpolation. The fit and the data are folded around the centre of
  the fit.

 <h2> 4.25 <a name="radlims"> Radlims </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 0.5*fitted radius,1.5*fitted radius or 1.0,10.0
   Range - 0.1 to 100.0)
<p>
 
  The lower and upper limits to the range of acceptable radius
  (average of the X and Y radii) for a star.
<p>
 
  If an individual star has a fitted radius outside these limits,
  it will not be used in making the mean radius, nor will the box
  round it be used in making the grand summed star which is later
  fitted.

<hr>
 <h2> 4.27 <a name="rx2"> Rx2 </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Output parameter)
<p>
 
  The mean X radius, calculated from fitting to the summed data of

 <h2> 4.28 <a name="rx3"> Rx3 </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Output parameter)
<p>
 
  The mean X radius, calculated from fitting to the summed data of
