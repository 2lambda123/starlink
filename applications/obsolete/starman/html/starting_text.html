 Getting started with Starman. This describes some of the various
 parts of using Starman.
<p>

<strong> Quotas </strong><p>

 Simple programs in Starman run correctly with normal the normal quotas
 set for you by your Starlink node manager. 
<p>

<strong>    Setting Up Starman </strong><p>


 Setting up your system to be able to use Starman.
<p>
  
 On Starlink machines, when Starman has been set up by the system
 manager, just type 'starman'. You will need to have already set
 up the Starlink software with 'source /star/etc/login'.
<p>

 On other machines, find where the Starman programs are, and run the
 shell script 'starman', for example:-
<p>

<pre>
      'source /home/user1/ajp/snew1/starman' 
</pre><p>

<strong>    Running Starman</strong><p>


 To run Starman from the shell just enter the command
<p>

<pre>
     > starman
</pre><p>

 This executes a procedure which you stay in while executing Starman 
 commands. It also defines some logical names. You now can
 mix Starman commands with the familiar UNIX ones.
 While setting up the names, some information about the current version
 is given out.
<p>

 You can now run the Starman programs by just typing their names.
<p>
 
 So what do you get for your trouble?  There is a classified
 list of the programs available. These are explained in more detail
 elsewhere.
<p>

<strong>    Issuing Commands </strong><p>


 To run an application you then can just give its name---you will be
 prompted for any required parameters. Alternatively, you may enter
 parameter values on the command line specified by position or by
 keyword.  More on this elsewhere.
<p>

 Remember that UNIX is case sensitive, so keep the names in lower case.
<p>

<strong>    Answering Questions </strong><p>


  Answering questions on the keyboard
<p>

  When running a program, it will generally ask you a series of
  questions. These will come either as simple questions or
  as questions with default choices.
<p>

  An example of a simple question is (say), when the program
  wants the name of an input image. You will see appear on the
  screen something like:-
<p>

<pre>
      IN -  Input image file name? /!/ >
</pre><p>

  You should then type the name of file containing the image.
  If you just press `return', then the program will take this
  as the same as entering a `blank'. Such an input will have the
  effect that the particular stage of the program desires.
  Thus, for eaxmple, it may decide that you dont want any input
  image. Or it may decide that, to continue, it needs this name,
  and this case may either ask you again or it may just stop.
<p>
     
  An example of a question with a default, is when the program
  wants you to tell which of a list of options you want it do next.
  It may have some idea of what you likely reponse should be, or
  it may just guess (probably incorrectly). In this case, you
  will see something like:-
<p>

<pre>
      OPTION - Which action to perform? /'image/' >
</pre><p>

  In this case, again you would type in the name of the option
  you want it to perform. However it is suggesting (correctly or
  incorrectly) that you should want the `image' option. In this
  case, if you press `return', then it assumes that the this
  is the same as if you have typed `image', and will go and
  perform the image option. This suggestion is referred to as the
  `default' in the rest of the Starman help system.
<p>

<strong>    Obtaining Help </strong><p>


 The Starman help system may be entered either whilst you are not 
 running a program, or whilst you are running a program and 
 inputting a parameter value.
<p>

 When you are not actually running a program, then an introduction to 
 Starman can be obtained in hypertext with 
<p>

<pre>
     >starmanhyperhelp 
</pre><p>

 or in line mode with
<p>

<pre>
     > starmanhelp 
</pre><p>

 This puts you in the top level of the Starman help and you can 
 explore all the sub-topics. There is a sub-topic for each program 
 and then more general helps:-
<p>

<pre>
 Author   Information on the Starman author 
 Guide    A short run-through on using Starman 
 Help     More information on the HELP system
 Images   Information on Images 
 Menu     A list of programs with a one line description
 Starman  General information on the Starman package 
 Tables   Information on Tables 
</pre><p>

 When you are inside a program, the help system is available every time 
 you are asked by Starman for a parameter. Then by replying with a
 question mark, you get the help on that particular parameter.
<p>
 
<pre>
      IN -  Input image file name? /!/ > ?
</pre><p>

 If you want more general help on the program you are running, then
 respond to the parameter query with:-
<p>

<pre>
      IN -  Input image file name? /!/ > ??
</pre><p>

 which gets into the general Starman help.
<p>

<strong>    Upper and lower case </strong><p>


 Generally, Starman does not mind if your typed in input is
 in upper and/or lower case.
<p>

 Of course, in UNIX, file names are case sensitive, and so the
 directory names, such as $STARMAN&$95 DATA, also are case
 sensitive.
<p>

 However, some times you are asked for text input, for example
 the `title' to add to an image. The case of the characters is
 then preserved.
<p>

<strong>    Exiting a Program  </strong><p>


 If you are inside a Starman program and wish to stop running it, 
 then if you are putting in a parameter, just put in two 
 exclamation marks (!!). If the program is running by itself 
 either press the CTRLand C buttons or the CTRL  and Z  ones.
<p>

 If you have finished using Starman altogether, you need take no action,
 unless you are in ICL, in which case type
<p>

<pre>
     ICL> exit
</pre><p>

 which returns you to the shell.
