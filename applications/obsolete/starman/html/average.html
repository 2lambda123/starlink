<h1> AVERAGE - <br>
Average different photometry estimates <br>
(especially from MEASURE) </h1>
 
 This takes the output tables created by the stellar photometry
 program MEASURE (or any other program), and averages them to a table
 with weighted mean magnitudes. It also makes a text file with the
 details of the averaging.
<p>
 
 It can do this automatically, or the user can modify some of the
 rejection and averaging procedures.

<ol>
<li> Criteria for rejecting measures for intrinsic faults are input by
    the user. Then in the rest of the calculations star measures which
    violate these criteria are ignored.
 
<p><li> The program calculates, for each (excluding the first) input
    table, the mean difference in star magnitude of the measures in
    the table from those in the first input table. This gives the
    'zero-points' of the magnitudes in each table compared to the
    first table.
 
<p><li> Optionally, the user can refine the `zero-points'. The
    program plots out, for each input table, the scatter of these
    differences, relative to the 'zero-points'. The user can then put
    (via cursor and/or keyboard) in more accurate values for the
    'zero-points'.
 
<p><li> These mean differences are subtracted from the magnitudes in
    the tables, putting them all on the zero point of the first table.
 
<p><li> The rejection criteria for discarding magnitude estimates are set
    up. This is either done either interactively by setting discordance
    limits at each magnitude range, or automatically, by calculating
    these discordance limits or by using the input magnitude error
    estimates.
 
<p><li> Weighted means are made for each star of its magnitudes from the
    input tables. At this point discordant input magnitudes may be
    rejected.
 
<p><li> Some of the other parameters in the input tables (See the help
    on the input and output files to see which) are noted.
 
<p><li> The results are then put to the output file.
 
    A text file can also be made which gives some the details of the
    actual star by star averaging and measure rejection.
</ol>
 
 
<hr>
 <h2> 1.1 <a name="making_means"> Making means </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 A mean magnitude is made for a star by:-
<p>
 
<ol>
<li> Taking all the magnitudes from the input tables.
 
<p><li> Discarding those magnitudes where the fit parameters for the star in
   that particular input table suggest the measure is 'bad'. This
   method is here refered to as 'intrinsic' rejecting.
 
<p><li> Taking all the good measures and calculating a weighted mean. This
    is done in a complex way:-
<p><ol>
<li>  The weights are from the input error for the star in each table
      (subject to a switch `usesigma' and a minimum limit- see
       'sigmamin'). See the help below.
 
<p><li>  A rejection method is used for discarding measures which lie
      significantly away from the mean. This method is here refered to
      as 'means' rejecting. This may be done in one of three ways
 
</ol>
</ol>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 1.1.1 <a name="use_of_weights"> Use of weights </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The weights are from the input error for each star in each table.
<p>
 
 The weighting may be switched off and the unweighted means used (see
 `usesigma'). A minimum error may be set, so that any input error less
 than that minimum is set at that minimum (see `sigmamin').
<p>
 
 Whether to use weights or not, and if so, what value to give to
 `sigmamin' will depend on your estimate of the validity or otherwise,
 in each case, of the input error estimates.
<p>
 
 This method should only be used if the errors in the input magnitude
 files are good estimates. MEASURE caclculates this error but it is
 only correct if the correct noises and gains have been input to the
 MEASURE runs, and there were no other contributory sources of error.
 It is advisable to check on this, and you can do so by having a trial
 run with the `means&#95 rejecting' method, when the input errors are
 plotted against those found from the scatter between files.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 1.1.2 <a name="rejection_intrinsic"> Rejection intrinsic </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 A star magnitude estimate from a particular input file can be
 rejected by some of the other characteristics of the fit it was made
 in. These are:-
<p>
 
 - star centering in fit <br>
 - no of iterations taken in the fit <br>
 - chi-squared of the fit <br>
 - theoretical error estimate <br>
 - important companions <br>
 - invalid pixels in fit area <br>
<p>
 
 The extent to which these have to be 'good' is under the user's
 control.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 1.1.3 <a name="rejection_means"> Rejection means </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  The basic technique here is to look at the scatter of the
  magnitude estimates, for a star, from the input tables. Then
  estimates which diverge too much from the mean are rejected.
<p>
 
  There are three methods of 'means' rejecting, which are, in
  essence, two ways of defining what is meant by 'too much':-
<p>
 
<dl>
<dt>  (A) 'Default' method
 
<p><dd>      An estimate is only rejected if it lies more than 0.5mag
      from the mean.
 
<p><dt> (B) Scatter between the different estimates.
 
<p><dd>  For its magnitude, it differs from the mean by more than the
      level set for the user (or a default 0.5mag) for that magnitude
      value.
 
<p><dt>   (C) Theoretical expected error in each magnitude estimate.
 
<p><dd>  This method should only be used if the errors in the input
      magnitude files are good estimates. MEASURE caclculates this
      error but it is only correct if the correct noises and gains
      have beeb input to the MEASURE runs, and there were no other
      contributory sources of error. It is advisable to check on
      this, and to look at the check plot described below.
<p>
 
      Use the error estimate from MEASURE for a star for each file:-
<p>
 
<ol>
<li>   The weighted mean magnitude for this star from all the files
         (after the zero point corrections) is calculated.
<p><li>   The theoretical error in the mean (from taking all the input
         errors for this star from all the files) is calculated. This
         takes the input error estimates and does the proper
         calculation - akin to sqrt(sum[sigma.sigma]/((n-1)(n-2))) - to
         calculate what error in the mean magnitude should be expected
         from magnitudes having those errors.
<p><li>   This theoretical error expected for this star from this file
         is noted.
<p><li>   The difference of the magnitude for this star from this file
         from the mean is calculated.
<p><li>   The number of standard deviations (diff/theoretical error)
         from the mean that this difference represents is calculated,
         using the calculated errors in the mean and in this measure.
<p><li>   If this number of std. devs. is larger than a (user input -
         ERRMUL parameter) certain value, then that magnitude for that
         star from that file is rejected.
<p><li>   There is also a (user input - ERRLIM parameter) minimum value
         below which the `calculated error' cannot fall. This stops
         unrealistic error estimates causing false rejections.
</ol>
<p>
      If this method is adopted, then a plot is displayed of the `found
      error' (the difference of a single magnitude estimate from the
      mean magnitude) versus the `calculated error' (the expected
      value of this difference). The plot should show a linear
      relation with a slope of one. The `found errors' should scatter
      about the `calculated error'.
<p>
 
      If the plot looks OK, but the slope is not unity, then a
      conversion factor is needed to convert the input error estimates
      into true ones. Read this from the slope, and input it via the
      `ERRFAC' parameter.
<p>
 
      If the plot looks strange, then there is probably something
      strange about the input error estimates from MEASURE, and this
      method should be viewed with suspicion.
<p>
</dl>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 1.1.3.1 <a name="scatter_between_files"> Scatter between files </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 This sets at each magnitude (on the zero point of the first table) a
 maximum difference from the mean that is allowed, and then for each
 star to reject all measures that exceed that difference for the star.
<p>
 
 A histogram is calculated of the differences from the means of
 all the measures at each magnitude level.
<p>
 
 Then either an interactive selection of the rejection difference
 made, by plotting the histogram and the user selecting via a cursor
 the value, or automatically, by calculating the `width' of this
 histogram and using the user input multiplier of this width to
 select a value.
<p>
 
 The rejection is done star-by-star, with the most divergent star
 (weighted inversely by a magnitudes tolerance level - remember
 `Errlim') being rejected first. Then the mean is recalculated, and
 the process started again, with all previously rejected stars not
 used. This process continues until no more stars are rejected.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 1.1.3.2 <a name="theoretical_errors"> Theoretical errors </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 This, for each star and each table, looks at the input calculated
 theoretical error as given in the tables, and then to reject that
 measure if it is farther from the mean by some constant times that
 theoretical error. Thus one might want to reject all star measures
 more than three input theoretical standard deviations from the mean of
 all the measures.
<p>
 
 A problem is that the input theoretical errors may not be a good
 indicator of the actual errors. To help in evaluating this, the
 program, for each table, plots out the run of the theoretical error
 of a measure in a list of a star versus the error calculated from the
 scatter in the measures of that star in the all the tables. (This is
 actually done in bins of the theoretical error levels.) The user can
 then see if there is any systematic difference.
<p>
 
 If there is (say the difference errors are commonly twice the
 theoretical ones) then the rejection criteria can be adjusted (in
 this example by doubling the limit), if the user wants to believe the
 difference errors.
<p>
 
 There is also the option to accept up to a certain limit, even if
 the theoretical errors indicate a smaller limit. Thus for very
 well-exposed stars, a theoretical error limit of 0.002mag may be
 indicated, but the user might well feel that measures differing by
 0.01mag are realy ok.
<p>
 
 Thus after the plot is displayed, the user inputs via the keyboard the
 factor to multiply the theoretical errors to get the rejection limit,
 also the minimum rejection limit.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 1.1.3.3 <a name="which_is_better?"> Which is better? </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The scatter method is a good method when the input tables are all on
 roughly the same zero point, as it shows and uses the actual errors
 being encountered.
<p>
 
 However, if the tables have different zero points, then a measure from
 a long exposure will have a smaller error than one from a short one,
 and one would wish to use stricter criteria in rejecting it. Thus the
 theoretical method is better. The trouble with using the theoretical
 method is that the theoretical errors are not perfect indicators of
 the actual errors, and so should only be used (as described above)
 when the input errors are valid.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 1.2 <a name="star_names"> Star names </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 The files can either have the same stars in the same order (the
 default assumption), in which case there is a simple one-to-one
 correspondance between the stars in the input files and those in the
 output file.
<p>
 
 Or the star names in each file can be matched up. Then the output file
 has all the stars mentioned in all the input files. (Duplicate names
 in any file but the first are to be avoided.) The output file
 magnitudes are then means of those estimates in the input files that
 have estimates for those stars.
<p>
 
 The order of stars in the output file in this case, is:-
 
<p><ol>
<li> The order of stars in the 1st input file
<p><li> The order of any stars in the 2nd input file that were not in the
       1st file
<p><li> The order of any stars in the 3rd input file that were not in the
       1st file or the 2nd file
<p><li> etc
</ol>

 <h2> 2 <a name="automatic_use"> Automatic use </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
<dl>
<dt>  In automatic use:-
 
<p><dd>    The program runs through on the parameters input by the user at
    the start of the program.
 
<p><dt>  In interactive use:-
 
<p><dd>    The user interacts with the program, in addition to the input
    parameters. The interactions are through graphs:-
<p>
 
<ol>
<li>    to refine the `zero-point' differences between the files
           calculated by the program.
 
<p><li>    to select the rejection criteria (for each magnitude level)
           in using the scatter between estimates of a star, to
           reject estimates as being too far from the mean.
 
<p><li>    If the user selects using the errors calculated by
           MEASURE, then the program plots a graph using these
           errors and those calculated by the scatter between
           measures of each star. The user uses this to put in
           a correction factor to make the input errors proper.
          (As I have always felt doubtful of the MEASURE error
          calculations.)
</ol>
</dl>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 3 <a name="rejection_criteria"> Rejection criteria </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
 A star magnitude estimate from a particular input file can be
 rejected by some of the characteristics of the MEASURE fit it
 was made in. These are:-
<p>
 
<ol>
<li> Star found far from input position, in terms of the stellar radii.
<p><li> MEASURE took too many iterations to make the fit.
<p><li> Too many INVALID pixels in the area fitted when fitting.
<p><li> Chi squared value too high.
<p><li> Too many 'companions' to fit.
<p><li> The error calculated by MEASURE.
</ol>
 
 The extent to which these have to be 'good' is under the user's
 control.
<p>
 
 A further rejection for each star can be done by the scatter of
 the estimates from the input files. Any that are too far from the
 mean can be rejected.

  the input error estimates for a file to get 'true' estimates.
<p>
 
  You will already have used a graph to show the relationship

<p>
 
  Method to reject a magnitude for a star from a particular file
  because its value (after the file mean correction) differs too
  much from the mean of the measures from all the files (including
  the file itself).
<p>
 
  This defines the 'means' rejecting method.
<p>
 
  This is asked for repeatedly. At the start the 'default' of
  0.5 mag is set up. You can then set up any of the three ways.
  When you are happy, reply 'ok' to continue to the next step.
<p>
 
  This rejection can be done in one of three ways.
<p>
 
<dl>
<dt>   'Default'
<p><dd> If mag is more than 0.5 from the mean.
 
<p><dt>   'Mag'
<p><dd> For its magnitude, it differs from the mean by more than
              the level set for the user for that magnitude value.
<p>
 
              The tolerance levels are user input by the program
              calculating (at unit magnitude steps) histograms  of the
              scatter of magnitude estimates from the mean. The user
              then looks at these histograms and sets tolerance levels
              where the outliers are rejected.

              This method should only be used if the errors in the input
              magnitude files are good estimates. MEASURE caclculates
              this error but it is only correct if the correct noises
              and gains have beeb input to the MEASURE runs, and there
              were no other contributory sources of error. It is
              advisable to check on this, and to look at the check
              plot described below.
<p>
 
              Use the error estimate from MEASURE for a star for each
              file:-
<p>
<ol>
<li>           The weighted mean magnitude for this star from all
                  the files (after the zero point corrections) is
                  calculated.
<p><li>           The theoretical error in the mean (from taking all
                  the input errors for this star from all the files) is
                  calculated.
<p><li>           This theoretical error expected for this star from
                  this file is noted.
<p><li>           The difference of the magnitude for this star from
                  this file from the mean is calculated.
<p><li>           The number of standard deviations (diff/theoretical
                  error) from the mean that this difference represents
                  is calculated, using the calculated errors in the
                  mean and in this measure.
<p><li>           If this number of std. devs. is larger than a (user
                  input - ERRMUL parameter) certain value, then that
                  magnitude for that
                  star from that file is rejected.
<p><li>           There is also a (user input - ERRLIM parameter)
                  minimum value below which the `calculated error'
                  cannot fall. This stops unrealistic error estimates
                  causing false rejections.
</ol>
<p>
               If this method is adopted, then a plot is
               displayed of the `found error' (the difference of a
               single magnitude estimate from the mean magnitude)
               versus the `calculated error' (the expected value of
               this difference). The plot should show a linear
               relation with a slope of one. The `found errors' should
               scatter about the `calculated error'.
<p>
 
               If the plot looks OK, but the slope is not unity, then
               a conversion factor is needed to convert the input
               error estimates into true ones. Read this from the slope,
               and input it via the `ERRFAC' parameter.
<p>
 
               If the plot looks strange, then there is probably
               something strange about the input error estimates from
               MEASURE, and this method should be viewed with suspicion.

 <h2> 5.25 <a name="sigmamin"> Sigmamin </h2> </a> <p>
 
  (Default - 0.01          Range - 0.00001 to 100.0)
<p>
 
 The minimum `true' acceptable error value for a star. This is in
 (+/-)magnitude.
<p>
 
 If a star in an input table has an error less than this, the error is
 read in as though it were this minimum error.
<p>
 
 This is used as the errors are calculated as Poisson noise. This is,
 for bright stars, often less than the real errors, which have error
 sources such as flat-field errors, etc. Thus a bright star might have
 such a low error that the weighted averaging would place undue weight
 on that particular measure.
<p>
 
 Generally, if you are uncertain about whether the input error estimates
 are valid, then a high value of `sigmamin', say 0.05mag, is a good idea
 as this will weight all stars equally, except those that have a very
 high error estimate (in this case above 0.05mag).

<p><dd>    The user interacts with the program, in addition to the input
    parameters. The interactions are through graphs:-
<p>
 
<ol>
<li>    to refine the `zero-point' differences between the files
           calculated by the program.
 
<p><li>    to select the rejection criteria (for each magnitude level)
           in using the scatter between estimates of a star, to
           reject estimates as being too far from the mean.
 
<p><li>    If the user selects using the errors calculated by
           MEASURE, then the program plots a graph using these
           errors and those calculated by the scatter between
           measures of each star. The user uses this to put in
           a correction factor to make the input errors proper.
          (As I have always felt doubtful of the MEASURE error
          calculations.)
