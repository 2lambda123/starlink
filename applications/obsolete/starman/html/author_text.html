  This was all written by me, Alan Penny.
<p>

  With considerable help by Pat Morris, especially in the last
  four years, including with the conversion to Unix, and the
  making of a `stand-alone' Fits version
<p>

  Many people over the years have aided the development of this package,
  and their help is sincerely acknowledged.
<p>

  John Pilkington of RGO introduced me to 2-D Gaussian profile fitting
  for stellar photometry.
  Rakos of Vienna was the source of the basic Lorentz profile.
  Rodney Warren-Smith was the author of a table-handling system
  which was the starting point for the one used here.
  Gordon Robertson of the AAO helped me with extending the Lorentzian
  to 2-D.
  Bill Sparks of STScI suggested the base algorithm for Starfind.
  Kenneth Mighell of ESO was the inspiration for the base idea for one
  of the speed-ups done for in Measure and Profile.
  Peter Stetson of DAO was the inspiration for the base idea for Tbtran_auto.
