 As the use of Interact is interactive, there is an infinite number of ways
 of using it. However, to give you some ides of its use, the following
 `run-through' of one possible session is given. It is assumed you are at a
 colour X-window device.
<p>
  
 Where a '>' appears, you have to type the response, followed by a
 'return'. Where no response is shown, you just do the 'return'.
 The parts in curly brackets are instructions for actions by you, and
 not responses for you to type in. The parts in square brackets are
 comments on the display.

 Comments on above run-through:-
<p>
  
<ol>
<li>  By putting the target image file name on the command line, the
      first time the name is asked for, it will be got from this
      command line. (As the image parameter, (`IN'),is the first in
      the Interact interface file, we do not have to say `IN=name'.)
<p>
  
<li>  Interact has a `default' start. However, we avoid this to
      demonstrate usage of the program
<p>
  
<li>  We are now in the `main' group of options and have available all
      the functions of this group. The choice of the option of
      getting an image is suggested. By just doing `carriage return',
      we get that option. (As we have put the image file name on the
      command line, the name is not asked for again here.)
<p>
  
<li>  We are now asked again for what option we want, and are
      offered the default of displaying the image with standard display
      settings. We take that default.
<p>
  
<li>  What size of window is to be put up? The default is the size of
      the image. We choose a window twice as large. The program opens
      the window and displays the image at a contrast suitable for
      images which are `normal' pictures of astronomical objects. It
      types out the lower and upper pixel values that cover the range
      from pure black to pure white.
<p>
  
<li>  Again, what option? We choose the default, which is
      to switch over from keyboard entry of the desired options to
      `push-button' mode. A panel of push buttons and a separate help
      window appears. The help window contents change as the
      cursor moves over the buttons.
<p>
  
<li>  We now have the options available to use in the `main' group,
      via the buttons. We choose that which will let us look at the
      pixel values.
<p>
  
<li>  Note the change in display of cursor position and pixel values
      in the panel, as the cursor is moved over the image.
<p>
  
<li>  End this option and go back to the panel option selection.
<p>
  
<li>  Leave the `main' group of functions and go to the `inspect'
      group. See how the panel display changes.
<p>
  
<li>  Select the option to get a graphical slice through the image.
<p>
  
<li>  Choose the start of the `slice'. Note the cross marking your
      position, and the typing out of the location.
<p>
  
<li>  Choose the end of the `slice'. Note that the `slice' line is
      drawn and the end location typed out.
<p>
  
<li>  The program now asks you for the `Y' range of the graph
      to display trhe results. The default is +/- 10 percent
      larger than the actual range of pixel values in the slice.
      We take the default.
<p>
  
<li>  The program now has to display the slice. It does this
      using the Starlink graphics system, GKS. It asks for the
      name of the graphics device. We give it `xwindows', the
      graphics name of one the four possible graphical windows
      on our workstation. The program opens up the window.
<p>
  
<li>  Depending on how you have set up your X-wondow device,
      the background can be any colour. We thus need to choose
      whether to have black or white lines drawn. We select
      the default.
<p>
  
<li>  We are again able to choose an `inspect' option. We select
      the one to exit from the program.
<p>
  
<li>  The graphics system leaves the graphics window displayed.
      We could leave it there, ready for its next use. We choose
      however to delete it. (See the Starlink SUN on GWM for more
      about this.)

 <h2> 2 <a name="options"> Options </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  There are eight groups of options available. At the
  start of the program, one is in the base group, the `main'
  group. From here one can access the other seven groups,
  and also select from the simple set of options that all
  groups give access to.
<p>
  
  The eight groups are:-

<p>
  
  The `simple set' includes:- accessing the other groups and exiting;
  getting and displaying images; image zoom/pan, clearing;
  accessing pixel values; selecting image area.
<p>
  
  These groups can be accessed either by the keyboard, or by selecting
  the `panel' option, when a `panel' is shown on the image display,
  and the cursor can be used to push `buttons'. In this mode, a
  six-line help is displayed when the cursor is over a button.

 <h2> 2.3 <a name="aperture"> Aperture </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  There are two basic modes, both of which use a star aperture, moveable
  by the users with the mouse/cursor, one of which determines the sky
  value, to be subtracted from the star aperture counts, from the
  pixels in an annulus around the star aperture, and one which
  determines the sky from a seperate sky aperture (which must have
  previously been used to measure the sky).
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 2.3.1 <a name="aperture_general"> Aperture general </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  In both modes, repeated measurements can be done. For the
  `non-annulus' mode, when a sky level is determined, that level is
  used for all subsequent star measures, until a new sky level
  aperture location is chosen and a sky measure made.
<p>
  
   The result is calculated as:-
<p>
<pre>
  
   Output magnitude = 30.0 + `Zero point'
  
                       - 2.5*log  [(Star flux)/(Exposure time)]
                                10
  
   With
  
   Star flux = Flux in star aperture - (Sky level)*(Star ap area)
  
   Sky flux  = 1) (Flux in sky aperture)/(area of sky aperture)
       OR    = 2) Median pixel value in sky aperture
</pre><p>
  
   When making a star measure, the aperture can be centered on the star.
   The default method is to have no centering, but just to take the
   cursor position. A more accurate way is to fit a Gaussian to the
   star aperture data and centre on the centre of the Gaussian.
<p>
  
   There is an option, ('CENTRE'), which changes the method of
   centering on a star before measuring. By toggling through `CENTRE',
   you can choose one of the four ways:-
<p>
<pre>
  
    Option      Action
    ------      ------
    None        No centering
    Max Pixel   Centre on the pixel with maximum value in
                star aperture
    Centroid    Centre on the centroid of the pixel values
                in star aperture
    Gauss       Fit a Gaussian to the star aperture pixels
</pre><p>
  
   With the `Gauss' mode, one can set the Gauss radii to be fixed or
   floating.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 2.3.2 <a name="aperture_photometry"> Aperture photometry </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
   The whole subject of aperture photometry is not as simple as
   it looks at first appearence. It is recommended that the
   inexperienced user should read a book on astronomical photometry
   to understand the problems and possibilities fully.
<p>
  
   Some examples of the problems are:-
<p>
<ol>
<li> The use of the `median' mode in determining the sky level
     inside the sky aperture is better than using the `mean'
     mode, as this rejects against stars better? No! The main
     problem in aperture photometry is the presence of field stars
     in the star and sky apertures. If you reject strongly against
     the faint (ones you cant see by eye) stars in the sky
     aperture by using the `median', then the similar faint stars
     in the star aperture will not be balanced by those in the
     sky aperture, and the star will be measured too bright.
<p>
  
<li>  In choosing a location for the sky aperture, one should
      choose a place that is entirely free from field star? No!
      Again, such a place might be too free, compared to the star
      aperture location, and the star might be measured too bright.
<p>
  
<li>  When measuring a very faint star on a number of exposures,
      then when the flux in the star aperture is less than the
      sky level, so that one gets a negative flux, those exposures
      should be ingnored? No! You must average everything together.
<p>
  
<li>  When comparing a bright star and a faint star, it is better
      to use a smaller aperture on the faint star to cut down the
      sky noise? No! The profile of the bright and faint stars are
      the same, and thus using a smaller aperture on the faint
      star will cut out a greater fraction of the light of the
      faint star compared to the bright one.
<p>
  
<li>  When comparing stars in different exposures, one can use
      different size apertures? No! For the same reason as for 4).
<p>
  
<li>  When comparing stars in different exposures, one can use
      the same size apertures as when doing a single exposure?
      No! As the seeing will have varied between the different
      exposures, then the apertures must be large ones, so that
      the effect of the variable seeing does not cause a
      significantly diffrent amount of light to be lost out of
      the apertures in the different exposures. Typically apertures
      less than 10 or 20 arcsec diameter will lead to bad photometry.

 <h2> 2.4 <a name="colour"> Colour </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  The standard image display uses a grey-scale display. However, by
  use of the Colour group of functions, colour displays can be made.
  There are eight standard LUT tables available, and others can be
  read in from files.
<p>
  
  Also the user can adjust the LUT table currently being applied. This
  can be done:-
<p>
  
<ul>
<li> `Flip' the LUT.<p>
  
<li> Change display of values above and below ends of LUT. <p>
  
<li> Interactively using a cursor:- choose a colour from the
     displayed colour bar with the cursor and `paint' this colour
     over a range of the LUT. <p>
  
<li> Horizontal movement of the cursor (with a mouse button pressed) to
     rotate the LUT <p>
  
<li> Use horizontal and vertical movement of the cursor (with a
     mouse button pressed) to shift and scale the LUT. <p>
</ul>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 2.4.1 <a name="lut_bar"> Lut bar </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  There is an option to show the form of the Look&$95 Up&#95 Table. A
  bar can be painted across the bottom of the screen, containing
  from left to right the colours associated with the displays cells
  from 1 to 150, which are used to code the image values to display
  the image.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 2.4.2 <a name="lut_standards"> Lut standards </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  The eight standard LUT tables are:-
<p>
<ol>
<li> Grey scale
<li> Purple with light at top
<li> Rainbow
<li> Black/blue/green/yellow/purple/white
<li> Black/blue/greeny-yellow/dark red
<li> Black/blue/greeny-yellow/light red/white
<li> Discrete steps
        (black/blue/green/light blue/red/purple/yellow/white)
<li> Inverted grey scale
</ol>
<p>
  
  
<hr>
 <h2> 2.4.3 <a name="lut_storage"> Lut storage </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  The LUTs can be output in one format, the `full' format, and input
  in two formats, the `short' and `full' formats.
<p>
  
  The `full' format is:-
<p>
  
  This is a table containing the R,G,B fractional colour contributions
  in columns 1,2,3 of the table (ignoring the 1st 5 for table row
  names - which are not used). There are 150 rows in this table.
  Starting from the first row, there is the R,G,B set for the lowest
  location on the table, carrying onto the 150th row, where there is
  the highest LUT entry.
<p>
  
  There is also a scale `LUTSC', and a zero `LUTZE', in descriptors.
  These scale the LUT. A given entry point, say RV, which is
  bewteen 0.0 and 1.0, would normally go to the R,G,B set of the
  RV*150th row in the input LUT. Where it actually goes is
  the [(RV-LUTZE)/LUTSC]*150th entry. If this entry is below 1 or
  above 150, then the entry is either, set at 1 or 150, or set at
  its modulo 150 value.
<p>
  
  The `short' format is:-
<p>
  
  This is a way of making a simple table to input to the program.
<p>
  
  It is a table with 6 rows, and between 3 and 25 columns.

  Each row is allocated to as:-
  
              1      2      3       4     5      6
             Red   Red   Green   Green   Blue   Blue
            Posn  Value   Posn   Value   Posn  Value
</pre><p>
  
  The first column in a row indicated how many columns in that row are
  active, excluding itself.
<p>
  
  This is then converted into the LUT by:-
<p>
<ol>
<li> Taking the proportion for each colour at a step in the LUT. This
     is done by moving along the `Colour Posn' row until one reaches
     the point that the step in the LUT table is. Thus if the step is
     number 59 out of 150 steps, then its location is 0.252. In the
     example below, this for red would be just after the 2nd (0.25)
     Posn.
<p>
  
<li> Calculating the corresponding `Colour Value'. In the example below,
     this would be between the 2nd and 3rd values, so the Red fraction
     would be :-
<p>
  
<pre>
 Red fraction = [2nd value] +
                [3rd-2nd values]*
                [fraction of step to 3rd `Colour Position']
  
   in this case:-
  
       fraction = 0.00  +
                  (1.0-0.0)*{(0.252-0.25)/(0.5-0.25)}
  
  An example of this is the `short' LUT used for the
  `rainbow' LUT, no 3 above. It is:-
  
     4.0, 0.0, 0.25,  0.5,  1.0,  0.0, 0.0
     4.0, 0.0, 0.00,  1.0,  1.0,  0.0, 0.0
     6.0, 0.0, 0.125, 0.5, 0.64, 0.77, 1.0
     6.0, 0.0, 0.000, 1.0, 0.50, 0.00, 0.0
     5.0, 0.0, 0.25,  0.5, 0.77,  1.0, 0.0
     5.0, 0.0, 1.00,  0.0, 0.00,  1.0, 0.0

 ****  This colour system uses a Look-Up Table (LUT)  ****
<p>
  
 The actual pixel values in the image are already displayed
 by scaling and shifting so that a range of those values lies
 between 0 and 255. To each of these 256 -values-, a colour
 is now ascribed, by means of a Look-Up Table (LUT).
 These options allow you to change the colours ascribed to
 to each -value-, in a number of ways. Actual pixel values
 which fell outside the original range, can never have a range
 of colours, as they are all set at the end value. To change
 that, redisplay the image. Likewise for fine gradations.

 <h2> 3 <a name="panel"> Panel </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
 In the menu-driven mode of this program, there is the capability
 to interact with this menu in a `windows' type mode. If you choose
 the `Panel' option in the `Option' choice, then if you have an
 X-window device a small panel appears on the screen. This has what look
 like buttons with all the available options. You select these by
 putting a cursor on the `button' and then pressing a mouse button.
<p>
  
 The panel has a `help' button which lists out one line
 descriptions of all the options. This button also tells you what
 the program is doing:- 'working', 'waiting', etc.
<p>
  
  
<hr>
 <h2> 4 <a name="mouse_buttons"> Mouse buttons </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
 The mouse buttons have many uses, and which button does what is
 described in the six-line help displayed, when in the `panel'
 mode.
<p>
  
 The cursor must be in image window area for the cursor buttons
 to work when in -WORKING- mode. The window also must be -active-
 - that is the bar at the top must be set. Click on this bar if
 it is not, before using the buttons.
<p>
  
 If the cursor is outside a displayed area, often pressing the button
 will result in no actions.
<p>
  
 For many of the groups of functions, then when a cursor is being
 used, the X,Y position and image pixel value are continuously
 displayed on the `panel', if the panel mode is being used.
<p>
  
 For a more detailed exposition on mouse cursor/button use when
 in the various groups of options, see the sub-sections under
 `options' in the top level help.
<p>
  
  
 Two examples of very common uses:-
<p>
<pre>
   Mouse buttons for Zoom/Pan work:-
  
      Left Button twice              = zoom /2
      Centre Button twice            = zoom x2
      Left Button then Centre Button = pan
      Right button once              = exit
  
</pre>
  
    Zoom means zoom around present position of cursor
    Pan means set present position of cursor to screen centre
<p><pre>
  
   Mouse buttons for Cvalues work:-
  
   The values are output continuously again on the panel, or
   by request on the terminal if the panel is not being used.
  
      -Panel- mode?    Button actions
      ------------     --------------

 <h2> 5 <a name="colour"> Colour </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  The standard image display uses a grey-scale display. However, by
  use of the `colour' group of functions, colour displays can
  be made. There are eight standard LUT tables available, and others
  can be read in from files.
<p>
  
  Colour includes grey scale.
<p>
  
  Also the user can adjust the LUT table currently being applied. This
  can be done directly:- `flip' the LUT;Change display of values above
  and below ends of LUT. It can also be done interactively using a
  cursor:- with the use of the display of a colour bar, pick a colour
  with the cursor and `paint' this colour over a range of the LUT; Use
  horizontal movement of the cursor (with a mouse button pressed) to rotate
  the LUT; Use horizontal and vertical movement of the cursor (with a
  mouse button pressed) to shift and scale the LUT.

  The program puts out the images for the display on X-window
  devices.
<p>
  
  There is also the option to use PGPLOT to do one single image
  output to a device with a GKS driver. This is to output a
  grey-scale picture of an area of the image. This has the use
  that hard copies can be made, and unusal devices utilised to
  look at the image.
<p>
  
  GRAPHICAL DISPLAY

   In the annulus work, the sky area is taken as that between the
   sky annulus inner ring and the sky annulus outer ring.
   In non-annulus work, the sky aperture is a simple circle, placed
   as specified.
<p>
  
   `Bad pixels' are ignored. Thus in the sky estimates this should
   not make much trouble, but in the Star estimates it will if the
   relevant pixel has a value above the sky level.
<p>
  
   The apertures have `smooth' edges. The circle that gives the
   edge of the aperture will fall `through' the body of some of the
   pixels at the edge of the aperture. What happens then is that these
   `edge' pixels are subdivided into a 5x5 subarray, and each sub-pixel
   is looked at to see if it is in or out of the aperture. The area of
   the pixel, for the program purposes, is then (number/25.0). The
   flux in the pixel is then scaled down to the same extent.
<p>
  
   Errors:-
<p>
  
   The errors are calculated assuming that the pixel values are due
   to a source with Poisson noise (which has suffered scaling) and
   an extra `magic' source of noise (with zero effect on the mean
   pixel value).
  
<pre>
   Thus the pixel variance = Flux*(`Poiss' value) +
               (no of pixels)*(`Noise' value)*(`Noise' value)
  
   [Std dev = square root(variance)]
</pre>
  
   The star error is then calculated assuming that noise in the star
   flux, and noise due to the error in calculating the sky level.

<p>
  
  This is a table containing the R,G,B fractional colour contributions
  in columns 1,2,3 of the table (ignoring the 1st 5 for table row
  names - which are not used). There are 150 rows in this table.
  Starting from the first row, there is the R,G,B set for the lowest
  location on the table, carrying onto the 150th row, where there is
  the highest LUT entry.
<p>
  
  There is also a scale `LUTSC', and a zero `LUTZE', in descriptors.
  These scale the LUT. A given entry point, say RV, which is
  bewteen 0.0 and 1.0, would normally go to the R,G,B set of the
  RV*150th row in the input LUT. Where it actually goes is
  the [(RV-LUTZE)/LUTSC]*150th entry. If this entry is below 1 or
  above 150, then the entry is either, set at 1 or 150, or set at
  its modulo 150 value.

 <h2> 11.4 <a name="fit_magns_output"> Fit magns output </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  The output of the Interact:fit&#95 magns group, `OUTTAB', is a file
  containing a table of the magnitude measures.
<p>
  
  The headers are:  `X', `Y', `Magnitude', `Dx', `Dy', `Iterations',
                    `Rms', `Numinval', `Height', `Base', `Max pixel',

 <h2> 11.6 <a name="scrutiny_output"> Scrutiny output </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  One output of the Interact:Scrutiny group, `OUTSTARS', is a file
  containing a table in the format of the Starman:Measure program,
  of that input Starman:measure table, but with (optionally) some stars
  removed, and (optionally) some extra stars added. These extra stars
  are picked up in the Interact:Scrutiny group of functions
<p>
  
  The other output, `OUTFILE', is a text file containing a selection
  of the input Starman:Measure table of fitted results. The user
  selects the option to `print' the table in a defined format to
  this file. The file is a normal ASCII text file

 <h2> 12.1 <a name="general:-"> GENERAL:- </h2> </a> <p>
  
  
  The parameters that are used by more than one program group.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.2 <a name="blink_ch"> Blink&#95 ch </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - last, start `under'    <br> Choice - `under:over:auto:exit')
<p>
  
  Where to put the window for a `blink'. The blink is achieved by
  putting the display window `under' or `over' any other window
  that is in the same place. [Thus you should have used another
  window to open up another display window with the image, and placed
  it in the same position as the display window of this program.]
<p>
<pre>
  Choice     Function
  ------     --------
  auto       Blink by alternatively putting it on top then under
  exit       Return from this option
  over       Place window on top of any other
  under      Place window under any other
</pre>
  
  In automatic blinking, then the displayed image is alternately
  `popped' and `pushed'. The time interval starts of at 1/2 second,
  and is lengthed or shortened by pressing keys on the mouse.
<p>
  
  The keys have the functions:-
<pre>
  
         Left Button   = slow blink by x2
         Centre Button = speed blink by x2
         Right Button  = switch to hand blink
</pre>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.3 <a name="easystart"> Easystart </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - `yes'            <br> Choice - `yes:no')
<p>
  
   Use the standard start sequence of operations?
<p>
  
   This quickly gets an image, displays it in the standard way, sets
   up the panel buttons, and gets you going.
<p>
  
   The alternative is simply to go into the normal `OPTION'
   method of the program asking you for instructions. You would want
   to use this if you wished not to display the image at first, or
   not use the panel buttons, or display the image in a non-standard
   way.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.4 <a name="gtype"> Gtype </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - `xwindows'            <br> Choice - any)
<p>
  
  A character string giving the local name for the graphics
  display type.
<p>
  
  `xwindows' will put it out on the screen of your X-window device,
  if you are using one.
<p>
  
  If `ask' is input, then the program asks a very similar question,
  in a different way. A response here of `?' will bring up a listing
  of all the possible names of graphics devices which are supported
  on your machine, and you then input the appropriate name.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.5 <a name="in"> In </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - null)
<p>
  
 The name of the file containing the input 2-D image.
<p>
  
 A null `return' entry is not allowed at the very start of the
 program. Later on, it may be, in which case the program
 will continue. Sometimes four repeated `null' entries will be
 needed to get to this continue.
<p>
  
 This image can be either the `real' 32-bit real or the `short'
 16-bit integer' NDF format.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.6 <a name="imcomp"> Imcomp </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - variable, usually 1,1     <br> Range  - 1 to 1000)
<p>
  
  Factor in X and Y by which to compress the displayed image.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.7 <a name="imposn"> Imposn </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - so as to centre image in screen
    <br> Range  -  -100000 to 100000)
<p>
  
  Place to put b.l.h. corner of displayed image onto the
  screen. Thus an answer of `1,1' would put the b.l.h. pixel
  of the displayed image at the b.l.h corner of the screen.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.8 <a name="linecol"> Linecol </h2> </a> <p>
  
   (Default - `black'            <br> Choice - (black:white)
<p>
  
    Colour of plot lines. This is determined by whether you have a
    black or white background to your plots.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.9 <a name="numbutt"> Numbutt </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - see below          <br> Range - 2 to 3)
<p>
  
  Number of `X-Window' buttons available on the mouse.
<p>
  
  Some devices have two and some have three buttons available. This
  can depend both on their actual presence, and also on the X Windows
  software that is being run.
<p>
  
  With three buttons, then the Starman programs use all three, with
  the right-hand button being used mainly as the `exit' button.
<p>
  
  With two buttons, then the third button is simulated by pressing
  both of the buttons down, with the middle one being pressed slightly
  BEFORE the left-hand one. Use of the middle button in its normal
  way has to be modified, in that one has to pause for half a second
  after using it.
<p>
  
  [This parameter is usally `hidden', with the machine manager setting
   it to the appropriate value for the local set-up. Sometimes it will
   be left to the user to set, depending on his software configuartion.]
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.10 <a name="screen"> Screen </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - described below      <br> Range - 1 to size of device)
<p>
  
  Size of window to open on image display.
<p>
  
  Not asked for if not a windows type display.
<p>
  
  This the size of the screen or window to use, input as two integers
  for the X and Y size.
<p>
  
  If the image is bigger than the screen, it will be binned down to
  fit in.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.11 <a name="title"> Title </h2> </a> <p>

  The `contrast' of the screen display.
<p>
  
  The lower and upper limits of the pixel value range that will
  be shown as black to white on the display screen.
<p>
  
  The display of pixel values above and below these limits is
  controlled by the value of the `wrap' parameter. They are shown

 It is the entry option choice. You repeatedly get asked for options.
 You select one of the menu operations. A number of these - the

 When you started the program, you were asked for the input image and
 input star table. Then you started on this option choice. Generally the
 default option is a repeat of the last option. However at the start,
 a standard set of options is given as the default.

 <h2> 12.18 <a name="area"> Area </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 1,1,1,1 or last       <br> Range - 1 to max size of image)
<p>
  
  The four integer values for the X and Y coords of the b.l.h.
  corner and t.r.h. corner of the area of the image to be used.
 <p>
  
 (input as x start, y start, x end, y end)
<p>
  
  This be used to cut out that area or to set to INVALID.
 <p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.19 <a name="bin"> Bin </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 1,1       <br> Range - 1 to max size of image)
<p>
  
  The two integer values for the X and Y compressions.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.20 <a name="box"> Box </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 3,3        <br> Range - 1 to max size of image)
<p>
  
  The two integer values for the X and Y sides of the box
  to be used for the `top-hat' box averaging or the `median'
  box averaging.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.21 <a name="check"> Check </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 'no'      <br> Choice - `yes:no')
<p>
  
  When using the `top-hat' averaging, do we check for `bad'
  (INVALID) pixels, and set the output average value for the box
  that contains any such pixels as `bad'? In this case, the
  answer is 'yes'.
<p>
  
  Or do we just ignore such pixels, and make the average the
  average of all the `good' pixels?  In this case, the
  answer is 'no'.
<p>
  
  (In both cases, a box that contains only `bad' pixels will be
   set to `INVALID'.)
<p>
  
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.22 <a name="doit"> Doit </h2> </a> <p>
  
 (Default - 'no'      <br> Choice - `yes:no')
<p>
  
  Perform, or not, a second smoothing in the unsharp masking.
<p>
  
  This is often done so that signal can be removed at both long
  and short scales. In this case, then in one of the smoothings,
  a box with a small side is used, and in the other, one with a
  large side.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.23 <a name="eqn"> Eqn </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - null          <br> Choice - as defined below)
<p>
  
  The FORTRAN-style expression that gives the elements in the
  pixels of the output image.
<p>
  
  Its style is given the `equation' section of this help.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.24 <a name="fraction"> Fraction </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 0.8        <br> Range - 0.0 to 1.0e20)
<p>
  
 The fraction of the values of the smoothed image that are
 to be subtracted from the original image.
<p>
  
 A value of 0.8 often gives a nice removal of most of the unwanted
 signal, whilst leaving enough to keep all values positive, and
 also some indication of the original signal.
<p>
  
 It will be a matter of experimentation what value is appropriate
 to the actual image being unsharp-masked.
<p>
  
 Thus after the subtraction is done and displayed, the user is
 asked, via the `MORE' parameter, if a new value is to be tried.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.25 <a name="gbox"> Gbox </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 10 x X,Y star radii       <br> Range - 1 to max size of image)
<p>
  
  The two integer values for the X and Y sides of the box
  to be used for the `gaussian' box averaging.
<p>
  
  Each value must be an odd number.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.26 <a name="gradius"> Gradius </h2> </a> <p>
  
 (Default - 2.0     <br> Range - 1.0e-5 to 1.0e10)
<p>
  
  The radius of the circular Gaussian profile to be used in
  doing theGaussian smoothing.
<pre>
  
                                -1.0*(d/r)**2
  The profile is taken as:-    e
  
  where   d = distance from profile centre in pixels,
          r = GRADIUS
</pre>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.27 <a name="inim"> Inim </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - null)
<p>
  
 The input image corresponding to one of the `IB' to `IZ' to be used
 in the arithmetic expression.
<p>
  
 The `IB', `IC', ..., `IZ' in the equation pick up the images from
 the parameters `INB', `INC', ..., `INZ'.
<p>

 (`IA' is reserved to mean the presently displayed image.)
<p>
  
 The input images must be standard Starman ADAM .SDF images, with
 either `real' 32-bit real values, or `short' 16-bit integer values.
 They can have the `BSCALE' and `BZERO' values, and `magic pixel values'
 indicating `bad' pixels.
<p>
  
 The `help' for all these is kept here, for `inim'.

<p>
  
  The value to be used in the equation for the value of
  the desired variable, from the range `A', `B', ..., `Z'.
<p>
  
  The `help' for all these is kept here, for `invar'.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.29 <a name="more"> More </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 'yes'      <br> Choice - `yes:no')
<p>
  
 In doing the unsharp masking, do you want to have another
 go at subtracting the smoothed image from the original image?
<p>
  
 This enables you to input a new value of the factor by which
 the smoothed image is multiplied before being subtracted.
<p>
  
 See the comments on the `FRACTION' parameter above for why
 this is useful.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.29 <a name="nxy"> Nxy </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 1,1    <br>         Range - 1 to 100000)
<p>
  
  If there are no input images, the user has the choice of the size of
  the output image.
<p>
  
  This parameter defines the `X' and 'Y' sizes of the output image.

  (Default - 1,1,1.0     Range - -1.0e20 to  1.0e20)
<p>
  
  The X,Y position of the pixel and the value to assign to it.
<p>
  
  The X,Y numbers are input as real numbers, but the user can
  put them in as integers. Thus - 10,10,3.4 -  will set the
  value of pixel (10,10) to 3.4,
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.33 <a name="range"> Range </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 0.0,0.0          <br> Range - -1.0e20 to 1.0e20)
<p>
  
  Range of pixel values, such that if a pixel had a value within that
  range, the pixel is set to `invalid'.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.34 <a name="rotate"> Rotate </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 0.0     <br> Range - 1.0e-20 to 1.0e20)
<p>
  
 The angle in degrees through which to rotate the image in a
 counter-clockwise direction.
<p>
  
 After rotation, if the image is not orthogonal to the X and Y axes,
 it is placed within a larger image, so that the new `bottom' corner
 is at the bottom of the image, and the new `left-hand' corner is
 at the left of the image.

 <h2> 12.35 <a name="sample"> Sample </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 'highest'       <br> Choice - 'sample:highest:average' )
<p>
  
  Method of extracting output value from binning box:-
<pre>
  
  Option    Choice
  ------    ------
  Average  Take average of all pixels
  Highest  Take highest pixel
  Sample   Take value of bottom left hand pixel in box

 <h2> 12.36 <a name="seed"> Seed </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 1234567891 <br>   Range - 1200000001 to 1400000001)
<p>
  
  The seed number to be used in any random number generators.
  This is used in the `GAUSS()' and `RAN()' operators. These
  will provide the same pattern of numbers in the same
  seed number is input.
<p>
  
  It has to be a large positive odd number.
<p>
  
<hr>
 <h2> 12.37 <a name="smethod"> Smethod </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - 'box' or `median'      <br> Choice - 'gauss:box:median')
<p>
  
  Which smoothing method to use.
<pre>
  
  Option    Choice
  ------    ------
  Gauss     Run a rectangular box over the whole image, taking
            the average of the pixels using a weight given by
            the value of a circular Gaussian profile centered
            at the box centre.
  
  Box       Run a rectangular box over the whole image, taking
            the average of the pixels within the box.
  
  Median    Run a rectangular box over the whole image, taking
            the median of the pixels within the box.
</pre>
  
  
  For all three methods, the result is normalised, so that a flat
  image would result in an identical output.
<p>
  
  When the box overlaps the edges of the image, only the pixels
  inside the image are taken.

 <h2> 12.66 <a name="method"> Method </h2> </a> <p>
  
  (Default - present value, starting `annulus'
   <br> Choice - `annulus:separate')
<p>
  
  Method to determine the area used to get the sky level.
<p>
  
  There are two ways of selecting areas the area to be used for
  determining the sky level. These are an annulus round the star,
  and a separate circular area elsewhere in the image.
<p>
  
  The advantage of using an annulus is that this gives a good
  estimate of the mean level at the star itself. The disadvantage
  is that a significantly bright star may be present in that
  annulus. With the use of a separate area, an area free of
  significant stars can be chosen.
<p>
  
  If the `separate' mode is used, then the sky level adopted
  for each star is that determined from the last sky level
  determination. Such determinations can be made as frequently as
  desired.
<p>
  
  In the `annulus' mode, the inner and outer radii of the annulus
  can be set separately.
<p>
  
  For a fuller discussion on the problems of determining sky levels,
  see the `help' in `Options' - `Aperture Options'.

  (Default - present value, start=0.0          <br> Range - 0.0 to 1.0e16)
<p>
  
  The amount of extra noise that is actually present in each pixel,
  above the amount the program can find.
<p>
  
  The program thinks that the only source of noise is the Poisson
  noise of the counts (scaled by the `Poiss' parameter input factor).
  This `Noise' parameter allows you to put in another source of
  noise. An example could be the `read-out' noise of a CCD.
<p>
  
  The `Noise' is the standard deviation ofsuch an extra source of
  noise.

</pre>
  
  
   In the annulus work, the sky area is taken as that between the sky
   inner annulus ring and the sky outer annulus ring.
   In non-annulus work, the sky aperture is a simple circle, placed
   as specified.
<p>
  
   `Bad pixels' are ignored. Thus in the sky estimates this should
   not make much trouble, but in the Star estimates it will if the
   relevant pixel has a value above the sky level.
<p>
  
   The apertures have `smooth' edges. The circle that gives the
   edge of the aperture will fall `through' the body of some of the
   pixels at the edge of the aperture. What happens then is that these
   `edge' pixels are subdivided into a 5x5 subarray, andeach sub-pixel
   is looked at to see if it is in or out of the aperture. The area of
   the pixel, for the program purposes, is then (number/25.0). The
   flux in the pixel is then scaled down to the same extent.
<p>
  
   Errors:-
<p>
  
   The errors are calculated assuming that the pixel values are due
   to a source with Poisson noise (which has suffered scaling) and
   an extra `magic' source of noise (with zero effect on the mean
   pixel value).
<p>
<pre>
   Thus the pixel variance = Flux*(`Poiss' value) +
               (no of pixels)*(`Noise' value)*(`Noise' value)
  
   [Std dev = square root(variance)]
</pre>
  
   The star error is then calculated assuming that noise in the star
   flux, and noise due to the error in calculating the sky level.

 The scaling that would have to be applied to pixel values so that
 their values would have a Poissonian distribution.
<p>
  
 This is used to calculate the error on a flux level.
<p>
<pre>
 The error used (squared) = Flux*(`Poiss' value) +
            (no of pixels)*(`Noise' value)*(`Noise' value)

 This enables the output error estimates to be reasonably correct.

  ****  This colour system uses a Look-Up Table (LUT)  ****
<p>
  
 The actual pixel values in the image are already displayed
 by scaling and shifting so that a range of those values lies
 between 0 and 255. To each of these 256 -values-, a colour
 is now ascribed, by means of a Look-Up Table (LUT).
 These options allow you to change the colours ascribed to
 to each -value-, in a number of ways. Actual pixel values
 which fell outside the original range, can never have a range
 of colours, as they are all set at the end value. To change
 that, redisplay the image. Likewise for fine gradations.

  Starting from the first row, there is the R,G,B set for the lowest
  location on the table, carrying onto the 150th row, where there is
  the highest LUT entry.
<p>
  
  There is also a scale `LUTSC', and a zero `LUTZE', in descriptors.
  These scale the LUT. A given entry point, say RV, which is
  bewteen 0.0 and 1.0, would normally go to the R,G,B set of the
  RV*150th row in the input LUT. Where it actually goes is
  the [(RV-LUTZE)/LUTSC]*150th entry. If this entry is below 1 or
  above 150, then the entry is either, set at 1 or 150, or set at
  its modulo 150 value.

<p>
  
   These are the radii out at which the profile is 1/e of the
   peak value. The profile is elliptical, but orthogonal to the
   X and Y axes. If the radii are kept fixed (set through the RADFIX
   parameter), then these are the radii used. If they are not
   fixed, then these are the start values for the fitting, and they
   get refined through the fitting to produce the best fit. In this
   case, it is hepful to the fitting if these start values are close
   to the actual values.

            where `X' is a character string, input via the parameter
            `Prefix'. `X' has a default of `A', and it is recommended
            that only a short character string be used, since the
            total name length is only 20.
<p>
  
<dt>  If `No',
<dd> then all the output stars are renamed as #1, #2, ...
