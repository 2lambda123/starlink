% ? Document Abstract. (if used)
%   ==================

During 1990 Jul to 1991 Jan, the \ro Wide Field Camera (WFC) performed
the first all--sky survey at extreme--ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths.
The whole sky, or $\approx 96$\% of it, was imaged in two passbands, S1
and S2, covering the ranges 60--140\AA~and 110--200\AA~respectively.
An initial bright source catalogue (BSC) of 383 sources was produced by
Pounds \etal (1993, MNRAS, 260, 77).  A new list, the 2RE~Catalogue
(Pye \etal 1995, MNRAS, 274, 1165), of 479 sources has recently been
published.  The survey data \emph{i.e.}, images and `raw' photon event files
are now in the public domain.  The REPACK software package has been
developed to fully exploit these data.  This document describes the
REPACK programs.

\section{\label{se_introduction}\xlabel{introduction}Introduction}

The survey data, as produced for the 2RE processing, is available to
the public through the Leicester Data Archive Service (LEDAS). Images
were sorted from the event files and screened for `high background' and
'moon in WFC field-of-view' and named after the ecliptic latitude and
longitude of the region of sky that they covered \emph{e.g.}, {\tt
im012014\_f1} and {\tt im012014\_f2} --- one for each survey passband.
They are $\approx 2.7^{\circ} \times 2.7^{\circ}$ in extent with a
resolution of $1 \times 1$ arcmin$^{2}$ per pixel.  The photon event
files are overlaid on a similar ecliptic grid system.  Some 13~000
image pairs and 13~000 event files were produced by this scheme,
covering almost the whole sky.

Images can be retrieved in various formats; HDS, FITS and GIF. The
REPACK software only operates on HDS format images. Event files,
available just in FITS format, can be sorted to ASTERIX (HDS) datasets
such as images and light-curves.

REPACK is supported under UNIX (Digital Unix, Solaris 2).

\section{\label{se_retrieving_images}\xlabel{retrieving_images}Retrieving Images and Photon Event Files}

The recommended  way of retrieving [\ro WFC survey] images and photon event 
files is to first go to the LEDAS page on the World Wide Web via the URL:

\begin{quote}{\tt
\htmladdnormallink{http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/}%
{http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/}}
\end{quote}

The database tables held by the LEDAS can be accessed either via the
BROWSE database system, or via the WWW-based ARNIE interface. Users
should endeavour to locate the \ro WFC survey tables 1) ROSWFCSI for
the images, 2) ROSWFCSE for the raw photon event files, and 3)
ROSWFC2RE for the 2RE source list.  If the BROWSE route is taken,
supplying some search cone and then using the {\tt xp} command, image
pairs (one per waveband) can be selected and retrieved.  A similar
technique can be used to obtain photon event files.  If extraction
completes successfully users should find image and event files, of the
form {\tt im{\it nnnnnn}\_f{\it n}.sdf} and/or {\tt x{\it nnn}y{\it
nn}.fit}, in their current directory.

The LEDAS also provides easy-to-use access to the WFC survey image
database via the WFC Survey Image Browser: 

\begin{quote}{\tt
\htmladdnormallink{http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/WFCimage}%
{http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/WFCimage}}
\end{quote}

\section{\label{se_repack_programs}\xlabel{repack_programs}The REPACK Programs}

Having obtained some \ro WFC survey data, it would be useful to have some
software to help analyse it.  The REPACK package aims to fulfill this
task.  Some of its features, such as locating images \emph{etc.}, are
adequately covered by the LEDAS-BROWSE interface (see
Section~\ref{se_retrieving_images}), but it is nonetheless important to
have a self consistent set of programs.

All REPACK programs have a {\tt `re'} prefix.  Some of them have been
wrapped up into {\tt csh} scripts, described in
Section~\ref{se_shell_scripts}, to minimise user interaction for some
of the more common operations.  The REPACK programs, presented in the
order in which they would normally be used in a data analysis session,
are as follows:

\begin{verbatim}

     re_imsrch     Names image whose centre is closest to input co-ordinates.
     re_evsrch     Names event files touched by input search cone.
     re_fitmrg     Merges a set of (FITS) event files.
     re_expos      Returns survey exposure, in seconds, at input co-ordinates.
     re_sort       Sorts (FITS) event files to images, time-series etc.
     re_imexp      Exposure corrects an (HDS) image.
     re_timexp     Exposure corrects a time-series.

\end{verbatim}

If REPACK has been properly installed at the users site then all of the
above programs will be accessible after the startup commands have been
executed:

\begin{verbatim}
    % aststart
    % re_start
\end{verbatim}

All programs are started by simply typing their name on the command line.
On-line parameters can also be specified, \emph{e.g.}: 

\begin{verbatim} 
    % re_sort evefil=mrgd_ev \\
\end{verbatim}  

Where possible some of the program parameters supply the user with a
sensible default value.  The next section describes each of the
programs and their parameters.  Some hints are also given as to
parameter values.

\subsection{\label{ss_re_imsrch}\xlabel{re_imsrch}re\_imsrch}

This program is useful for locating the image that surveyed the
position of some source.  It returns the name of the image whose centre
is closest to the specified RA \& Dec.  The total number of counts in
each filter passband is also shown as is the RA \& Dec of the image
centre and the separation between the desired and present positions.

A similar feature is also available in BROWSE using the ROSWFCSI table
(see Section \ref{se_retrieving_images}).  Further, the appropriate
image can be retrieved.

\subsubsection{Parameters}

\begin{description}
\item[GET (Y/N)  ]
Yes if RA and DEC co-ordinates are to be input from a file.
No if from the command line.
\item[FILENAME  ] file containing one or more co-ordinate pairs.
\item[SRA  ] 
The RA co-ordinate to be searched.  It may be specified in
decimal or sexagesimal degrees.
\item[SDEC  ] 
The Dec co-ordinate to be searched.  It may be specified in
decimal or sexagesimal degrees.
\item[WRITE (Y/N)  ]
Yes to Write the results into a file.
\item[OUTPUT  ]
File to contain results.
\end{description}

\subsection{\label{ss_re_evsrch}\xlabel{re_evsrch}re\_evsrch}

This program is useful for locating the event files required to form an
image centred on some location.  Given a search cone it returns the
name(s) of the survey event files wholly or partially enclosed.  For
convenience these names are written to the file {\tt re\_evmrg.list}
which can be used as input to the event file merging program
\htmlref{{\tt re\_fitmrg}}{ss_re_fitmrg} (see Section~\ref{ss_re_fitmrg}).

A similar feature is also available in BROWSE using the ROSWFCSE table.  
Further, the appropriate event files can be retrieved.

\subsubsection{Parameters}

\begin{description}

\item[SRA  ] 
The RA of the search cone.  It may be specified in
decimal or sexagesimal degrees.
\item[SDEC  ] 
The Dec of the search cone.  It may be specified in
decimal or sexagesimal degrees.
\item[RAD  ] 
The radius of the search cone.  It may be specified in only decimal
degrees. A typical radius, if a time-series is to be the sorted product
for example, may be $1^{\circ}$.
\end{description}

\subsection{\label{ss_re_fitmrg}\xlabel{re_fitmrg}re\_fitmrg}	

Event files need to merged before they can be sorted into images
\emph{etc.}, if it is shown by \htmlref{{\tt re\_evsrch}}{ss_re_evsrch}
that several event files are needed to map some chosen region of sky.
The program makes a copy of the first input event file and them appends
the rest updating appropriate keywords along the way.  Certain file
consistency checks such as on data format revision numbers, are also
performed.

The {\tt csh} script file \htmlref{{\tt re\_fitmrgsh}}{se_shell_scripts}
makes merging even easier --- see Section~\ref{se_shell_scripts}.

\subsubsection{Parameters}

\begin{description}

\item[LIST  ] 
The list of event files to be merged.  A text file containing file
names can be used as input.  If {\tt TERMINAL} is the supplied response
then the names can be entered from the keyboard and the list terminated
with a {\tt Ctrl-D}.  The default file extension is {\tt .fit} and need
not be supplied by the user.
\item[OUT  ] 
The name to be given to the new merged event file.  The default extension is 
{\tt .fit}.
\item[DELFIL ] 
If an output file of the same name already exists the option is given of
either overwriting it or aborting the program.
\end{description}

\subsection{\label{ss_re_expos}\xlabel{re_expos}re\_expos}

Using the \ro WFC survey sky exposure images {\tt reskyexp\_f1.fit} and
{\tt reskyexp\_f2.fit}, this program exposure corrects a source search
dataset (SSDS) produced from the ASTERIX point source searching program
PSS, or gives the exposure, in seconds, at locations specified by the
user. Both instrument vignetting and dead-time are accounted for.

\subsubsection{Parameters}

\begin{description}

\item[FILT  ] 
Survey filter, S1a or S2a, for which exposure is required.  Each passband has 
its own exposure map ({\tt reskyexp\_f1.fit} for S1 and {\tt reskyexp\_f2.fit}
for S2).
\item[EFFCOR  ]
 Allows a correction for degradation of detector efficiency.  Can be used
to give `at launch' values.  Count rates given in the 2RE catalogue have
had this correction applied.
\item[SLIST  ]    
Name of the PSS SSDS file (default extension {\tt .sdf}).  A text file of 
decimal RAs and Decs, comma   separated, can also be supplied.  If this input 
file has the name {\tt posns.dat} for example, the exposure information will 
be placed  in a file called {\tt posns.exp}.  If {\tt TERMINAL} is the supplied
response then RAs and Decs, in decimals, can be input directly from the 
keyboard. The program then returns exposure times when it receives 
a {\tt Ctrl-D}.
\item[CLIST   ]
 If a SSDS file is being processed, then an output file containing the
 newly corrected source counts can be specified.  A name is suggested by
the program.  The default extension is {\tt .sdf}.
\end{description}

\subsection{\label{ss_re_imexp}\xlabel{re_imexp}re\_imexp}	

Using the sky survey exposure maps {\tt reskyexp\_f1.fit} and {\tt
reskyexp\_f2.fit}, and WFC configuration file {\tt re\_slots.fit},
this program exposure corrects a (HDS) survey image.  It automatically
figures out which passband the image is in (S1 or S2).  Instrument
vignetting and dead-time are allowed for.

\subsubsection{Parameters}

\begin{description}
\item[INP   ]
Name of (HDS) image to be exposure corrected.  The default file extension
is {\tt .sdf} and need not be supplied by the user.
\item[EFFCOR  ]
Allows a correction for degradation of detector efficiency.  Can be used
to give `at launch' values.  Count rates given in the 2RE catalogue have
had this correction applied.
\item[OUT   ]
Name of (HDS) corrected image.  An output name is suggested by the
program. The default file extension is {\tt .sdf}.
\end{description}

\subsection{\label{ss_re_sort}\xlabel{re_sort}re\_sort}	

This program `sorts' (FITS) survey event files into ASTERIX (HDS)
datasets such as images and time-series.  If events from a range of
files are too be sorted to the same output file then they should first
be merged using \htmlref{{\tt re\_fitmrg}}{ss_re_fitmrg} (see
Section~\ref{ss_re_fitmrg}).

\subsubsection{Parameters}

\begin{description}
\item[EVEFIL   ]
Name of (FITS) event file to be sorted.  The default file extension is 
{\tt .fit} and need not be supplied by the user.
\item[SHOW   ]
If {\tt Y} is the reply to the prompt, then some summary information on the
event file being sorted is displayed.
\item[DTYPE   ]
 Type of ASTERIX (HDS) dataset to be produced.  Options are:

\begin{verbatim}
     (I)mage   to create an ASTERIX sky coord image dataset.
     (L)in     to create a linearised detector coord image.
     (T)ime    to create a time series dataset.
     (E)vent   to create an event dataset.
\end{verbatim}

Uses of images and time-series are self evident.  Event sets can be
useful for accurate timing work.  Linear images are for specialist
technical/instrument investigations.
\item[RA]
The Right Ascension of the sort field centre. This can be entered as
decimal or sexagesimal degrees.
\item[DEC]
The Declination of the sort field centre. This can be entered as
decimal or sexagesimal degrees.
\item[DAZ]
The half azimuthal extent of the field to be sorted (degs).  For example the 
survey images in the BROWSE table ROSWFCSI were created with DAZ \& DEL set to 
80/60 and NXPIX \& NYPIX set to 160.  These values give images of dimension 
$160 \times 160$ arcminutes with a resolution of 1 pixel per arcmin$^{2}$.
\item[DEL]
The half elevation extent of the field to be sorted (degs).
\item[NXPIX]
The number of pixels along azimuthal side of the image. 
\item[NYPIX]
The number of pixels along elevation side of the image. 
\item[INRAD]
In time series mode INRAD specifies the inner radius of an annulus
from which to select events. The radius should be specified in arcminutes
and may be set to zero in order to select from a circular region.
\item[OUTRAD]
In time series mode OUTRAD specifies the outer radius of an annulus
from which to select events. The radius should be specified in
arcminutes.  Typical values are 3 arcminutes for sources and 9 arcminutes
for local background estimates if INRAD is set to zero.
\item[BREJ ]
A background mask was created during the survey processing to
maximise signal-to-noise for images.  It is recommended to use this
option -- it needn't be used for time-series.
\item[MREJ ]
During the survey, the moon would occasionally appear in the WFC
filed-of-view.  This option allows the user to reject such lunar events.
\item[FILTER]
A text string definition of the filter to use. This is selected from
the second column of the following table

\begin{verbatim}
      MCF #        Filter        Material

      6             S2A          Le/Be
      8             S1A          Le/C/B4C
 
      (MCF = Master Calibration File)
\end{verbatim}

\item[TLO  ]
The time from which to start event sorting.   The units are absolute
MJD.  (When performing background subtraction of two concentric
time-series it is important that the two time-series be co-binned and
so TLO should be chosen to be the same for both. It is recommended to
use the {\tt csh} script \htmlref{{\tt re\_light}}{se_shell_scripts}, see
Section~\ref{se_shell_scripts}, to perform this task).
\item[THI ]
The time to end event sorting.   The units are absolute MJD.
\item[NBINS]
The number of bins into which the time extent of the sort 
is to be divided. If a value '0' is given the program prompts for the
time duration for each bin (see TBIN).
\item[TBIN]
If NBIN is specified as 0 then TBIN should be set to the required
time duration of a bin (in seconds).  It is common to bin survey time-series on
the \ro spacecraft orbit of 5760 seconds --- a source could only be
observed for a maximum of $\sim 80$secs once per orbit.
\item[IRAD]
This gives the option of `stopping down' the radius of the WFC
field-of-view.  The units are degrees, the default is the full field
($\approx 5^{\circ}$ in diameter).
\item[OUTPUT]
The name of the output dataset. The default extension for the file is 
{\tt .sdf } and need not be supplied by the user.
\end{description}

\subsection{\label{ss_re_timexp}\xlabel{re_timexp}re\_timexp}  

This program exposure corrects a survey (HDS) time-series for
vignetting, dead-time, and point spread function as well as raw
exposure.  Essentially `on-axis' count rates are returned.   It expects
to find two files that contain information on spacecraft attitude and
instrument house-keeping rates ({\tt re\_ateres.fit} and {\tt
re\_hkrres.fit} respectively).

\subsubsection{Parameters}

\begin{description}
\item[INP   ]
Name of (HDS) time-series to be exposure corrected. The default extension is 
{\tt .sdf } and need not be supplied by the user.
\item[SRC   ]
If the input time-series is for a source, rather than a background
region, then answer {\tt Y} so that a point-spread-function correction
can be applied.
\item[OUT   ]
Name of (HDS) corrected time-series. The program suggests a file name.
The default extension is {\tt .sdf}. Note that the {\tt csh} script
\htmlref{{\tt re\_light}}{se_shell_scripts}, see
Section~\ref{se_shell_scripts}, produces an exposure profile of the
corrected time-series which is useful for masking out time-bins below a
certain threshold.  Light-curves for 2RE Catalogue sources did not use
data points calculated from exposures of less than 30 seconds (see
McGale \etal, MNRAS, in press).
\end{description}

\section{\label{se_shell_scripts}\xlabel{shell_scripts}{\tt csh} Scripts}

Some of the REPACK programs have been incorporated into {\tt csh}
scripts to perform some typical procedures and so minimise user interaction. 
These scripts are listed in the table below.

\begin{verbatim}
   Name        Description
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   re_light    Produces exposure correct background subtracted time-series.
   re_spec     Produces exposure correct background subtracted spectra.
   re_fitmrgsh Merge all event files, or a selection, in the current directory.
   re_menu     Menu driven ROSAT WFC survey data analysis.
\end{verbatim}

\section{\label{se_ancilliary_files}\xlabel{ancilliary_files}Ancillary Survey Files}

In order for the REPACK software to function properly,  access to various
reservoir files is required.  These are listed in the table below.

\begin{verbatim}
File             Typ*   Description
---------------- ---    --------------------------------------------------
reskyexp_f1.fit   F     Sky exposure map for survey passband S1.
reskyexp_f2.fit   F     Sky exposure map for survey passband S2.
reexp_eff.fit     F     Sky maps to allow for change in dectector efficiency.
re_slots.fit      F     WFC configuration during survey.
re_ateres.fit     F     WFC attitude solution during survey.
re_hkrres.fit     F     WFC housekeeping rates during survey.
re_psf_f1.sdf     H     Survey point spread function for passband S1.
re_psf_f2.sdf     H     Survey point spread function for passband S2.
re_imge.dat       A     Survey image list.

* F=FITS, H=HDS, A=ASCII
\end{verbatim}

The software startup procedure should define an environment variable
{\tt re\_res} that points to the location of these files.  ASTERIX
should also have been installed at the users site if the REPACK package
is to be used --- this gives access to the \ro WFC master calibration
file.  The user is never asked by the REPACK programs to supply any of
the above filenames as they work out for themselves which ones are
required.

\section{\label{se_contact_points}\xlabel{contact_points}Points of Contact}

The REPACK package was based on software written mostly by Mike Denby
to analyse \ro WFC survey data on VAXes.  The present software was
written by Paul McGale.  Points of contact are John Pye ({\tt
pye@star.le.ac.uk}) and Jeremy Ashley ({\tt jka@star.le.ac.uk}).

\section{\label{se_example_session}\xlabel{example_session}Example Session}

The following example shows how many of the REPACK programs and
procedures may be used.  It assumes that the user has already retrieved
survey event files from LEDAS (see Section~\ref{se_retrieving_images}) .

   RE_SPEC -- Version 110595
 
Please note that this version does not work with 
background derived from an annulus!   Background is got
from a circle offset along s/c scan path.  Recommended 
radii are 3am for source and 9am for background. 
A typical offset value maybe 20am. 
Moon times rejected. High background times NOT rejected.
 
 
   Give event file (eg mrgd_ev.fit): mrgd_ev
   Give source RA (deg\hms): 7.48
   Give source Dec (deg\hms): -63.41
   Give source name : mysrc
   Give source box radius (arcmin): 3
   Give bgnd offset (arcmin): 20
   Give bgnd box radius (arcmin): 9
 
The following will be created in the default directory
 
   mysrc_1_sp     - Background subtracted source spectrum
   mysrc_1_sp.pha - XSPEC (sf format) pha file
   mysrc_1_sp.rsp - XSPEC (sf format) rsp file
 
Files as above but for the S2A filter

The above shows one way of tackling \ro WFC survey data.  Another
approach, to cut down the number of processing steps, could have been to check 
the ROSWFCSI database for the image that surveyed the sky region of interest.  
This could then be retrieved instead of recreating it from the event files.  
Further, the 2RE catalogue could also have been searched to see if the desired
source had already been detected and if its light-curve existed.
