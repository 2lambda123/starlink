      SUBROUTINE CHT_FCREATE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CHT_FCREATE

*  Purpose:
*     Create a set of field centres

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CHT_FCREATE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Allows the user to enter a set of field centres which are stored
*     in a disk file for subsequent use by the catalogue searching
*     programs.  It is equivalent to the BATCH mode in the earlier
*     version of CHART.

*  Usage:
*     FCREATE {parameter_usage}

*  [ADAM_parameters]
*  [examples]
*  External Routines Used:
*     {facility_or_package}...

*  History:
*      5-JAN-1983 (KFH):
*        Original version.
*      9-DEC-1991 (PMA):
*        Changed call to CTOR to CHR_CTOR
*     10-DEC-1991 (PMA):
*        Changed from main program to subroutine to be an ADAM task
*     26-FEB-1993 (PMA):
*        Change the name of the routine to CHT_FCREATE.
*     2-MAR-1993 (AJJB):
*        STATUS argument added to CON_FACTOR call
*     4-MAR-1993 (Andrew Broderick (AJJB)):
*        STATUS argument added to all calls to routines within Chart
*        which did'nt already have one.
*     22-MAR-1993 (AJJB):
*        Replaced OPEN statements, with calls to
*        a new routine, FILEOPEN, which was found to be necessary when
*        porting, as the CARRIAGECONTROL specifier is used which is 
*        necessary on the Vax but unsupported on the Sun machines, so
*        that we can just have a different version of FILEOPEN for the
*        different machines to take care of this.
*     23-APR-1993 (AJJB):
*        Removed the adding of '.dat' to filenames.
*     26-APR-1993 (AJJB):
*        Took bits out which change filename which user enters to
*        uppercase and strips off extension.
*     26-APR-1993 (AJJB):
*        If the user has just entered a carriage return, exit from
*        the loop.
*     27-APR-1993 (AJJB):
*        Added calls to ERR_FLUSH at points where an invalid value has
*        been entered by user, so that STATUS gets restored to OK value
*        before prompting user again for value, as it was getting into
*        infinite loops.
*     12-MAY-1993 (AJJB):
*        Changed the bit that gets the filename from the user and opens
*        the file: it now prompts for the filename, and if the file
*        doesn't already exist it, it opens it with STATUS = 'NEW'. If
*        it does exist, it asks the user if he/she wants to add to the
*        existing file. If they answer yes, it OPENs it with STATUS =
*        'OLD', and if they answer no it loops back to the start for
*        another filename.
*     7-JUN-1993 (AJJB):
*        Commented out unused local variables REPLY and L
