      SUBROUTINE GSOUT( STATUS )
*
*   This subroutine provides an alternative way of creating
*   formatted output.
*
*   In this cas the output includes information about the stars
*   found relating to their use as Guide Stars for the RGO
*   astrometric refractors.
*
*   It is an adaption of subroutine STARS in the ICL1903T version
*   of Chart.
*
*   It was adapted by K F Hartley at RGO on 1-2-83
*
*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*   History:

*   Adapted by R W Argyle at RGO on 26-1-84 to include guide star
*   coordinates for the LPO 1 metre camera
*     3-MAR-1993 (AJJB):
*       STATUS argument added.
*     5-MAR-1993 (Andrew Broderick (AJJB)):
*        STATUS argument added to all calls to routines within Chart
*        which did'nt already have one.
*        
      INCLUDE 'SAE_PAR'          ! Standard SAE constants

*  Status:
