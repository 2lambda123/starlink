      SUBROUTINE SUB_SRCH(FILENAME, STATUS )

*  Name:
*     SUB_SRCH

*  Purpose:
C      This program reads the current parameter values and searches
C      the specified catalogues for all the stars within the
C      selected area, subject to any selection criteria which have been
C      laid down.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUB_SRCH( FILENAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
C      The subroutines called are all minor modifications of
C      those in the earlier version of CHART, written by P B Taylor.
C      They in turn were derived from earlier work by Roger Wood
C      and Bill Nicholson, all at RGO. Several other people at RGO
C      also worked on various aspects of these programs at various
C      times.

*  Arguments:
*     FILENAME = CHARACTER * ( 55 ) (Given)
*        {argument_description}
*     [argument_spec]...
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     11-1-83 (K F Hartley):
*        Original version.
*     23-FEB-1993 (AJJB):
*        Conversion to ADAM.
*     2-MAR-1993 (AJJB):
*        STATUS argument added to CONST call
*     5-MAR-1993 (Andrew Broderick (AJJB)):
*        STATUS argument added to all calls to routines within Chart
*        which did'nt already have one.
*     22-MAR-1993 (AJJB):
*        Replaced OPEN statement, with a call to
*        a new routine, FILEOPEN, which was found to be necessary when
*        porting, as the READONLY specifier is used which is 
*        necessary on the Vax but unsupported on the Sun machines, so
*        that we can just have a different version of FILEOPEN for the
*        different machines to take care of this.
*     21-APR-1993 (AJJB):
*        Changed STATUS specifier in OPEN statement which opens
*        chartint.dat from NEW to UNKNOWN, so that on Unix machines if
*        chartint.dat already exists it will use the existing version
*        instead of just complaining about it, and if it doesn't it will
*        create a new one.
