C         SUBROUTINE ELLIPSE 
C
C
C         This  routine  generates  a  set  of  (x,y)  co-ordinates   which 
C         represent  an  ellipse  at  any angle. The output is suitable for 
C         plotting by any polyline routine.

C         A           REAL  IN    This is the size of the longest  diameter 
C                                 of the ellipse. 
C
C         B           REAL  IN    This is the size of the shortest diameter 
C                                 of the ellipse. 
C
C         PA          REAL  IN    This is the position angle of  the  major 
C                                 axis in degrees.

C                                 contains the x co-ordinates whi have been 
C                                 generated.

C         Y           REAL  OUT   This is the array (of dimension N)  which 
C                                 contains the y co-ordinates whi have been 
C                                 generated. 
C
C         N           INT   IN    This defines the number of points  to  be 
C                                 generated.
