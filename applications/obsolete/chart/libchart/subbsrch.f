      SUBROUTINE SUB_BSRCH ( FILENAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SUB_BSRCH

*  Purpose:
*     This program reads the current parameter values and searches
*     the specified catalogues for all the stars within the
*     selected area, subject to any selection criteria which have been
*     laid down.


*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SUB_BSRCH( FILENAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
C
C      This program reads the current parameter values and searches
C      the specified catalogues for all the stars within the
C      selected area, subject to any selection criteria which have been
C      laid down.
C
C      The subroutines called are all minor modifications of
C      those in the earlier version of CHART, written by P B Taylor.
C      They in turn were derived from earlier work by Roger Wood
C      and Bill Nicholson, all at RGO. Several other people at RGO
C      also worked on various aspects of these programs at various
C      times.
C
C      The source code for this routine was lost some time prior to
C      October 1984. The code has been reconstructed by Peter Allan.
C      It is believed to be correct, but is is hard to be sure about
C      this. In fact, the reconstructed code is the same as that of
C      SUB_SRCH, except that the actual argument of SELECT is 'BAND'
C      instead of 'NORMAL'.

*  Arguments:
*     FILENAME = CHARACTER * ( 55 ) (Given)
*        {argument_description}
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     11-1-83 (K F Hartley):
*        Original version.
*     18-FEB-1993 (AJJB):
*        Conversion to ADAM
*     2-MAR-1993 (AJJB):
*        STATUS argument added to CONST call
*     22-MAR-1993 (AJJB):
*        Replaced OPEN statement, with a call to
*        a new routine, FILEOPEN, which was found to be necessary when
*        porting, as the READONLY specifier is used which is 
*        necessary on the Vax but unsupported on the Sun machines, so
*        that we can just have a different version of FILEOPEN for the
*        different machines to take care of this.
*     21-APR-1993 (AJJB):
*        Changed STATUS specifier in OPEN statement which opens
*        chartint.dat from NEW to UNKNOWN, so that on Unix machines if
*        chartint.dat already exists it will use the existing version
*        instead of just complaining about it, and if it doesn't it will
*        create a new one.
