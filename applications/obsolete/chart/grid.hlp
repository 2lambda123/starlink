 The answer determines whether an RA, Dec coordinate grid will be
 plotted along with the stars found.

 A string starting with Y or y will be stored as YES;

 a string starting with M or m will plot an abbreviated (or MINI)
 grid, giving RA/DEC markers, but no grid lines;

 anything else will be stored as NO.
