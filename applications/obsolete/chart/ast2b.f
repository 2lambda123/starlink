      PROGRAM AST2B

*
* A program which converts an ASCII version of the star catalog in 
* ASTROM format, as output by AST2A, back into it's original binary
* format. 
*     AST2A and this program, AST2B, are intended to make possible the
* porting of ASTROM format star catalog files between systems, by 
* converting the file into ASCII to make it portable, and back to binary
* on the target machine.
*
* The program will ask the user which machine it is running on, first,
* to be able to select the right record length for the RECL specifier 
* of the OPEN statement, as the VAX expects it in longwords for 
* unformatted files. It will then prompt the user for the pathnames 
* for both the existing ASTROM ASCII file and the binary file which is 
* to be output.
* 
* It's all standard FORTRAN 77, and uses no external or internal
* subroutines.
