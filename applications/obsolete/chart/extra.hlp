0 EXTRA

 Do you wish to plot any extra (ie user supplied) objects? If so,
 where are their positions stored?

 Options are:-    NONE          no such objects
                  name          a file called name.DAT

 Note that a list of objects may be created by using ECREATE when the
 default file name will be EXTRA.DAT
