0 FACTOR

 This is a re-scaling factor which may be used in conjunction with the
 RATIO parameter to ensure that the distorted chart is finally
 produced to the correct scale on the hard-copy device.

 In effect the selected SCALE value is multiplied by this FACTOR so
 that the user can continue to think in terms of the final output
 scale.
