0 XPROG

 This is the measured X co-ordinate of a star position.

 It should be entered as a floating point number; no default is
 allowed.   Hitting <CR> will cause an exit from this loop and return
 you to the XorR option.

 The X coordinate should run approximately east-west.  (If this is not
 the case, see SUN/5 note 12 for the consequences.)
