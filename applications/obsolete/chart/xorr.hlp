0 XORR

 This asks the user to specify whether the next series of
 positions to be entered are to be X,Y (for conversion to
 RA, Dec) or RA, Dec (for conversion to X,Y).

 In either case NAMEs may be specified optionally.

 A response of X will cause the program to prompt for X,Y positions

 A response of R (or anything NOT starting with X) will cause the
 program to prompt for positions specified by RA,DEC,EQUINOX

 A null response (hitting <CR>) forces exit from ASTRO.
