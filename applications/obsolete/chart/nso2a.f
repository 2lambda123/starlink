      PROGRAM NSO2A

*
* A program to convert star catalogs in NSO format from binary to
* ASCII format, to enable them to be ported from one system to another.
* There is, as you might expect, an equal and opposite program which 
* converts the ASCII format catalog back to binary format once it has
* been ported, called NSO2B.
*
* The program will ask the user which machine it is running on, first,
* to be able to select the right record length for the RECL specifier 
* of the OPEN statement, as the VAX expects it in longwords for 
* unformatted files. It will then prompt the user for the pathnames 
* for both the existing ASTROM binary file and the text file which is 
* to be output.
* Warning: the text files get pretty big - about 12 Mbytes.
* 
* It's all standard FORTRAN 77, and uses no external or internal
* subroutines.
