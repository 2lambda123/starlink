Notes on the test images
========================


cat320421.sdf
-------------

Has AST WCS info, but a slightly corrupt FITS extension (a SKEW card
has two values in it).  No important defects.  One very bright source
near the edge.

   Shape:
      No. of dimensions:  2
      Dimension size(s):  353 x 353
      Pixel bounds     :  1:353, 1:353
      Total pixels     :  124609

WCS info seems odd.  There's an AXIS frame, which reports the first
pixel centre as being at (261.8786, 74.4498), which appears to be a
duplicate of the axis _attributes_ (is that what the AXIS domain
means, I forget?), but the SKY frame has the first pixel centre at
(9:13:04.5, 29:20:23).  Neither shows up in Gaia in the ra-dec boxes,
but you _can_ plot the coordinate grid (and it's quite skew); from
that plot, the centre appears to be at about (9:13:00, 28:50:00).


r106280.sdf
-----------

   Shape:
      No. of dimensions:  2
      Dimension size(s):  2048 x 4097
      Pixel bounds     :  1:2048, 1:4097
      Total pixels     :  8390656

Centre at (17:27:09.533, 74:20:07.88)

Has AST WCS info (grid, pixel, axis, sky domains).  No important
defects, but several heavily overexposed sources, with horizontal
trails.

The WCS information corresponding to this (obtained by using
autoastrom with `--obsdata=ra=17:27:09.533,dec=74:20:07.88,scale=0.33
--match=match') is in r106280-wcs.sdf



r106281.sdf
-----------

Same size and shape.  No SKY frame, but four extra frames (domains:
CCD_WCSEDIT, UNDISTORT, MOS1, CCD_REG), added by WCSEDIT and REGISTER.

Sparse line of defects along edge x=1; a few overexposed sources,
including one which has a trail vertically across half the CCD.


r106282.sdf
-----------

Same set of frames as above.

Substantial background, higher at the bottom than at the top; some
overexposed sources.  Defects galore: a triangle in the bottom left,
rows of single-pixel defects around x=357, 465, 1229 (monster), 1245,
and a wierd splodge at (1245, 2829).


r106283.sdf
-----------

Same set of frames.  No monster defects, but a few overexposed objects
with long vertical trails.


south.sdf
---------

   Shape:
      No. of dimensions:  2
      Dimension size(s):  353 x 353
      Pixel bounds     :  1:353, 1:353
      Total pixels     :  124609

First pixel centre at (10:00:23.1, -30:05:00)

WCS info: GRID, PIXEL, AXIS and SKY frames (and the AXIS and SKY
frames appear to agree).  Southern hemisphere.  Not many defects;
highish background.  Odd FITS card: SKEW, with two values, as for
cat320421.sdf.
