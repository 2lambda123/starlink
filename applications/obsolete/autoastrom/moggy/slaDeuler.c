/* Small fragments of code to make up for the mildly filleted version
   of SkyCat libcat which this program uses.

   SkyCat's libcat (confusingly distinct from Starlink's libcat!) includes
   both some of Mark Calabretta's WCS code (wcslib) and some of Pat Wallace's
   SLALIB code, however these conflict with code included in Starlink
   libast_wcslib and libast_slalib.

   No problem: I can create a custom SkyCat libcat without the
   problematic code and link against that (see ../makefile).  That
   fails, however, because of the way that wcslib and slalib have been
   integrated into these particular AST glue libraries.

   Code within SkyCat refers to a function slaDeuler, which
   presumably maps to sla_deuler, but that function is omitted from
   AST's sla.c.  We define void slaDeuler here, patterned after the
   functions in AST's sla.c.  The prototype of slaDeuler is from
   catlib/astrotcl/wcslib/src/slasubs.c.  The only difference is that
   AST:sla.c declares the rotation matrices as `double rmat[3][3]',
   whereas catlib:slasubs.c declares them as `double (*rmat)[3]'.
   These are equivalent, since the first is equivalent to `rmat[][3]',
   which is in turn equivalent to the second form (cf. K&R Sect.5.7).
