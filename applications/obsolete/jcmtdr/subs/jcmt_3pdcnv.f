*  The data should contain NO information at the spatial frequency of the 
*  half beam-throw (distance between -ve spike and central spike) or its 
*  harmonics. Any signal that is there must be noise. This can be removed 
*  in the Fourier domain by multiplying the signal by a function with zeroes 
*  at the frequencies of zero sensitivity and 1 everywhere else. The same 
*  effect is achieved by convolving the inverse FT of this with the map 
*  data. This is NOD2's `symmetric function'. JCMT_GENSYCONFN generates the 
*  required function.

      RNORM = 1.0
      CALL JCMT_GENSYCONFN (BSEP/2.0d0, XINC, NX, NCFN, CFUNC)

*  do the convolution row by row

      DO IY = 1, NY

     :      FBAD, RNORM, BUFF, STATUS)

*  Now perform the deconvolution. This could be done by dividing the FT of the
*  map by the FT of the beam chop, and calculating the inverse FT to give the
*  desired result. The equivalent is achieved by convolving the map data
*  with the function whose FT is as close as possible to 1 over the FT of
*  the chop function itself. This is the `asymmetric function' used in NOD2
*  and JCMT_3POS_CONFN calculates it for the 3-position chop
