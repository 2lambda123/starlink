 Version 1.2 of JCMTDR for Unix.


 Since the previous version (1.1), GSD support has been added.

  o GSD files can be converted with "makemap" into NDF format for (i)
    further use in JCMTDR, (ii) use in Figaro, (iii) use in Kappa and
    associated packages.

  o GSD files can be inspected with "gsd_print". The name of the GSD
    file must be given as first argument. Output is on standard output,
    it can be re-directed to a file or piped into other commands like
    "more".
    The exact format of gsd_print is changed compared to the VAX
    version.

 GSD files must be specified by full name, including the file name
 extension (usually .DAT or .dat).

 GSD files can be taken across from the VAX/VMS system to the Unix
 system either by ftp transfer in binary mode, or with the Unix "cp"
 command if the VAX file system is mounted by the Unix machine.


 A further change is in "ae2rd1" and "ae2rd2". The parameter INFILE is
 now prompted with blank default for the first file and with default
 'END' for any further files.


 Starlink User Note 132 is available on-line as Web pages. The browser
 for these pages can be started with "jcmt_xhelp" from the Unix shell.
