#  Name:
#     makefile
#
#  Purpose:
#     Make file for an application package.
#
#  Invocation:
#     This makefile is not intended to be used by make when invoked directly
#     (although this is possible), but instead to be used via the accompanying
#     mk script. This script sets up a number of environment variables which
#     are used as macros within the makefile and which accommodate differences
#     between machines and operating systems (it invokes make with the -e
#     option). Please consult the mk script prologue for full details.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     Description file for the UNIX "make" command.
#
#  Description:
#     This description file is used by the UNIX "make" command to build an
#     application package from the released source files and to install the
#     resulting system for use.
#
#  Targets:
#        The targets check, build, clean and unbuild are largely delegated to a
#        number of subsidiary make files each in it own subdirectory and
#        responsible for one object library.  The targets export_source and
#        export are achieved partly by repeatedly invoking make in the current
#        working directory, but with the subsidiary make files xxx/makefile,
#        which hold the lists of source and built files for the respective
#        object libraries.
#     make [help]
#        This is the default target.  It outputs a message describing the mk
#        script and listing the targets provided.
#     make check
#        Performs a simple check that all necessary source files are present.
#     make build
#        Compiles the source files and creates all files needed prior to
#        installing the sytem for use.
#     make clean
#        Cleans up after building the package, removing intermediate files
#        created during the building process.
#     make unbuild
#        Reverses the building process, removing all built files and all
#        intermediate files.
#     make export
#        Produces an export copy of the built (but not installed) system. A
#        cpoompressed tar file is created in the $EXPORT directory containing
#        the files that comprise the built system. The current directory is
#        used by default if the environment variable EXPORT is not defined.
#        After unpacking the exported file on a similar machine, the recipient
#        may simply install it for use.
#     make export_run
#        Produces an export copy of the built package suitable for
#        passing to another user.  A compressed tar file is created
#        in the $EXPORT directory containing copies of the built 
#        files for the package (the current directory is used by 
#        default if the environment variable EXPORT is not defined).
#        The package should normally be built, installed and tested 
#        (see above) before using this target.  After unpacking the
#        exported file on a similar machine, the recipient may simply
#        install it for use. [this is the bare-bones release]
#     make export_source
#        Produces an export copy of the source for the system suitable for
#        passing to another user to build (possibly on on a different type of
#        machine).  A compressed tar file is created in the $EXPORT directory
#        containing the files necessary to build the system (the current
#        directory is used by default if the environment variable EXPORT is not
#        defined).  After unpacking the exported file, the recipient must build
#        the system before installing it for use.
#     make install
#        Installs the package for use by putting the necessary files into
#        sub-directories (bin and help, by default) of the $INSTALL directory
#        (the $HOME directory is used if the environment variable INSTALL is
#        not defined).
#     make deinstall
#        Reverses the action of the install target, removing files from
#        sub-directories of the $INSTALL directory and restoring them to the
#        source directory (the $HOME directory is used by default if the
#        environment variable INSTALL is not defined).
#     make test
#        Instruct the user on how to perform a test of the package.
#
#  Sequences of targets:
#     The code can be in one of three states, unbuilt, built, and installed.
#     The code is unbuilt if and only if .BUILT is absent and .INSTALLED is
#     absent. The code is built if and only if .BUILT exists and .INSTALLED is
#     absent. The code is installed if and only if .BUILT exists and .INSTALLED
#     exists.
#
#     For unbuilt code the behaviour should be:
#      + clean succeeds, but has no effect.
#      + build succeeds, transition to built state.
#      + unbuild succeeds, but has no effect.
#      + install fails due to absence of .BUILT.
#      + deinstall fails due to absence of .INSTALLED.
#      + export_source succeeds.
#      + export fails due to absence of .BUILT.
#
#     For built code the behaviour should be:
#      + clean succeeds.
#      + build succeeds, but has no significant effect (creates include links
#        and a new DATE_STAMP, may also randomise libraries and re-link
#        monolith for nfs-mounted file systems and un-synchronised clocks).
#      + unbuild succeeds, transition to unbuilt state.
#      + install succeeds, transition to installed state.
#      + deinstall fails due to absence of .INSTALLED
#      + export_source succeeds.
#      + export succeeds.
#
#     For installed code the behaviour should be:
#      + clean succeeds.
#      + build fails due to existence of .INSTALLED.
#      + unbuild fails due to to existence of .INSTALLED.
#      + install fails due to to existence of .INSTALLED.
#      + deinstall succeeds, transition to built state.
#      + export_source succeeds.
#      + export succeeds.
#
#     DATE_STAMP reflects the environment settings for the last successful
#     build. In order that it is correct, build from the source-only
#     distribution all in one go.
#
#  Prior Requirements:
#     This makefile uses a number of macros to allow it to be configured for
#     different computer systems and file organisations.  These macros all have
#     defaults but, in general, specific values should be assigned to over-ride
#     at least some of these.  As a minimum, the SYSTEM macro should be defined
#     externally (e.g. by defining an environment variable and invoking "make"
#     with the "-e" option) in order to identify the computer system in use.
#     The associated C- shell script "mk" is provided to make the necessary
#     external definitions and to invoke "make" for currently supported SYSTEM
#     values.
#
#  External Dependencies:
#     This package depends on the following external files and systems which
#     must previously have been installed in the appropriate directories (by
#     default these should be sub-directories of the $STARLINK directory; /star
#     is used if the environment variable STARLINK is not defined).

#  History:
#     05 Jul 1994 (hme):
#        Original Version
#     11 Oct 1994 (hme):
#        Change export and export_source so that all makefiles gather a single
#        file list, which then is used in a single tar command. The motivation
#        is that "tar r" does not work on Solaris.
#     28 Nov 1994 (hme):
#        IRA library was moved to /star/iras90 from the ./lib below.
#        Add the GSD library.
#     12 Jan 1995 (hme):
#        Add HTML directory.
#     29 Mar 2003 (timj):
#        Remove HTML directory. Distribute .htx_tar files and include
#        Latex documents (inc SC/1). Add Licence file.
#     28 May 2003 (timj):
#        Add export_run target. Switch to $COMPRESS and $COMPSFX
#     {note_further_changes_here}

#  Macro defaults.

TAR_IN = pax -w -v -x ustar -f

#  Name of the package and the package version number.
