 Version 1.2 of JCMTDR for Unix.
<p>
 Since the previous version (1.1), GSD support has been added.
<ul>
<li>GSD files can be converted with ``makemap'' into NDF format for (i)
    further use in JCMTDR, (ii) use in Figaro, (iii) use in Kappa and
    associated packages.

<li>GSD files can be inspected with ``gsd_print''. The name of the GSD
    file must be given as first argument. Output is on standard output,
    it can be re-directed to a file or piped into other commands like
    ``more''.<br>
    The exact format of gsd_print is changed compared to the VAX
    version.
</ul>
 GSD files must be specified by full name, including the file name
 extension (usually .DAT or .dat).
<p>
 GSD files can be taken across from the VAX/VMS system to the Unix
 system either by ftp transfer in binary mode, or with the Unix ``cp''
 command if the VAX file system is mounted by the Unix machine.
<p>

 A further change is in ``ae2rd1'' and ``ae2rd2''. The parameter INFILE is
 now prompted with blank default for the first file and with default
 `END' for any further files.
<p>

 Starlink User Note 132 is available on-line as Web pages. The browser
 for these pages can be started with ``jcmt_xhelp'' from the Unix shell.
