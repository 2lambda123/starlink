This application converts an image into a `time spectrum' with the map
pixels sorted in order of increasing LST of observation. The LST is
stored as  the X axis. It is useful to have the data in this form if
you want to spot and correct variations in the data that are functions
of time. The data will have to be transformed back into map format
using
<a href=ts2map.html>TS2MAP</a>
before being input to other JCMTDR applications.

The application has the following parameters:
<pre>
