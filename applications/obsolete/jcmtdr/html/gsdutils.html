On VMS two utilities are provided to allow examination and  modification of
the raw GSD data files. On Unix only an examination utility is
available.
The utilities are available as DCL symbols (shell commands) and should
be prefaced by a $ when run from VAX/ICL.

<h2>GSD_PRINT</h2>

This reads the contents of a GSD file and writes them to an ASCII file
suitable for printing or examining with an editor.

<h2>GSD_FORMAT</h2>

This is used to display individual, named items in the GSD file and
can modify their values. The program operates in a loop which can be
exited by responding to a prompt with CTRL-C. This utility is not
available in the Unix version.
