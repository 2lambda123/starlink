This application deconvolves the chopped-beam from a JCMT dual  beam
map of a source in a manner similar to that described by  Emerson,
Klein &amp Haslam (Astron. Astrophys., 76, 92). The algorithm  is exactly
the same as that used in NOD2; first the spatial  frequencies to which
the chop is insensitive are set to zero,  then the chop is
deconvolved. The map is deconvolved scan by scan.
<p>
The source will come out negative if the positive beam of the chopper
was specified wrongly in
<a href=makemap.html>MAKEMAP</a>.
This can be fixed by using LET (on
VMS) or SETOBJ (on Unix) to
set <em>file</em>.MORE.JCMT.MAP.POS_BEAM to the correct value and
re-running RESTORE. Similarly, the chop throw  is read from
<em>file</em>.MORE.JCMT.MAP.CHOP_THRW and can be changed if you  believe that
the nominal value was inaccurate.
<p>
If there are any bad pixels in the input data they will be ignored,
effectively treated as zero in the restoration process. If the pixel
is in the source then this is <em>not what you want to happen.</em> The
pixel should be set to something nearer to its real value by using one
of the Figaro data editing applications. Similarly  the process
carries the implicit assumption that all data points outside the raw
map would have been zero had they been measured. Bad results will be
obtained if the raw map does not extend right off the source in the
scan direction. Lastly, the zero level in the raw map must be set to 0
before RESTORE is run, often the raw data has a DC offset.

The parameters used are:
<pre>
PARAMETER  INPUT
   TYPE    FILE
   NAME    IN(PUT)
   OPTIONS INPUT
   PROMPT  "(INput) file containing map data"

PARAMETER  OUTPUT
   TYPE    FILE
   NAME    OUT(PUT)
   OPTIONS OUTPUT
   PROMPT  "(OUTput) file to contain restored map"

PARAMETER  UNBAL
   TYPE    FLOAT
   NAME    UNBAL
   OPTIONS NOPROMPT
   PROMPT  "(UNBAL) amplitude (L beam) / amplitude (R beam)"
   TEXT    ------------------------------------------------------
           The ratio of the amplitude of the left hand chop beam
           and that of the right hand chop beam. For the JCMT this
           will normally be 1.
