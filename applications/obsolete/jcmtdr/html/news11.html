</ul>

 This is the Port of JCMTDR 1.0 to Unix. Note the following differences
 in the Unix version:
<p>
<ul>
<li>So far it is common to run the commands from the Unix shell. To start
   up JCMTDR from the shell you need to:
<pre>
      source /star/etc/cshrc in your .chsrc
      source /star/etc/login in your .login
</pre>
   Then the command:
<pre>
      % jcmtdr
</pre
   will define all the commands of the JCMTDR package.
<p>

<li>On-line help is available, from the Unix shell use ``jcmt_help''.
<p>

<li>GSD format is currently not supported. Thus MAKEMAP, GSD_PRINT and
   GSD_FORMAT are not available. You will have to process GSD data on a
   VAX with JCMTDR 1.0.
<p>

<li>JCMTDR data are in Figaro/NDF format and can be transferred as binary
   files between VMS and various Unix flavours. It is not necessary to
   process the files. However, you might run the ``native'' command from
   the Kappa package on the files on the destination machine. This may
   save some time in further access to the file.
</ul>
