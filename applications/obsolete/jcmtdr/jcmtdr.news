1 JCMTDR - Applications for reducing JCMT GSD on-the-fly data
                                                      Expires: ????.??.??

 This is release V1.2-3 of JCMTDR. This is the first release for
 Linux and the first without reliance on the NAG library.

 JCMTDR is a collection of applications for use in reducing JCMT
 mapping data taken using the IFD in conjunction with UKT14 or the
 single-pixel heterodyne frontends. It is intended as a replacement
 for NOD2. This programme is intended for reduction of archive data
 and of heterodyne beam maps.

 For processing of SCUBA data use SURF (see SUN/216).

2 New_in_version_1.2-3

  o  Build system changed to use Gnu autoconf.

  o  Now links against Figaro fda library rather than dsa/dta for
     file access.

2 New_in_version_1.2-2

  o  This involved the replacement of all NAG routines with
     routines from the PDA library (see SUN/194). AE2RD2 has been removed
     as no replacement PDA routine is available.

  o  Include SC/1 and SUN/132 in the distribution. Update SUN/132 to current
     standard although references to VMS and old Figaro support are still
     present and should be removed.

  o  GSD inspection routines have been removed. They are now distributed as
     part of the separate GSD package (see SUN/229).

  o  The jcmt_xhelp command has been replaced with the standard Starlink
     HTML access system ('findme sun132').

2 New_in_version_1.2

 Since the previous version (1.1), GSD support has been added.

  o GSD files can be converted with "makemap" into NDF format for (i)
    further use in JCMTDR, (ii) use in Figaro, (iii) use in Kappa and
    associated packages.

  o GSD files can be inspected with "gsd_print". The name of the GSD
    file must be given as first argument. Output is on standard output,
    it can be re-directed to a file or piped into other commands like
    "more".
    The exact format of gsd_print is changed compared to the VAX
    version.

 GSD files must be specified by full name, including the file name
 extension (usually .DAT or .dat).

 GSD files can be taken across from the VAX/VMS system to the Unix
 system either by ftp transfer in binary mode, or with the Unix "cp"
 command if the VAX file system is mounted by the Unix machine.


 A further change is in "ae2rd1" and "ae2rd2". The parameter INFILE is
 now prompted with blank default for the first file and with default
 'END' for any further files.


 Starlink User Note 132 is available on-line as Web pages. The browser
 for these pages can be started with "jcmt_xhelp" from the Unix shell.
