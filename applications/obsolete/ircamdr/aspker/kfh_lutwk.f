*+  KFH_LUTWK - Routine for user to adjust args lookup table.
      SUBROUTINE KFH_LUTWK(LUT,MXLUTS,TABLE,STATUS)
*    Description :
*     This routine controls the adjustment of the ARGS lookup
*     table when the user moves the trackerball and presses
*     the buttons. The trackerball controls two aspects of
*     the lookup table. First the motion in the x-direction
*     shifts the origin of the colour set relative to that
*     of the pens. If the colour set is to the right of the
*     the start of the pens then all the pens up to the
*     beginning of the colour set are given the value of the
*     first element of the colour set. Should the colour set
*     begin to the left of the lookup table then the section
*     that 'overhangs' is just ignored. Equally if the colour
*     set 'overhangs' at the right-hand end the extra is just
*     ignored.
*      The second aspect that can be changed is how many pens
*     the colour set is to be distributed over. The pens in
*     the given range are allocated the nearest value from the
*     colour set.
*      The buttons on the trackerball box do the following :
*      Green - Sets the two tables so that they start at the
*              same position, and have the same length.
*      White - Advances the program onto the next colour set
*              causing it to start again at the first one
*              when the end has been reached.
*      White - Not used.
*      Red   - Causes the lookup table to be rewritten using
*            - GKS rather than the usual ARGS-specific routine
*              and then closes SGS and returns control to the
*              main program (i.e. TWEAK, NOT SAI_MAIN).
*    Invocation :
*     CALL KFH_LUTWK(LUT,MXLUTS,TABLE,STATUS)
*    Parameters :
*     LUT(3,0:255,NLUTS) = _INTEGER	! Colour set array.
*     MXLUTS = _INTEGER			! Maximum number of
*					! available colour
*					! sets.
*     TABLE(3,0:255) = _INTEGER		! Lookup table.
*     STATUS = _INTEGER			! Status.
*    Method :
*     Firstly three predefined standard colour sets are defined
*     and stored in LUT. These are :
*      1) The greyscale ramp.
*      2) The colour ramps.
*      3) The colour blocks.
*     The greyscale is loaded into the ARGS lookup table to
*     begin with. The trackerball box is then continuously
*     monitored and the lookup table adjusted according to
*     what the user enters.
*      If the trackerball is rotated in the x-directon the
*     new offset is calculated from:
*     OFFSET = PREVIOUS OFFSET + ( X - PREVIOUS X ) * 1/2
*     The factor of 1/2 was chosen so that the offset goes
*     from pen zero to pen 255 for a sweep of the cursor
*     from the left hand side of the screen to the right
*     hand side.
*      The range of pens of pens in which the colour set
*     is fitted is changed when the ball is changed when the
*     trackerball is moved in the y-direction according to :
*     RANGE = PREVIOUS RANGE + ( Y - PREVIOUS Y ) * 1/2
*     The factor of 1/2 was chosen so that the colour set is
*     to ranges of 256 pens to zero pens when the cursor moves
*     from the top of the screen to the bottom.
*     When fitting the colour set to the pens the compression
*     is carried out using the equaton :
*     PEN = OFFSET + [ RANGE * COLOUR NUMBER / 255 ]
*    Deficiencies :
*     The known deficiencies are :
*      1) The call to SGS_ASSOC will clear the ARGS.
*      2) SRCOLS has to be used to load the ARGS lookup table
*         instead of a GKS/SGS routine as it is so much faster.
