*+  KFH_LINSET - Calculates the X,Y positions of points 
*                ready for interpolation.
      SUBROUTINE KFH_LINSET(X1,Y1,X2,Y2,LINDAT,NPTS)                                
*    Description :
*     This routine calculates the X,Y positions of points
*     at radii of integral pixel spacings from the first
*     point.
*    Invocation :
*     CALL KFH_LINSET(X1,Y1,X2,Y2,LINDAT,NPTS)
*    Parameters :
*     X1 = REAL
*           The X-coordinate of the first point from
*           which the slice will be taken.
*     Y1 = REAL
*           The Y-coordinate of the first point from
*           which the slice will be taken.
*     X2 = REAL
*           The X-coordinate of the second point to
*           which the slice will be taken.
*     Y2 = REAL
*           The Y-coordinate of the second point to
*           which the slice will be taken.
*     LINDAT(0:1023,2) = REAL
*           The array which will contain the X,Y 
*           positions of points.
*     NPTS = INTEGER
*           The number of points in the array.
*    Method :
*     The arc tangent of the difference between the
*     Y-coordinates divided by the difference between
*     the X-coordinates is calculated. The sine and
*     cosine of this result is then found. The X,Y
*     positions of points at radii of integral pixel.
*     spacings from the first point are then calculated
