*    Description :
*
*     This routine adds an image into a (usually larger) ouput image,
*     and is used in mosaicing arrays together. The offset of the 
*     small array relative to the large one is given. For each pixel
*     of the small array, the value of that pixel is added to the
*     input value of the corresponding pixel in the big array, but
*     in a weighted fashion according to the number of previous
*     additions to that pixel, as recorded in the mask array. If a
*     successful addition takes place for a particular pixel, the
*     corresponding pixel in the mask array is incremented by 1 to
*     record this fact.
*     This version of the subroutine takes care of bad pixels - a
*     number BAD_VALUE is passed. On looping through the input data, 
*     a is made check to see if the current input pixel is bad or not. 
*     If it is, then the data is not included in the mosaic. If not, 
*     then the valid data is added accordingly, the mask being updated.
*     Remembering that there will almost always be blank data positions 
*     in a mosaic, where none of the input arrays actually lie, then 
*     if no good data is found for a pixel that SHOULD have data, then
*     a bad pixel value is inserted in the output array at that position.
*     This procedure uses the mask array to check whether valid data has
*     been included at any point in the mosaic. If good data is found for
*     a point later, the bad value is deleted, and the good data inserted.
*
*    Invocation :
*
