*+  COMPRESSSUB - compresses an image by different amounts in x and y

      SUBROUTINE COMPRESSSUB ( INARRAY, IDIMS1, IDIMS2, OUTARRAY, 
     :                         ODIMS1, ODIMS2, XCMPRS, YCMPRS, 
     :                         STATUS )

*    Description :
*
*     This routine averages over a number of pixels in the input image
*     ( as defined by the two integer compression factors ), and creates
*     a smaller image containing the averaged pixels. This routine is
*     designed for 2-d arrays only.
*
*    Invocation :
*
*     CALL COMPRESSSUB( INARRAY, IDIMS, OUTARRAY, ODIMS, XCMPRS, 
*                       YCMPRS, STATUS )
*
*    Method :
*
*     The routine takes as input a data array and its dimensions,
*     and a new array with its dimensions. The compression factors
*     define the linear factors over which the input array is to
*     be averaged in each dimension to compress the input array
*     into the output array. Using a rolling array that equals the
*     length of the input array x dimension, each column in the
*     input is summed over the calculated number of rows, and then
*     the columns are summed over the calculated number of columns 
*     and divided by the total number of pixels that were summed over 
*     to form a row of output pixels. The rolling array is then re-
*     initialised and is used again to sum over the next set of
*     rows and so on, until all the rows of the output image have
*     been created.
*
*    Deficiencies :
*
*     Maximum input array x dimension is 2048, not adjustable.
*     
*    Bugs :
*
*     None known.

*    work out the size of box which we average over in the input 
*    image to create one new pixel in the output image - having used
*    integer arithmetic in to calculate the output dimensions from
*    the input dimensions and the compression factor, we can be
*    sure that an integer number of such boxes will fit into the
*    input array

      BOX  =  XCMPRS * YCMPRS

*    loop around all the output pixels - outer loop is in y dimension

      DO  J  =  1, ODIMS2

*       first re-initialise the row-summing array

         DO  N  =  1, IDIMS1
            ROW( N )  =  0.0
         END DO

*       calculate next start and end rows in  the input image which

         STARTROW  =  ( ( J - 1 ) * YCMPRS ) + 1      
         ENDROW    =  STARTROW + YCMPRS - 1

*       now loop round these rows and all the input columns to get
*       a new row compressed in the y direction but not x

         DO  L  =  STARTROW, ENDROW
            DO  K  =  1, IDIMS1

*          first re-initialise the running total

*          now work out the start and end columns in the input image
*          that go to make up the current output image column

            STARTCOL  =  ( ( I - 1 ) * XCMPRS ) + 1
