*+  ROTAS3 - calculates size of rotation box etc. for ROTATE
      SUBROUTINE ROTAS3( DIMS, SQRMAX, XLARGE, ROTSIZ, LONG, SHORT,
     :  STATUS )
*    Description :
*     XLARGE is set to .true. if the first dimension of the input array
*     is greater than or equal to the second dimension of the input
*     array and LONG and SHORT are set equal to the longer dimension and
*     shorter dimension of the input array respectively. A value for the
*     size of the rotaton box, ROTSIZ, which is to be less than or equal
*     to the maximum allowed size, SQRMAX, is determined.
*     An immediate return will occur if STATUS has an error value on entry.
*    Invocation :
*     CALL ROTAS3( DIMS, SQRMAX, XLARGE, ROTSIZ, LONG, SHORT, STATUS )
*    Parameters :
*     DIMS( 2 ) = INTEGER( READ )
*           Dimensions of data array to be rotated.
*     SQRMAX = INTEGER( READ )
*           Maximum allowed size for ROTSIZ, the size of the sub-array to be
*           rotated.
*     XLARGE = LOGICAL( WRITE )
*           Set to .TRUE. if first dimension of input array is greater than
*           the second dimension.
*     ROTSIZ = INTEGER( WRITE )
*           Size of the subsections of the input array which will be rotated.
*     LONG = INTEGER( WRITE )
*           Longest dimension of the array to be rotated.
*     SHORT = INTEGER( WRITE )
*           Shortest dimension of the array to be rotated.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ )
*           This is the global status, if this variable has an error value on
*           entry then an immediate return will occur.
*    Method :
*     If no error on entry then
*        If first dimension of input array is greater than or equal to the
*          second dimension of the input array then
*           XLARGE is set to .true.
*           LONG is set equal to the first dimension of the input array
*           SHORT is set equal to the second dimension of the input array
*        Else
*           XLARGE is set to .false.
*           LONG is set equal to the second dimension of the input array
*           SHORT is set equal to the first dimension of the input array
*        Endif
*        Calculate the size of the rotation box
*        If SHORT is greater than the maximum allowed size for the
*          rotation box then
*           The smallest number of squares, NUMSQ, of side less than or 
*           equal to the maximum allowed size of the rotation box, which can
*           be fitted along the shortest side of the input array is calculated.
*           The size of the rotation box, ROTSIZ, is then given by dividing
*           SHORT by NUMSQ. If NUMSQ does not divide exactly into SHORT then
*           ROTSIZ is increased by one to ensure that all the data will be
*           included.
*        Else
*           The size of the rotation box, ROTSIZ, is set equal to SHORT.
*        Endif
