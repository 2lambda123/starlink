*+  RAPGAU - performs a rapid 2-D gaussian smooth on a 2-D array
      SUBROUTINE RAPGAU( SIGMA, NPIX, DIMS1, DIMS2, ARRAY, ROLL, RBUF, 
     :  WEIGHT, RMARGE, STATUS )
*    Description :
*     Replaces each pixel of the 2-D array, ARRAY, by the weighted mean of
*     the NPIX by NPIX pixels centred on it. NPIX must be odd. The weighting
*     function is a gaussian of standard deviation SIGMA pixels.
*     An immediate return will occur if STATUS has an error value on entry.
*    Invocation :
*      CALL RAPGAU( SIGMA, NPIX, DIMS, ARRAY, ROLL, RBUF, WEIGHT, RMARGE,
*     :  STATUS )
*    Parameters :
*     SIGMA = REAL( READ )
*           Standard deviation of the gaussian to be used for smoothing.
*     NPIX = INTEGER( READ )
*           Size, in pixels, of the box over which the gaussian smoothing
*           profile will be applied.
*     DIMS( 2 ) = INTEGER( READ )
*           Dimensions of the data array holding the data to be smoothed.
*     ARRAY( DIMS(1), DIMS(2) ) = REAL( UPDATE )
*           Array which contains data to be smoothed on entry and contains the
*           smoothed data on exit.
*     ROLL( DIMS(1), NPIX ) = REAL( WRITE )
*           Workspace for the 2-D rolling buffer.
*     RBUF( NPIX ) = REAL( WRITE )
*           Workspace for the 1-D rolling buffer.
*     WEIGHT( NPIX ) = REAL( WRITE )
*           Workspace for the gaussian weighting function.
*     RMARGE( DIMS(1) ) = REAL( WRITE )
*           Workspace for the marginal sum of ROLL.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*           This is the global status, if this variable has an error value on
*           entry then an immediate return will occur.
*    Method :
*     If no error on entry then
*        Initialize 2-D rolling buffer as the bottom part of the data array,
*        centred on the row 'below' the bottom of the data array, padded by
*        duplicating the bottom row of the array.
*        For each row of the data array
*           If clear of top edge
*              Update 2-D rolling buffer to contain the NPIX original data
*              rows centred on the current row.
*           Else
*              Update 2-D rolling buffer by replicating last row of data array
*           Endif
*           Put the column weighted means of the 2-D rolling buffer into a 1-D
*           array.
*           For each point along the current row
*              New value for point is the weighted mean of the NPIX column
*              weighted means centred on the current point.
*              If the current point is within NPIX/2 points of the start or end
*              of the row then the first or last column weighted mean for the
*              row is replicated.
*           Endfor
