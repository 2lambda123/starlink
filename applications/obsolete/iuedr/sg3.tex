%  Name:
%     SST.TEX

%  Purpose:
%     Define LaTeX commands for laying out Starlink routine descriptions.

%  Language:
%     LaTeX

%  Type of Module:
%     LaTeX data file.

%  Description:
%     This file defines LaTeX commands which allow routine documentation
%     produced by the SST application PROLAT to be processed by LaTeX and
%     by LaTeX2html. The contents of this file should be included in the
%     source prior to any statements that make of the sst commnds.

%  Notes:
%     The commands defined in the style file html.sty provided with LaTeX2html
%     are used. These should either be made available by using the appropriate
%     sun.tex (with hypertext extensions) or by putting the file html.sty
%     on your TEXINPUTS path (and including the name as part of the
%     documentstyle declaration).

%  Authors:
%     RFWS: R.F. Warren-Smith (STARLINK)
%     PDRAPER: P.W. Draper (Starlink - Durham University)

%  History:
%     10-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
%        Original version.
%     10-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
%        Added the implementation status section.
%     12-SEP-1990 (RFWS):

\section{\xlabel{introduction}\label{se:introduction}Introduction }
\markboth{Introduction}{\stardocname}

This manual describes the commands and parameters used by IUEDR\@.
It is intended as a reference aid for people using IUEDR\@.

If you are new to IUE data reduction, you may like to read
\xref{{\sl IUE Analysis
a Tutorial}}{sg7}{} (SG/7) and the
\xref{{\sl IUEDR User Guide}}{mud45}{} (MUD/45) before proceeding
any further.
The Starlink User Note \xref{SUN/37}{sun37}{} contains a general description
of IUEDR which
overlaps with the early sections of this manual and also contains any notes on
the most recent release of the program.

Commands are described in Section~\ref{se:commands}, with parameters described
in more detail in Section~\ref{se:parameters}\@.
A list of default parameter behaviour and values is given in
Appendix~\ref{se:parameter_defaults}\@.
Details of transferring old-style IUEDR files from VMS systems to UNIX systems
and the conversion process are given in Appendix~\ref{se:vmsunix}\@.

\begin{latexonly}
An index of both commands and parameters is given in Appendix~\ref{se:index}\@.
\end{latexonly}

IUEDR functions fall into a number of specific categories:

\begin {itemize}
   \item IUE GO tape or file inspection and reading.
   \item Data display and manipulation.
   \item Spectrum extraction and calibration.
   \item Extraction product inspection and manipulation.
   \item Extraction product output.
   \item General operational commands.
\end {itemize}

These functions are controlled by over fifty commands, with nearly one hundred
global parameters within IUEDR\@.
There follows a summary of the commands available in each of the categories
listed above.

\subsection {IUE GO tape or file inspection and reading}

\comdescenv{
   \comdesc{LISTIUE}{Analyse the contents of one or more IUE tape files.}
   \comdesc{MTMOVE}{Move to the start of a tape file.}
   \comdesc{MTREW}{Rewind to the start of the tape.}
   \comdesc{MTSHOW}{Show the current tape position.}
   \comdesc{MTSKIPEOV}{Skip over the end-of-volume mark.}
   \comdesc{MTSKIPF}{Skip over NSKIP tape marks.}
   \comdesc{READIUE}{Read a RAW, GPHOT or PHOT IUE image from the tape/file.}
   \comdesc{READSIPS}{Read the MELO or MEHI IUESIPS product from the tape/file.}
}

\subsection {Data display and manipulation}

\comdescenv{
   \comdesc{CULIMITS}{Delineate the graphical display limits using the
                      graphics cursor.}
   \comdesc{CURSOR}{Determine display coordinates using the graphics cursor}
           \comdescc{and print them at the terminal.}
   \comdesc{DRIMAGE}{Display an IUE image on a suitable graphics workstation.}
   \comdesc{EDIMAGE}{Edit the image data quality using the graphics cursor.}
   \comdesc{MODIMAGE}{Modify image pixel intensities interactively.}
   \comdesc{CLEAN}{Mark as `bad' pixels with value below a given threshold.}
   \comdesc{SHOW}{Print information relating to the current dataset at the
                  terminal.}
   \comdesc{ERASE}{Erase the display screen of the current graphics
                   workstation.}
}

Image displays are colour coded to provide data quality information.
The colour codes used by IUEDR are as follows:

\begin{latexonly}
\begin {quote}
\begin {description}
   \item [Green] pixels affected by reseau marks
   \item [Red] pixels which are saturated (DN=255)
   \item [Orange] pixels affected by ITF truncation
   \item [Yellow] pixels marked bad by the user
\end {description}
\end {quote}
\end{latexonly}

\begin{htmlonly}
\begin{rawhtml}
<PRE>
   <B>Green</B>  - pixels affected by reseau marks
   <B>Red</B>    - pixels which are saturated (DN=255)
   <B>Orange</B> - pixels affected by ITF truncation
   <B>Yellow</B> - pixels marked bad by the user
</PRE>
\end{rawhtml}
\end{htmlonly}

The colour {\bf Blue} is used to indicate a pixel which has a value above the
maximum that can be displayed using the linear greyscale image display colour
look-up table.

When using a mouse or tracker-ball with the graphics cursor, the cursor hit
buttons are normally numbered in increasing order from left to right.
For example the left mouse button corresponds to cursor key hit 1, middle
button to cursor key hit 2 and so on.
Many terminals allow left-handed users to reverse the mouse button order.

\subsection {Spectrum extraction and calibration}

\comdescenv{
   \comdesc{AESHIFT}{Determine (HIRES) spectrum ESHIFT automatically.}
   \comdesc{AGSHIFT}{Determine spectrum template shift automatically.}
   \comdesc{BARKER}{Correct the extracted data for \'{e}chelle ripple}
           \comdescc{using a method based upon that of Barker (1984).}
   \comdesc{CGSHIFT}{Determine spectrum template shift using the cursor
                     on a SCAN plot.}
   \comdesc{LBLS}{Extract a line-by-line-spectrum array from the image.}
   \comdesc{NEWABS}{Associate a new absolute flux calibration with the
                  current  dataset.}
   \comdesc{NEWCUT}{Associate new \'{e}chelle order wavelength limits with the
                  current  dataset.}
   \comdesc{NEWDISP}{Associate new spectrograph dispersion data with the
                   current  dataset.}
   \comdesc{NEWFID}{Associate new fiducial positions with the current
                  dataset.}
   \comdesc{NEWRIP}{Associate new ripple calibration data with the current
                  dataset.}

}

A log of all commands typed during an IUEDR session and program output at the
terminal can be found in the file {\tt session.lis}.
This is particularly useful when investigating the contents of IUE tapes.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{user_interface}User interface}
\markboth{User interface}{\stardocname}

The IUEDR user interface uses the Starlink ADAM parameter system.
The interface will be familiar to users of the VMS IUEDR, with a few changes
to reach a level of consistency with other Starlink packages.

\subsection {Starting IUEDR}

To initialise for IUEDR type
\begin{verbatim}
   % iuedr
\end{verbatim}

at the shell prompt \verb+%+.
The first time you type the command, IUEDR environment variables are set up in
your session.
You can now start the program by typing
\begin{verbatim}
   % iuedr
\end{verbatim}
again.
Edit your \verb+.login+ file if you want to avoid having to type the command
that extra time.

The command line interface prompt is \verb+>+\@.
This should appear after a welcome message and you can then type commands as
you would in a typical command shell.

\subsection {Response to command prompts}

Instructions to IUEDR are given as command lines.

Command lines begin with a command and an optional list of parameter
assignments. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
   > DRIMAGE DATASET=SWP14931 DEVICE=xw
\end{verbatim}

Usually IUEDR will only prompt for parameters required by commands if
they have no currently defined value.
However, some parameters are either cancelled during the execution of a
command or are set so that the user is always prompted for a value.
A command can be forced to prompt for all required parameter values thus:

\begin{verbatim}
   > READIUE PROMPT
\end{verbatim}

The \verb+PROMPT+ may be abbreviated to \verb+PR+\@.

In a similar way commands which always prompt for parameter values can be made
to accept default values thus:

\begin{verbatim}
   > READIUE ACCEPT
\end{verbatim}

Command input and output printed at the terminal is also copied to the
file \verb+session.lis+ in the working directory.
Note that this file is rewritten each time IUEDR is run.

\subsection {Response to parameter prompts}

Help about a parameter can be obtained by responding to the parameter prompt
with a question mark, {\it{e.g.,}}

\begin{verbatim}
   DATASET - Dataset Name. > ?
\end{verbatim}

Help information will then be printed at the terminal and the prompt repeated.

Sometimes an undefined parameter value is interpreted by a command in
a specific way ({\it{e.g.,}}\ auto-scaling within plotting commands)\@.
A parameter can be set undefined by responding to the prompt with an
exclamation mark, {\it{e.g.,}}

\begin{verbatim}
   XL - X-axis plotting limits, [0,0] means auto-scale. /[1150,1950]/ > !
\end{verbatim}

A command may be aborted by responding to a parameter prompt with a
double exclamation mark, {\it{e.g.,}}

\begin{verbatim}
   XL - X-axis plotting limits, [0,0] means auto-scale. /[1150,1950]/ > !!
\end{verbatim}

To prevent a command from prompting for further parameter values (once in
prompt mode) type a backslash, {\it{e.g.,}}

\begin{verbatim}
   XL - X-axis plotting limits, [0,0] means auto-scale. /[1150,1950]/ > \
\end{verbatim}

The command will then only prompt for parameters for which it cannot generate
a suitable value.

\subsection {Getting HELP}

\begin{latexonly}
Type HELP at the IUEDR command line prompt.
You may optionally append a detailed description of the topic on which help
is required. See page~\pageref{com: HELP } for further details.
\end{latexonly}

\begin{htmlonly}
Type HELP at the IUEDR command line prompt.
You may optionally append a detailed description of the topic on which help
is required. See HELP for further details.
\end{htmlonly}

\subsection {IUEDR in script and batch modes}

It is possible to run IUEDR in script mode, where command and
parameter input originates from a file instead of the terminal.
The file from which the command input is to be taken is piped into IUEDR:

\begin{verbatim}
   % iuedr < script_file
\end{verbatim}

This will result in the command input being taken from the file
\verb+script_file+ and the text output being written to the \verb+session.lis+
file.

Alternatively the output can be directed to a specific file:

\begin{verbatim}
   % iuedr < script_file > script_log
\end{verbatim}

In this case \verb+script_log+ contains the output log \verb+session.lis+ is
{\bf not} over-written.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{IUEDR_data_files}IUEDR data files}
\markboth{IUEDR data files}{\stardocname}

Once an IUE GO format file has been read by IUEDR two files are created.  One
is a text file containing information about the data set calibration data.
This file has a name constructed
\begin{verbatim}
   <dataset>.UEC
\end{verbatim}
where \verb+<dataset>+ corresponds to the value of the IUEDR \verb+DATASET+
parameter.

when a GPHOT, PHOT or RAW image is read the data produced are stored in an
Image and Data Quality file
\begin{verbatim}
   <dataset>_UED.sdf
\end{verbatim}
After the spectrum extraction process the uncalibrated spectral data are stored
in a file
\begin{verbatim}
   <dataset>_UES.sdf
\end{verbatim}
This file is also produced when an IUESIPS MELO or MEHI file is read with
\verb+READSIPS+\@.  No \verb+_UED.sdf+ being created in this case.

Calibrated spectra produced by the \verb+MAP+ command are stored in a file
\begin{verbatim}
   <dataset>_UEM.sdf
\end{verbatim}

All these \verb+.sdf+ files are Starlink NDF format files (See
\xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{}
for details of access to NDFs) which can be read by any of the standard
packages (KAPPA, FIGARO etc.).  The contents of these files can be examined
outside of IUEDR using the \verb+hdstrace+ command.

These files are in addition to the IUEDR log file \verb+session.lis+ and the
files generated by output commands.  They should {\bf not} be deleted until the
data reduction is complete and the output spectra obtained.

The \verb+OUT*+ family of IUEDR output commands also generate NDFs which can
be read by programs such as DIPSO.

In summary:
\begin {description}
   \item \verb+<dataset>.UEC+ --- calibration file.
   \item \verb+<dataset>_UED.SDF+ --- image data and quality file.
   \item \verb+<dataset>_UES.SDF+ --- uncalibrated spectrum file.
   \item \verb+<dataset>_UEM.SDF+ --- calibrated mean spectrum file.
\end {description}

{\bf Refer to Appendix~\ref{se:vmsunix} for VMS to UNIX file conversion.}

\subsection{\label{subap:ndf}NDF Components in IUEDR files}

This section gives a summary of the NDF components present in IUEDR files for
those who may wish to access the files from their own programs.
The structure and content of an NDF can be inspected using the {\tt hdstrace}
utility (See \xref{SUN/102}{sun102}{})\@.  Values for components have been
given where they are constant for all files of the particular type.

\subsubsection{Image data and quality file {\tt \_UED}}

\begin{latexonly}
A simple NDF, each point in the $768\times 768$ image is described by a datum
and a quality flag.  The image is given the generic title `IUE image'\@.
\end{latexonly}

\begin{htmlonly}
A simple NDF, each point in the 768x768 image is described by a datum
and a quality flag.  The image is given the generic title `IUE image'\@.
\end{htmlonly}

\begin{verbatim}
IUEDR  <NDF>

   DATA_ARRAY(768,768)  <_WORD>

   QUALITY        <QUALITY>       {structure}
      QUALITY(768,768)  <_UBYTE>

   TITLE          <_CHAR*9>       'IUE image'
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Uncalibrated spectrum file {\tt \_UES}}

This NDF contains IUEDR specific extensions, which are written and read by the
program when processing spectra.  In the description below {\tt no} is
the number of orders processed with the \verb+TRAK+ command.  {\tt mo} is
the number of data points in the longest order processed.
{\tt WAVES} contains the wavelengths of each of the flux data in each order.
{\tt ORDERS} holds a list of the order numbers processed.
{\tt NWAVS} stores the actual number of points in each of the {\tt no} orders.

\begin{verbatim}
IUEDR  <NDF>

   DATA_ARRAY(mo,no)   <_REAL>

   QUALITY        <QUALITY>       {structure}
      QUALITY(mo,no)   <_UBYTE>

   MORE           <EXT>           {structure}
      IUEDR_EXTRA    <EXTENSION>     {structure}

         ORDERS(no)     <_INTEGER>

   TITLE          <_CHAR*80>
   LABEL          <_CHAR*4>       'Flux'
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Calibrated mean spectrum file {\tt \_UEM}}

The mean spectrum is basically an array of flux values against a wavelength
scale.  Quality information is included in the data file.  The axes units are
also included.
This NDF type is again IUEDR specific, the unusual components are as follows.
{\tt WAVES} are wavelengths of flux data points.
{\tt WEIGHTS} are weights applied to the flux.
{\tt XCOMB1} is the start wavelength.
{\tt DXCOMB} is the wavelength step from point to point.



\begin{verbatim}
IUEDR  <NDF>

   DATA_ARRAY(17001)  <_REAL>

   QUALITY        <QUALITY>       {structure}
      QUALITY(17001)  <_UBYTE>

   LABEL          <_CHAR*40>      'Flux'
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{\label{se:spectrum}SPECTRUM format output files}

SPECTRUM is a data analysis programme written by Steve Adams at UCL\@.
Although the programme is no longer used (I guess it might be in use
somewhere\ldots) the file formats it introduced were adopted by the popular
spectrum analysis programme DIPSO (described in \xref{SUN/50}{sun50}{})\@.

The basic input to a SPECTRUM file is a single spectrum (wavelength, flux)\@.
The wavelengths should be in increasing order, and evenly spaced.

There are three variants of the SPECTRUM file format.  Using its terminology:

\begin{latexonly}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Format number & File characteristics\\
0             & Unformatted (Binary)\\
1             & Fixed Format Text\\
2             & Free-field Format Text\\
\end{tabular}
\end{latexonly}

\begin{htmlonly}
\begin{rawhtml}
<PRE>
<B>Format number     File characteristics</B>
      0           Unformatted (Binary)
      1           Fixed Format Text
      2           Free-field Format Text
</PRE>
\end{rawhtml}
\end{htmlonly}

IUEDR {\bf no longer} produces output of the SP0 type.  Instead NDFs are used.
In practice this is invisible to the user as the DIPSO SP0RD command (read
SPECTRUM format 0 file) now reads NDFs!  The other two formats are still
available.  A Description of the old SP0 format is included here in case
anyone needs to read an existing file in this format (DIPSO can still read
SP0 format via the SP0RD command)\@.

Using a FORTRAN77 notation, the contents of a SPECTRUM file can be
expressed as:

\begin{verbatim}
   PARAMETER(MAXWAV=8000) ! maximum number of wavelengths
   CHARACTER*79 CLINE1    ! first line of text
   CHARACTER*79 CLINE2    ! second line of text
   INTEGER NWAV           ! number of wavelengths
   REAL WAV(MAXWAV)       ! wavelengths
   REAL FLUX(MAXWAV)      ! fluxes
\end{verbatim}

Both \verb+CLINE1+ and \verb+CLINE2+ are totally unstructured text strings,
and are used to describe the spectrum.  The convention is that
\verb+FLUX(I)=0.0+ when its value is undefined.

Here, briefly, is the code needed to read the SPECTRUM formats:

Format number 0 is an unformatted (binary) file read by:

\begin{verbatim}
   OPEN(UNIT=1, ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL', FORM='UNFORMATTED')
   READ(1) CLINE1(1:79)
   READ(1) CLINE2(1:79)
   READ(1) NWAV
   READ(1) (WAV(I),FLUX(I),I=1,NWAV)
   CLOSE(UNIT=1)
\end{verbatim}

Format number 1 is a fixed format text file read by:

\begin{verbatim}
   OPEN(UNIT=1, ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL')
   READ(1,'(A79)') CLINE1(1:79)
   READ(1,'(A79)') CLINE2(1:79)
   READ(1,'(20X,I6)') NWAV
   READ(1,'(4(F8.3,E10.3))') (WAV(I),FLUX(I),I=1,NWAV)
   CLOSE(UNIT=1)
\end{verbatim}

Format number 2 is a free-field text file read by:

\begin{verbatim}
   OPEN(UNIT=1, ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL')
   READ(1,'(A79)') CLINE1(1:79)
   READ(1,'(A79)') CLINE2(1:79)
   READ(1,*) NWAV
   READ(1,*) (WAV(I),FLUX(I),I=1,NWAV)
   CLOSE(UNIT=1)
\end{verbatim}

The sections of FORTRAN 77 code shown above are not intended to be serious
attempts to write a SPECTRUM file reading programme.  Instead they are designed
to define the contents as succinctly as possible.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{porting_changes}Changes during the port to UNIX}
\markboth{Changes during the port to UNIX}{\stardocname}

This section describes the main changes that have been made to IUEDR
during its conversion to an ADAM based application which runs on
all Starlink supported platforms.  \xref{SUN/37}{sun37}{} gives notes on the
very latest version of IUEDR.

If you are a seasoned IUEDR user then you should study this section
especially carefully.

The most significant change from the scientific point of view is that
the precision of all floating point calculations has been upgraded to
DOUBLE PRECISION. This was done after it was noticed that for high
resolution extraction the output spectra were subject to rounding
noise at the 1\% level.

The format of the calibration file ({\tt .UEC}) created by IUEDR has
been  changed to make it more readable. A VMS program to convert
IUEDR datasets to the new format is available, see Appendix~\ref{se:vmsunix}
for details.

The functionality of the package has been enhanced to allow image data
to be read directly from disk.

The general operation of IUEDR, and all the command and parameter
names, are identical to those used in previous versions.

\subsection{IUEDR command files}

The \verb+.CMD+ style of VMS IUEDR command files is not directly supported by
UNIX IUEDR, and neither is the associated input/output redirection using
\verb+<+ and \verb+>+\@.

It is very easy to convert a {\tt .CMD} file into a UNIX IUEDR command
script.
{\it{e.g.,}}\ a {\tt DEMO.CMD} procedure:

\begin{verbatim}
   DATASET=SWP03196
   SHOW
   SCAN ORDERS=(125,66)
   TRAK APERTURE=LAP
   SHOW V=S
\end{verbatim}

would become a UNIX IUEDR command script \verb+demo.cmd+, thus:

\begin{verbatim}
   SHOW DATASET=SWP03196
   SCAN ORDERS=[125,66]
   TRAK APERTURE=LAP
   SHOW V=S
\end{verbatim}

The only changes which need be made are to move any parameter
specifications ({\it{e.g.,}}\ \verb+DATASET=+) onto the same line as the command
they apply to, and to change vector parameter specifications to use square
\verb+[]+ brackets instead of the old-style round \verb+()+ brackets.

This script can then be read into IUEDR by
\begin{verbatim}
   % iuedr < demo.cmd
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Interaction with DIPSO}

As part of the port to UNIX the
format of the default DIPSO spectrum format SP0 files has been
changed to use the STARLINK NDF data format. This means that these
files can be read by any standard STARLINK package.

The IUEDR/DIPSO user should notice no difference, as both IUEDR and
DIPSO understand the new format.

\subsection{DRIVE parameter options}

The use of the DRIVE parameter has been enhanced to allow
specification of disk files containing IUE datasets. This is intended
for use with  files obtained from online archives (RAL and NASA).

The syntax is to provide the full filename and extension in response to
the DRIVE prompt:

\begin{verbatim}
   DRIVE> SWP12345.RAW
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Specifying vector parameters}

Some IUEDR parameters ({\it{e.g.,}}\ \verb+XP+, \verb+YP+) require the
specification of a pair of numbers defining the limits of a range of values
({\it{e.g.,}}\ pixels).

The method of setting such values has changed to the ADAM style:

\begin{verbatim}
   XP=[100,300]
\end{verbatim}

Note that the square brackets are only necessary when vector
parameters are specified on the command line. They are not required
when IUEDR prompts the user for a vector parameter.

\subsection{Calibration files and the NEW* family of commands}

The missing Calibration file for SWP camera HIRES data has been added to the
IUEDR package.

The action of the \verb+NEW*+ family of commands for updating IUEDR
calibrations, geometry and so on have been altered  to improve functionality.
Users will find that the previous style of file name entry still works,
and that the following features have been added:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Both Logical Name and Environment Variable style file specifications
   may be given as parameter values, for example
   \begin{verbatim}
      > NEWABS ABSFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swphi
   \end{verbatim}
   and
   \begin{verbatim}
      > NEWABS ABSFILE=IUEDR_DATA:swphi
   \end{verbatim}
   are equivalent and allowed on all platforms.
   \item The default file name extension need not be given, however if the
   file to be read has a different extension this {\bf should} be given.
   For example,
   \begin{verbatim}
      > NEWABS ABSFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swphi
   \end{verbatim}
   and
   \begin{verbatim}
      > NEWABS ABSFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swphi.abs
   \end{verbatim}
   are {\bf both} valid.

   This behaviour is a change to the VMS-only IUEDR where the extension had
   to be omitted and the default value for the appropriate command was always
   taken.
   \item For case-sensitive file systems (like UNIX) if the Enviroment Variable
   \verb+$IUEDR_DATA+ is used as part of the file specification then the case
   of the file name itself is always converted to {\bf lower case}.  All the
   files available in the \verb+$IUEDR_DATA+ directory have lower case names
   so this is not a problem, rather it allows default calibration file names
   to be upper- or lower-case in IUEDR command scripts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation}

The excellent introduction to IUEDR
\xref{{\sl IUE Analysis---A Tutorial}}{sg7}{}
(SG/7) by Richard Tweedy has been updated for UNIX and included as a standard
part of IUEDR\@.  Some special calibration corrections described in this
document have also been added to the IUEDR package.

   these are recorded and displayed.

   A weighted mean in which the shifts determined for orders 100 to 110
   inclusive are given greater weight than other shifts is calculated.
   The individual order shifts are compared to the mean and any shift
   greater than 3 pixels from the mean position is rejected and a new value
   for the mean shift calculated from the remaining orders.
   The mean shift is displayed and the \verb+GSHIFT+ parameter is set.

   Using \verb+AGSHIFT+ it is possible to automate the spectrum extraction
   process.  It should be noted that objects with no continuum may break
   the \verb+AGSHIFT+ mechanism, giving poor shift values, in these cases
   the interactive \verb+CGSHIFT+ command should be used.

}
\sstdescription{
   This command creates a line-by-line-spectrum (LBLS) array from the
   image defined by \verb+DATASET+\@.
   The array consists of intensities $F(IR, I\lambda )$ for a grid of
   wavelengths, $W(I\lambda)$, and radial coordinates, $R(IR)$\@.
   The wavelength grid, $\lambda$, is determined in a similar way to the
   \verb+TRAK+ command, using the \verb+CUTWV+ (HIRES) and \verb+GSAMP+
   (HIRES/LORES) parameters.

   The radial coordinates are distances from the centre of the spectrum,
   derived from the template data,
   along a line perpendicular to the dispersion direction and
   measured in geometric pixels.
   The radial grid, $R$, is determined by the \verb+RL+ and \verb+RSAMP+
   parameters.

   The value of each pixel in the array corresponds to the surface
   over the image of a rectangle centred on its $(R, \lambda )$ coordinates,
   and extents

   \begin {equation}
      (R(IR) - dR / 2, R(IR) + dR / 2)
   \end {equation}
   and

   \begin {equation}
      (W(I\lambda ) - d\lambda / 2, W(I\lambda ) + d\lambda / 2)
   \end {equation}
   $dR$ is the distance between $R$ values, and $d\lambda$ is the wavelength
   step between $\lambda$ values.

   This surface integral is scaled along the $\lambda$ direction to
   correspond to an interval of 1.414 geometric pixels.
   The reason for this is to make LBLS intensities consistent with
   those produced by the \verb+TRAK+ command.
   For a particular wavelength, $W(I\lambda )$, the sum of LBLS intensities
   after removal of background should correspond to the net
   flux as measured by \verb+TRAK+\@.

\sstdescription{
   This command extracts a spectrum from an image.
   It does this by defining an evenly spaced wavelength grid along the
   spectrum, and mapping pixel intensities onto this grid in object
   and background channels.
   The background pixels are used to form a smooth background spectrum.
   The object pixels (less smooth background) are used to form the
   integrated net signal for the object.

   In the LORES case, the spectrum specified by the \verb+APERTURE+ parameter
   is extracted.

   In the HIRES case, the first \'{e}chelle order to be extracted is
   specified by \verb+ORDER+\@.
   Up to \verb+NORDER+ orders are extracted, with \verb+ORDER+ being
   decremented each time.

   The wavelength grid is defined by the region of the dispersion line
   contained in the image subset (faceplate).
   The grid spacing is set by the \verb+GSAMP+ parameter value which is
   the sample step in geometric pixels.
   The wavelength limits can optionally be constrained within the
   \'{e}chelle cutoff values by specifying \verb+CUTWV=TRUE+\@.

   The object and background channel widths and positions are determined
   automatically if \verb+AUTOSLIT=TRUE+\@.
   Otherwise, the object channel is specified by the values of the
   \verb+GSLIT+ parameter, whilst the background channel positions and
   widths are determined by the \verb+BDIST+ and \verb+BSLIT+ parameter values
   respectively.

   The \verb+EXTENDED+ and \verb+CONTINUUM+ parameters allow more precise
   control over slit determinations (see the IUEDR User Guide (MUD/45) for
   details).

   The background spectrum is smoothed with a triangle function with a
   FWHM given in geometric pixels by the \verb+BKGAV+ parameter.
   Once the background channel spectra have been obtained, they are
   extracted a further \verb+BKGIT+ times.
   Prior to each additional background extraction pixels which are
   outside \verb+BKGSD+ local standard deviations are rejected.

   The object spectrum is obtained by integrating pixel intensities
   (less smooth background) within the object channel.
   Once the object spectrum has been obtained it is extracted an
   additional \verb+CENIT+ times, the centroid positions
   from the previous extraction being used to ``follow'' the
   spectrum each time.
   The centroid spectrum (template) is smoothed by folding with a
   triangle function, FWHM given in geometric
   pixels by the \verb+CENAV+ parameter.
   Wavelengths with flux levels below \verb+CENSD+ standard deviations
   above background are not used in determining the centroid spectrum.

   By default, the initial spectrum template is given by the dispersion
   relations and the geometric shifts determined using the \verb+CGSHIFT+\@.
   However, if \verb+CENTM=TRUE+, then a pre-defined template associated with
   the dataset may be used as a start guess.
   If \verb+CENSH=TRUE+, then this template can be shifted linearly to match the
   image ({\it{i.e.}}\ without changing its shape).
   If \verb+CENSV=TRUE+, then the final centroid spectrum is used to update the
   spectrum template in the dataset.

   The net flux associated with a wavelength point in the final extracted
   spectrum is defined as the integral of pixel intensities over a rectangle
   with dimensions given by the object channel width and the wavelength
   interval.
   These fluxes are scaled so that they correspond to an interval
   along the wavelength direction of 1.414 geometric pixels.
   This is so that the standard IUESIPS calibrations can be applied
   regardless of what actual sample rate has been employed.
   The integral is performed by using linear interpolation of pixel intensities.

\section{\xlabel{paramaters}\label{se:parameters}Parameters}
\markboth{Parameters}{\stardocname}

There follows a detailed description for each of the parameters used by
IUEDR commands.
The description for a particular parameter applies in any
command which uses it.
Some parameters have default values which are initialised on invoking IUEDR\@.
Default parameter behaviour is described in
Appendix~\ref{se:parameter_defaults}\@.

This release of IUEDR uses the ADAM parameter system. In this system
the parameters and their usage are described in an interface file
(See \xref{SG/4}{sg4}{} for more detail). It is possible to override the
default
interface file with your own personal version. This permits you to tailor
the precise behavior of each parameter according to your requirements.

In the following descriptions the required parameter value is one of:
\begin{description}
   \item [\_CHAR] A character string.
   \item [\_DOUBLE] A floating point number.  The decimal point need not be
                    included if the value is integer only.
   \item [\_INTEGER] Integer number.
   \item [\_LOGICAL] A logical value: {\tt YES, TRUE, NO} or {\tt FALSE.}
\end{description}

Where a parameter value is of the form:

\begin{quote}
{\bf
   [\_TYPE\{,\_TYPE\}]
}
\end{quote}

At least one value of type {\bf \_TYPE} is required, the second is optional.

\rule{\textwidth}{0.5mm}

\iueparlist{

\iueparameter{ABSFILE}
{
   \_CHAR
}{
   This is the name of a file containing an absolute flux calibration.
   A file type of \verb+.abs+ is assumed and need not be specified
   explicitly.
   If the file name contains a directory specification, then it should be
   enclosed in quotes.
}

\iueparameter{APERTURE}
{
   \_CHAR
}{
   This is the name of an individual aperture.
   The following names have defined meanings:

   \begin {description}
      \item {\tt SAP} --- IUE small aperture.
      \item {\tt LAP} --- IUE large aperture.
   \end {description}

   Other apertures may also be defined.
}

\iueparameter{APERTURES}
{
   \_CHAR
}{
   This specifies an aperture or group of apertures.
   The following three names have defined meanings:

   \begin {description}

      \item {\tt LAP} --- IUE large aperture.
      \item {\tt BAP} --- IUE both apertures ({\it{i.e.}}\ SAP and LAP together).
   \end {description}
}

\iueparameter{AUTOSLIT}
{
   \_LOGICAL
}{
   This determines whether the extraction slit is determined automatically
   by the command.
   When \verb+AUTOSLIT=TRUE+ the \verb+GSLIT+, \verb+BDIST+ and \verb+BSLIT+
   parameter values are
   determined automatically, based on the IUE camera, resolution, aperture,
   and on the values of the \verb+EXTENDED+ and \verb+CONTINUUM+ parameters.
   This mode of operation is probably the best for point source objects.

   This parameter has a default value of \verb+TRUE+\@.
}

\iueparameter{BADITF}
{
   \_LOGICAL
}{
   This parameter determines whether a correction is made to the pixel
   intensities to account for errors during Ground Station ITF
   calibration.
   (Note that the best scientific results would be obtained
   from reprocessed data which can be obtained on request.)
   The following case is handled:

   \begin {description}
      \item SWP, LORES --- correction of 2nd (faulty) ITF.
   \end {description}
}

\iueparameter{BDIST}
{
   [\_DOUBLE\{,\_DOUBLE\}]
}{
   This is a pair of numbers delineating the background spectrum channel
   positions during spectrum extraction.
   The distances are measured in geometric pixels from the spectrum centre.

   Negative distances mean ``to the left of centre'', and positive distances
   mean ``to the right of centre''.

   If only one value is defined, then this is taken as meaning
   that the channels are positioned symmetrically
   about centre.

   The spectrum ``centre'' is determined by the dispersion relations, and
   modified by any prevailing centroid shifts.
}

\iueparameter{BKGAV}
{
   \_DOUBLE

   This is the FWHM of a triangle function filter used in folding the
   pixel intensities to form the smooth background spectrum.
   It is measured in geometric pixels.

   This parameter has a default value of 30.0.

\iueparameter{BKGIT}
{
   \_DOUBLE
}{
   This is the number of background smoothing iterations performed during
   spectrum extraction.

      the first pass of a triangle function filter with a FWHM defined by
      the \verb+BKGAV+ parameter.

      \item \verb+BKGIT=1+ means that, after producing the initial estimate for
      the smooth background, pixels discrepant by more that \verb+BKGSD+
      standard deviations are marked as ``spikes''.
      The smooth background is then re-evaluated, missing out these marked
      pixels.
   \end {description}

   Higher values of \verb+BKGIT+ are possible, but seldom necessary.

   This parameter has a default value of 1.
}

\iueparameter{BKGSD}
{
   \_DOUBLE
}{
   This is the discrimination level, measured in standard deviations,
   beyond which background pixels are marked as ``spikes''.
   It is not used for \verb+BKGIT=0+.

   This parameter has a default value of 2.0.
}

\iueparameter{BSLIT}
{
   [\_DOUBLE\{,\_DOUBLE\}]
}{
   This defines the half width of each background channel, measured
   in geometric pixels.
   A single value means that both channels have the same width.
}

\iueparameter{CAMERA}
{
   \_CHAR
}{
   This is the camera name.
   The following are defined:

   \begin {quote}
   \begin {description}
      \item {\tt LWP} --- IUE long wavelength prime.
      \item {\tt LWR} --- IUE long wavelength redundant.
      \item {\tt SWP} --- IUE short wavelength prime.

   This is the FWHM of a triangle function filter used in folding the
   pixel intensities to form the smooth spectrum centroid positions.
   It is measured in geometric pixels.

   This parameter has a default value of 30.0.

   This is the number of spectrum centroid tracking iterations performed during
   spectrum extraction.

   \begin {description}
      \item \verb+CENIT=0+ means that the spectrum position is taken directly
      from the dispersion relations.

      \item \verb+CENIT=1+ means that the spectrum position is first taken
      from the dispersion relations, but is modified to force it to
      follow the spectrum centroid.
   \end {description}

   Higher values of \verb+CENIT+ are possible, but seldom necessary:  it either
   works or fails.

   This parameter has a default value of 1.
}

\iueparameter{CENSD}
{
   \_DOUBLE
}{
   This is the discrimination level, measured in standard deviations,
   below which object signal is not considered significant enough
   to be used to determine the centroid position.
   It is not used for \verb+CENIT=0+\@.

   This parameter has a default value of 4.0.
}

\iueparameter{CENSH}
{
   \_LOGICAL
}{
   This indicates whether the spectrum signal produces a single linear
   shift to the initial template.

   This can be used in cases where the object signal is too weak
   to provide a detailed centroid determination by moving a pre-existing
   template shape into the right position.

   This parameter has a default value of \verb+FALSE+\@.

\iueparameter{CENTM}

   This is a pair of radial coordinate values defining the start and end of
   the radial grid in an LBLS array.
   These radial coordinates are measured in geometric pixels, and run

\iueparameter{VSHIFT}
{
   \_DOUBLE

   This is one of the mechanisms that can be used to delimit the
   parts of \'{e}chelle orders that are calibrated for ripple response.
   The two values of this parameter are the start and end wavelengths

\iueparameter{XCUT}
{
   [\_DOUBLE,\_DOUBLE]

\markboth{Parameter defaults}{\stardocname}

Some IUEDR parameters have default values.  Some have no default value and one
{\bf must} be provided.  Other parameters values are either calculated or
simply set by the program.  The default values and/or behaviour of each
parameter are listed here.

\begin {description}

\item [\htmlref{ABSFILE}{ABSFILE}] \lmbox
   No default value exists, a file name must be provided.
   The parameter is cancelled each time it is used.
\item [\htmlref{APERTURE}{APERTURE}] \lmbox

   If only one is present in an image then this is taken as \verb+APERTURE+ by
   default.
\item [\htmlref{APERTURES}{APERTURES}] \lmbox
   Used only by \verb+READIUE+ and \verb+READSIPS+\@.  The value must be

   Whether \verb+GSLIT+, \verb+BDIST+ and \verb+BSLIT+ are determined
   automatically.
\item [\htmlref{BADITF}{BADITF} (= TRUE)] \lmbox
   Has no default value, however it is recommended to be set \verb+TRUE+ as
   this will ensure any ITF error correction available for the particular
   \verb+ITF+ will be used.
   This may seem counter-intuitive, however, data using error-free ITF
   information will not be affected by setting \verb+BADITF=TRUE+\@.

   No automatic default.  The value is calculated if \verb+AUTOSLIT=TRUE+,
   otherwise it should be estimated by looking at \verb+SCAN+ plots.

   \verb+READIUE+ or \verb+READSIPS+ when a suggested default value will be
   presented by the program in the parameter prompt.

\item [\htmlref{TYPE}{TYPE}] \lmbox
   No default.  This must be evaluated from the IUE GO file header contents.
\item [\htmlref{V}{V} = H] \lmbox
   This parameter is cancelled each time it is used.

   No automatic default value.  If a \verb+WSHIFT+ has previously been set for
   the current \verb+DATASET+, this will be presented as the default value in
   the parameter prompt.
\item [{\htmlref{XCUT}{XCUT} =[-3.0,3.0]}] \lmbox
   Takes the value \verb+[-3.0,3.0]+ for a new dataset.

\section{\xlabel{vms_data}\label{se:vmsunix}Handling of VMS IUEDR data files}
\markboth{Handling of VMS IUEDR data files}{\stardocname}

IUEDR data files have changed format in order to allow
inter-machine operation. However, VMS IUEDR will still read the old format
files if they are present (this is only useful on the VAX as all old
format files will have been created on VAXen). If you have old format files
then you should use \verb+iuecnv+ to convert them to the new format by
following the procedure described below.
The resulting files can then be used with UNIX IUEDR.

During the conversion of an IUE dataset \verb+iuecnv+ will create a number of
binary data files. Their filenames are as follows:

\begin {description}
   \item \verb+<dataset>.UEC+ --- calibration file.
   \item \verb+<dataset>_UED.SDF+ --- image data and quality file.
   \item \verb+<dataset>_UES.SDF+ --- uncalibrated spectrum file.
   \item \verb+<dataset>_UEM.SDF+ --- calibrated mean spectrum file.
\end {description}

where \verb+<dataset>+ refers to the IUEDR DATASET parameter.

The {\tt .SDF} files are STARLINK NDF format files and can be read and
processed by any of the standard  packages ({\it{e.g.,}}\ KAPPA,FIGARO).
These files are in a machine independent format and can be freely
copied between any of the platforms which STARLINK supports.

\subsection{Moving IUEDR files to UNIX systems}

The file formats used by UNIX IUEDR are based on the STARLINK standard
NDF library. This makes the files transportable between all supported
systems. If you have old VMS IUEDR files ({\it{i.e.}}\ {\tt .UEC}, {\tt
.UED}, {\tt .UES}, {\tt .UEM} files) then these will need to be
converted into the new format {\bf before} they are transferred to a UNIX
system.

There is a VMS executable provided for this purpose, and a command file
to use it. To use the executable you must first copy:

\begin{verbatim}
   /star/bin/iuedr/iuecnv.exe
   /star/bin/iuedr/iuecnv.com
\end{verbatim}

onto your VMS system (use binary transfer for {\tt iuecnv.exe}).

When {\tt iuecnv.exe} is installed, you can then move to a directory
where your IUEDR datasets are stored and type:

\begin{verbatim}
   $ @somedisk:[somedir]iuecnv  dataset
\end{verbatim}

where {\tt somedisk:[somedir]} is wherever you copied {\tt iuecnv} to, and
{\tt dataset} is the name of an IUE dataset ({\it{e.g.,}}\ SWP23456).

The program will then locate and convert all the IUEDR datafiles
associated with the named dataset. Note that the {\tt .UEC} file is also
converted (although its name stays the same).

When conversion is complete you may copy the files ({\tt .UEC} and {\tt
*\_UE*.SDF}) to your UNIX system. The {\tt .UEC} files MUST be
transferred in ascii mode, and the {\tt .SDF} files MUST be transferred
in binary mode.

UNIX NDF expects that NDF container files end in the extension \verb+.sdf+ and
does not yet recognise \verb+.SDF+ files. Thus you may need to rename
files to have the lowercase \verb+.sdf+ extension (depending upon how
you do the transfer).

\subsection{VAX-UNIX IUEDR image file exchange}

An IUEDR image file is one of \verb+RAW+, \verb+PHOT+, or \verb+GPHOT+ type
and consist of 768 $\times$ 768 pixels each stored in a 1 or 2-byte integer.

The transfer of files between VAX and UNIX systems is complicated by
the sophistication of the VAX file system. Under VMS the system
records a complex description of the precise format of all the  files
(and stores it in  the directory entry). Under UNIX this information
has to be provided by the user of the file when it is  opened. Because
of this difference it is sometimes necessary to use the following
format conversion utilities.

\subsubsection{VAX to UNIX}

If you wish to transfer IUE image data from a VAX onto a UNIX machine
in order to use the UNIX IUEDR then the transfer should be done using
FTP (in {\bf binary} mode).

If you intend to copy the file using some other method ({\it{e.g.,}}\ via NFS)
then you should first use the command:

\begin{verbatim}
   UNIX_FORMAT image-name
\end{verbatim}

to ensure the file is properly transferred.

Note that this also applies if you wish to just access the file
via NFS without explicitly transferring it.

\subsubsection{UNIX to VAX}

If you wish to transfer IUE image data from a UNIX machine onto a VAX
in order to use the VAX IUEDR then the transfer should be done using
FTP (in {\bf binary} mode) and the command:

\begin{verbatim}
   VAX_FORMAT  image-name
\end{verbatim}

should then be used to ensure the file has the correct format.

If you use some other method of transferring the file ({\it{e.g.,}}\ NFS) then
the above command is {\bf still} required.

\subsubsection{What will work?}

In general the following two commands will allow you to use any disk
based IUE image with any machine running IUEDR:

\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt VAX\_FORMAT} sets the file format as required by VAX IUEDR
   \item {\tt UNIX\_FORMAT} sets the file format as required by UNIX IUEDR
\end{itemize}

Both commands operate only on the VAX.

\subsection{\label{se:nfs}Accessing data via NFS}

UNIX machines commonly provide disk sharing amongst remote machines
using the NFS protocol.

For example your data frame may reside on a DECstation local  disk
called \verb+iuedata+ in the Rutherford cluster on machine \verb+adam4+\@. In
order to get IUEDR to read it directly you could enter the following
in response to the DRIVE prompt:

\begin{verbatim}
   DRIVE> /adam4/iuedata/swp12345.raw
\end{verbatim}

To see which disks you have NFS access to you should use the {\tt
\%~df} command. In general any disks whose entry does not start with
\verb+/dev+ are being served by a remote machine.

{\bf IMPORTANT NOTE\\}
IUEDR allows you to use this method of data access with the following proviso.

If the data resides on a VAX served disk then you must first  convert
its directory entry (on the VAX) using the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
   $ UNIX_FORMAT image-name
\end{verbatim}

This command does not change the data in any way.  It merely alters the
description of the file format as stored in the VAX directory.

If at some later stage you wish to use the VAX version of IUEDR on the
same data file it first be necessary to use the command:

\begin{verbatim}
   $ VAX_FORMAT image-name
\end{verbatim}

to convert back.
