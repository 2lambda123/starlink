<H2>Description</H2>
This is a pair of numbers delineating the object spectrum channel during
spectrum extraction.  The distances are measured in geometric pixels.
<P>
Negative distances mean "to the left of centre", and  positive distances
mean "to the right of centre".
<P>
Object channels that do NOT cover the actual object signal  on the image
will not be meaningful when centroid tracking is employed.
<P>
If only one value is defined, then this is taken as representing  a
channel that is symmetrical about the spectrum centre.
<P>
The spectrum "centre" is determined by  the  dispersion  relations, and
modified by any prevailing centroid shifts.
