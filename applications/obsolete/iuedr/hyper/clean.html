<H2>Summary</H2>
 This command is used to mark pixels with values below a selected
 threshold as BAD.
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
   DATASET         Dataset name.
   THRESH          Smallest pixel value to be accepted as GOOD.
</PRE>
<P>
<H2>Purpose</H2>
Some IUE  datasets are effected  by horizontal  bars of low pixel values.
These are caused by a weak  signal from the IUE craft at the time of data
download.  When there are  a few bars  they can be marked as bad with the
<A HREF=edimage.html>
EDIMAGE</A>
 command.  In the case of many bars a quicker solution is to mark
all  pixels in  the image below  a user selected  threshold value as BAD.
<P>
Successive  CLEAN and <A HREF=drimage.html>
DRIMAGE</A>
 commands starting with a value of <A HREF=thresh.html>
THRESH</A>
 as
-1000 and increasing <A HREF=thresh.html>
THRESH</A>
  towards zero will  allow the user to chose a
value suitable for the problem image.
