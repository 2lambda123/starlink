<H2>Description</H2>
This is the Tape File Number.  The first file on a tape would be FILE=1.
One case  which may present  some problems is  that of  a tape with a an
End-of-volume (EOV) mark in the middle, and valuable  data  beyond.   An
EOV  is  two  consecutive Tape Marks (sometimes called "File Marks").  A
File is defined, here, as the information between two Tape Marks.  So if
the number for a (real) file before EOV is FILEN, then the number of the
next (real) file following the EOV is (FILEN+2).
