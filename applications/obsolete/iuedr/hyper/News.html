<P>
 This text describes IUEDR version 3.2-0.
 Fixes to and changes from a previous release (version 3.1-9) are
 described.

<H2>Documentation notes</H2>

<PRE WIDTH=72>
  o The IUEDR User Guide (MUD/45) has been comprehensively updated.
  o The IUEDR User Manual (SG/3) has been comprehensively updated.
    The document now has an index, extensive cross-referencing and is
    fully up-to-date with the current release and IUEDR usage.
  o The $IUEDR_USER directory now includes several C shell script
    examples for handling multiple IUE datasets.  Refer to the 
    user.info file in the $IUEDR_USER directory for an outline 
    description.
  o A few errors in the IUEDR Tutorial (SG/7) have been fixed.
  o A few errors and omissions to the help text have been fixed.
  o The out-of-date file global.doc has been removed from the
    $IUEDR_DOC directory.
  o The file problems.doc has been updated to reflect improvements in
    this version of IUEDR.

  o Data in the Calibration file (UEC) are now stored with scale factor 
    edit "1P" where appropriate.  This effectively adds an extra digit
    of precision in these figures.
  o New dispersion (*.dsp) files are available in the $IUEDR_DATA
    directory.  These new relations are used by default.  The old 
    dispersion relations can be employed using the NEWDISP (ironic, I 
    know) command, for example, the action:
<P>
       > NEWDISP DISPFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swphi.dsp
<P>
    will use the NEW dispersion relations, whereas
<P>
       > NEWDISP DISPFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swphi_old.dsp
<P>
    will use the OLD dispersion relations.  The new dispersion relations
    are from NASA IUE Newsletter No 51, August 1993.  The old data are
    dated 1982.
  o Command line editing and command history features (identical to those
    in DIPSO) are now available.
    See HELP/Command_line_editing and documentation for more details.
  o A "Hidden" Command CONFIGURE toggles the recording of all parameter
    values for commands in log files.  By default this behaviour is TRUE.
    See HELP/CONFIGURE and documentation for more details.
  o Graph titles now have a consistent style of:
<P>
       <OBJECT> (ORDER=<M>)
<P>
    for HIRES, and for LORES:
<P>
      <OBJECT> (APERTURE=<AP>)
<P>
  o The title of pseudo-SP0 format NDFs has been changed to be more
    informative of the contents of the file.
  o A new command CLEAN for marking bad strips of data in IUE images
    has been added.  See HELP/CLEAN, WWW pages or SG/3 for details.
  o A new command AGSHIFT for calculating and setting the GSHIFT parameter
    has been added.  See HELP/AGSHIFT, WWW pages or SG/3 for details.
  o The Plotting area used by PL* commands has been enlarged for most
    SGS zones.
  o Environment Variable style syntax has been added to file name loading,
    previously Logical Names and/or explicit files only were supported.
  o Support for Calibration, fiducial etc. file loading has been
    rationalised and documented.
  o Program output redirection is now possible.
    When using
<P>
       % iuedr < script_file
<P>
    the default log file session.lis is produced.
<P>
       % iuedr < script_file > script_log.lis
<P>
    will produce the log file script_log.lis INSTEAD OF session.lis
  o For TRAK the case EXTENDED=TRUE CONTINUUM=FALSE now prompts for
    BSLIT as it should.
  o The NULL parameter response can now be used as advertised in the
    manual.  It should be noted that the meaning of a NULL response is
<P>
       "use suitable defaults this time"
<P>
    For example, if XP=[200,400] and a NULL response to a prompt for XP
    (from DRIMAGE) is given then XP=[1,768] will be used, but the values
    [200,400] will be retained for subsequent DRIMAGE invocations.
  o The maximum number of pseudo-orders allowed in LBLS has been increased
    from 55 to 120 to reflect changes in the default values of GSAMP and
    RSAMP.
  o The EXIT command no longer need be present in IUEDR scripts.

<H2>Bug fixes</H2>
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
  o When Image Data Quality is altered the Data and Quality file is marked
    as required for update.  Previously this only occurred for Data
    alteration.
  o An error in SETD OBJECT which made it impossible to change the case of
    letters in the OBJECT field has been removed.
  o A small bug in the use of the NORDER parameter for HIRES TRAK, where
    the extraction would over-run the available order range has been fixed.
  o LISTIUE will process multiple files on a tape and does not re-prompt
    for FILE number.
  o A bug in the reading of fiducial positions leading to problems
    TRAKing HIRES data has been removed.
  o An error translating all environment variables returned by PSX_GETENV
    in data file reading to lower case has been removed.
  o Incorrect FWHM values written to SCAN plots, output files and listings
    have been fixed.  The SCAN subroutine for HIRES has been modified to
    use the correct FWHM rather than HWHM.  Documentation for SCANAV which
    is the HALF WHM not FWHM (as documented before) has been changed.
  o Missing parameter definitions of APERTURE for the SCAN and MAP commands
    have been added to the interface file.  The On-line help and SG/3 have
    been corrected also.
  o Titles in the PRSCAN command have been changed for HIRES so that the
    SCANDIST parameter is correctly labelled.
  o A small error in the case of failed attempts to read _UEM files has
    been corrected.  These do not produce NDF errors, rather a simple
    "not available" message.  This applies to the SHOW command.
  o A bug in the writing of Ripple correction data for Sun hosted systems
    has been fixed.  This bug precluded the use of the BARKER command on
    such machines.
  o A bug causing SGS zones to fall over when an out-of-range zone was
    chosen has been removed.
