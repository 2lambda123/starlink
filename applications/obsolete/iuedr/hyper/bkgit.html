<H3>BKGIT=number</H3>
<H2>Description</H2>
This is the number of background smoothing iterations  performed  during
spectrum extraction.
<P>
BKGIT=0 means that the background is taken as  the  result of  the first
pass of a triangle function filter with FWHM defined by the <A HREF=bkgav.html>
BKGAV
</A>
parameter.
<P>
BKGIT=1 means that,  after producing the initial estimate for the smooth
background, pixels discrepant by more that <A HREF=bkgsd.html>
BKGSD</A>
 standard deviations are
marked  as  "spikes".   The  smooth  background  is  then  re-evaluated,
missing out the marked pixels.
<P>
Higher values of BKGIT are possible, but seldom necessary.
