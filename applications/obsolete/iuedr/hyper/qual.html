with the data.  If so, then faulty points will be marked with their data
quality severity code, which is one from:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
     1    affected by extrapolated ITF
     2    affected by microphonics
     3    affected by spike
     4    affected by bright point (or user)
     5    affected by reseau mark
     6    affected by ITF truncation
     7    affected by saturation
     U    affected by user edit
</PRE>
<P>
User edits are only shown where no other fault is present.
<P>
This option  would normally  only be used  when assessing the quality of
faulty points,  possible with a view to using  them (marking them "good"
with a cursor editor).
