<P>
<H2>Purpose</H2>
This command extracts a  spectrum  from  an  image.   It  does  this  by
defining  an  evenly  spaced  wavelength  grid  along  the spectrum, and
mapping pixel intensities  onto  this  grid  in  object  and  background
channels.   The  background  pixels are used to form a smooth background
spectrum.  The object pixels (less smooth background) are used  to  form
the integrated net signal for the object.
<P>
In the LORES case  the spectrum specified  by the <A HREF=aperture.html>
APERTURE</A>
  parameter is
extracted.
<P>
In the HIRES case,  the first echelle order to be extracted is specified
by  the <A HREF=order.html>
ORDER</A>
.  Up to <A HREF=norder.html>
NORDER</A>
 orders are extracted,  with <A HREF=order.html>
ORDER</A>
 each time
being decremented.
<P>
The wavelength  grid is defined  by region  of the dispersion  line contained in  the image subset (faceplate).  The grid spacing is set by the
<A HREF=gsamp.html>
GSAMP</A>
 parameter value which is the sample step in geometric  pixels. The
wavelength limits can optionally be constrained within the echelle
cutoff values by specifying <A HREF=cutwv.html>
CUTWV</A>
=YES.
<P>
The object  and background  channel widths and positions  are determined
automatically  if <A HREF=autoslit.html>
AUTOSLIT</A>
=YES.  Otherwise,  the object channel is specified  by  the values  of the  <A HREF=gslit.html>
GSLIT</A>
 parameter,  whilst  the  background
channel positions and widths are determined by the <A HREF=bdist.html>
BDIST</A>
 and <A HREF=bslit.html>
BSLIT</A>
 parameter values respectively.
<P>
The <A HREF=extended.html>
EXTENDED</A>
 and <A HREF=continuum.html>
CONTINUUM</A>
 parameters allow  more  precise  control over
slit determinations (see
<A HREF="../iuedr_docs/mud45/node52.html">User Guide</A>).
<P>
The background spectrum is smoothed with a triangle function, FWHM given
by  the  <A HREF=bkgav.html>
BKGAV</A>
 parameter (in  geometric  pixels).  Once  the  background
channel spectra have been obtained, they are extracted a  further  <A HREF=bkgit.html>
BKGIT
</A>
times.  Prior to each additional background extraction, pixels which are
outside <A HREF=bkgsd.html>
BKGSD</A>
 local standard deviations are rejected.
<P>
The object spectrum is obtained by integrating  pixel  intensities (less
smooth background)  within the object channel.  Once the object spectrum
has been obtained, it is extracted an additional  <A HREF=cenit.html>
CENIT</A>
 times, each time
the centroid positions from the previous extraction being used to follow
the spectrum.  The centroid spectrum (template) is  smoothed by  folding
with a triangle  function,  FWHM given  by the <A HREF=cenav.html>
CENAV</A>
 parameter (in  geometric  pixels).  Wavelengths  with  flux  levels  below  <A HREF=censd.html>
CENSD</A>
 standard
deviations  above  background are not  used in determining  the centroid
spectrum.
<P>
The initial  spectrum template  is by  default given  by  the dispersion
relations.  However, if <A HREF=centm.html>
CENTM</A>
=YES then a pre-defined template associated
with the dataset may be used as a start guess.  If  <A HREF=censh.html>
CENSH</A>
=YES then  this
template can  be shifted  linearly to  match the image (without changing
its shape).  If <A HREF=censv.html>
CENSV</A>
=YES then the  final centroid  spectrum  is used to
update the spectrum template in the dataset.
<P>
The net flux associated with  a wavelength point in  the final extracted
spectrum is  defined as the integral of  pixel intensities  over a rectangle with  dimensions given by  the object  channel width and the wavelength interval.  These fluxes are  scaled so that they correspond to an
interval  along the  wavelength  direction  of 1.414  geometric  pixels.
This  is  so  that  the  standard  IUESIPS  calibrations  can be applied
regardless of what actual sample rate has been employed.   The  integral
is performed by using linear interpolation of pixel intensities.
