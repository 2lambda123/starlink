                   IUEDR Version 1.0 Release Notes
                   -------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

This Note describes changes made to IUEDR prior to Starlink release as
Version 1.0.  This information will only be of importance to the group
of pre-release users based at the UCL Starlink Node.



2  27-SEP-82

TRAK:  Pixels marked as spikes  during  background  determination  are
"unmarked" before the object spectrum is extracted.



3  28-SEP-82

MAP:  Spectrum Mapping is now done in "calibrated  wavelength"  space.
Thus  the wavelength grid is even in the final wavelengths.  For grids
that cross the 2000 A barrier, this means that  the  grid  wavelengths
are  vacuum  below  there,  and  "air" above.  Since there is a region
around 2000 A in which wavelengths  corresponding  to  the  convention
"Air above 2000 A" are ambiguous, this region is photometrically WRONG
after mapping (1999.5 to 2000 A).



4  29-SEP-82

It now no longer takes forever to read "STARTUP.CMD".

5  30-SEP-82

The GSHIFT command has gone.  Its function is  replaced  by  the  SETD
command.



6  30-SEP-82

New commands SETD, SETA, SETM allow just about all of the  calibration
parameters  to be changed.  SETD is for dataset-wide parameters.  SETA
is for APERTURE specific, and SETM is for ORDER  specific  parameters.
These   commands   effectively  allow  wavelength,  ripple  and  other
calibrations to be varied empirically to get the "right" answer.  Also
included is an empirical order overlap correction technique.



7  1-OCT-82

TRAK:  The significance criterion for centroid shifts should now  work
properly (except when Sky emission is strong and displaced relative to
object spectrum).



8  8-OCT-82

TRAK:  The integration algorithm has  been  changed  so  that  it  can
operate with single pixel wide slits.

SH:  This command  is  introduced,  and  allows  printing  of  dataset
contents.

P*:  These plotting commands  now  produce  sensible  axes  and  title
information.

PN,PE:  These commands now use different symbols  to  distinguish  bad
points.

MAP:  This now has two new parameters (FILLGAP,COVERGAP)  which  allow
flexibility  about  what  to  do when gaps are present in the original
spectra.  The default action is to produce good quality  results,  but
at  the  cost  of  gaps  in data.  The Log File now contains an almost
complete copy of terminal dialogue.

OUTRAK:  This new command allows creation of "TRAK" compatible  output
files.

OUTSPEC,OUTMEAN,OUTRAK:  These commands cancel the  OUTFILE  parameter
on  completion.   This  means that unless this parameter is specified,
then the default file name constructed by the command will be used.

TRAK:  Speeded up by a factor of 2x.



9  15-NOV-1982

TRAK:  Now has AUTOSLIT parameter which means that for  normal  cases,
the  object and background channel widths and positions are determined
autometically, based on the APERTURE, EXTENDED,  CONTINUUM  and  ORDER
parameters.

READIUE,SETD:  Now have an ITFCOR parameter  which  specifies  whether
LORES  ITF  corrections  are to be applied during spectrum extraction.
Corrections exist for the SWP ITF "SNAFFU"  and  the  recent  LWR  ITF
recalibration.

Operation:  The Log File is now called "SESSION.LIS"  (was  WORK.LOG).
The  way in which Batch Jobs run is also slightly different, since the
".LOG" file containing DCL commands is now created  in  the  directory
from which the job was submitted (and in which it runs).



10  22-NOV-1982

READIUE:   The  APERTURE  and  EXPOSURE  parameters  are  changed   to
APERTURES  and  EXPOSURES  respectively.   Also the ORDER and APERTURE
parameters are canceled by READIUE.

MTREW:  This sets FILE=1.

RIPCAL,ABSCAL  and  CUTCAL:   commands  added.   These  allow  various
Spectrum  calibrations  to  be  read  from file.  At present, the file
formats  are  not  described  so  that  only  the  standard  files  in
"IUEDRDATA" can be read.
