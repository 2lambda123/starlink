Martin Clayton, Starlink.   23rd October 1994.

This file describes IUEDR version 3.1-9.  In particular bug fixes from a
previous release (version 3.1) are described.

Documentation notes:
o  SUN/37 describing this package has been updated.
o  SG/7 the introduction to IUEDR has been updated and added to the package.
o  SG/3 and MUD/45 (the main IUEDR documentation) will be released
   in updated versions soon.
o  The out of date and redundant "man" files have been removed from the
   package.

Notes on this version:
o  The prompt has been changed back to "> " as in the VMS version.
o  Leading blanks or tabs before a command are ignored
   This used to produce a "command not know or ambiguous" message.
o  A 'minor' bug in the extraction of date information from GO tapes has
   been fixed so that non-leap year days-of-month are now correct.
o  The upper-bound wavelength limit when using MAP is now displayed correctly.
o  The read/write of *.UEC files for the APERTURES=BAP case now works correctly.
o  The interface file has been updated to reflect some bugs found.
   (e.g. MTREW resets FILE=1, this parameter was missing and hence produced
   a spurious error message.)  Some missing parameter prompts have been added.
o  The IUEDR (actually parameter system) command SET can be used to set a
   parameter, e.g.

   > SET ORDER=89 NORDER=0
   > TRAK

   This did work before but produced a "command not know or ambiguous" message.
o  Incorrect calls to Ndf read/write routines which caused program failure
   when the sequence
   > PLMEAN
   > SCAN
   was executed with a virtual memory allocation error have been removed.
o  The axis-units are now read from _UEM files so that these are available
   for *MEAN commands.  Previously axes were labelled with no units.
o  The tables produced by the CURSOR command are properly right-justified.
   Previously each column was left-justified.
o  Commands which were removed when Vn. 2.0 was released, but produced
   a simple informational message have been completely removed.
o  Most parameter prompting is now as in the VMS version and more consistent
   than in version 3.0.
o  Filenames suggested by the OUT* family of commands now reflect that the
   spectype=0 is of Ndf type.
o  An error in the treatment of NULL (!) response to parameter prompts has been
   fixed.
o  Parameters which are documented to adopt default values, (e.g. ranges for
   display) when the NULL (!) response is given to a parameter prompt now do
   this.  Previously such parameters would simply remain in the NULL state.
o  Error handling has been tidied a little, spurious messages after an
   EXIT or QUIT command are now flushed at the correct point.
o  The precision of floating point command parameters has been promoted
   to double precision.  This reflects the internal conversions already made.
o  A spurious message when the ITF parameter was set out of range has been
   removed.
o  An error in the writing of ABSCAL data in the SWP/ITF2 case has been
   removed.  (The UEC file could not be read.)
o  PLNET/PLGRS now include order/aperture in the graph title.
o  The PLSCAN command now has the HIST parameter.
o  A typographic error (1 instead of I) in the WRITE_NDF call when writing
   net spectra has been removed.  This caused truncation of all orders to
   contain the same number of flux points as the first order in the dataset.
o  The wavelength limits for each order are now read-back from the UES file.
   Previously these were all left as zero, causing plots to scale incorrectly.
o  A bug in READ_NDF which meant that reading of the mean spectrum would set
   the number of orders to 1 (i.e. only a single net spectrum is available)
   has been removed.
o  The parameter system is shutdown and restarted for each command executed.
   This means that forced prompting now works correctly.
o  The VMS version of IUEDR would crash if two UES files where read.  This
   appears to have been related to incorrect calls to READ_NDF.  The bug did
   not appear to have any effect on unix platforms.
o  The program now release SGS graphics zones correctly when finished with.
   This means that the zone limit will no longer be hit.
o  Byte order of raw data files on SunOS/Solaris machines is correctly handled.
o  Incorrect calls to graph plotting routines when PLSCANning have been
   corrected.  Quality information is now correctly displayed.
o  Memory access alignment errors during cursor commands and some plotting
   commands have been removed.
o  A bug in the OUT* family of commands limiting the file to 768 data points
   has been fixed.
o  Links to enable single commands to be executed at the shell have been
   removed.
o  Truncation of the year in the welcome banner to "199" instead of "1994"
   has been fixed.
o  The help facility has been brought up to date and some errors corrected
o  The correction files described in Richard Tweedy's SG/7 document have
   been included in the package.
o  The file swpr.FID has been removed from the $IUEDR_DATA directory.
o  The lwpr.fid and lwrr.fid files can now be read on sun machines.
o  Parameters specified on the command line now retain their case.
   This means that SWP14931 and swp14931 are treated as different datasets.
o  The COLROT and LINEROT parameters for plotting commands now work.
o  When the RS parameter is set FALSE graph axes are no longer redraw,
   this is the intended behaviour.
o  An error in obtaining the OBJECT text when using SETD has been removed.
   Trailing blanks are now removed from the title.

MJC.
