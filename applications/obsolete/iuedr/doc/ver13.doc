                   -------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

This Note describes changes made to  IUEDR  since  the  last  Starlink
release Version 1.2.



2  UPDATES

CU:   New  formats.   Also,  for  displayed  images,  wavelengths  and
intensities are printed.

MI:  (New command):  Modify image using image display cursor.

<files>:  The UED, UEQ, UES and UEM files are only read when needed.

P*:  Automatic axis limits can be specified by providing a NULL  value
for  the XL or YL parameters.  The old technique of equal values (e.g.
XL=(0,0)) is still supported, but it's simpler to type "XL=!".

LBLS:  As above but for the RL parameter.

SCAN:  (HIRES only) If the ORDERS parameter is undefined,  a  suitable
default range is adopted.

MAP:  (HIRES only) ORDERS as for SCAN.

READIUERS:   (New  command):   Reads  MELO/MEHI  from   IUESIPS 1   or
IUESIPS 2  tape.   operation  much  like  READIUE,  except  that  some
parameters and associated information are not needed.   Only  UEC  and
UES files are created.

READIUE,SETD:  The name of the ITFCOR parameter has  been  changed  to
BADITF, in order to convey its purpose more clearly.
