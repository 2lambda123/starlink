                   IUEDR Version 1.4 Release Notes
                   -------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

This Note describes changes made to  IUEDR  since  the  last  Starlink
release, Version 1.3.



2  BUG FIXES

A number of bug fixes have been made to Version 1.3:

      o  GRAFX - A bug in the  use  of  ARGSLIB  within  GRAFX.   This
         manifested  itself as a cursor hangup when a plotting session
         was initiated on one ARGS and then  moved  to  another  ARGS.
         After  this  move, any further change in ARGS device resulted
         in the interactive cursor becoming inoperative.

      o  BARKER - A bug in  the  short  wavelength  ripple  correction
         procedure  BARKER caused IUEDR to crash with a floating point
         divide by zero error when used  on  certain  saturated  HIRES
         images.  This has now been rectified.

      o  ABSOLUTE  CALIBRATIONS  -  In  updating  the  absolute   flux
         calibration  procedures  the  correction for THDA sensitivity
         was found to have been applied wrongly.  This error is  small
         (less  than  the noise, but systematic), even for the largest
         differences in  THDA  between  images,  but  will  result  in
         greater  differences between spectra than should be the case.
         I will be investigating this further.  The effects of such an
         error  are  discussed by Clavel, Gilmozzi & Prieto, 1986 (ESA
         IUE Newsletter No.  26, 65-79).

3  UPDATES

The  LORES  absolute  flux  calibrations  have  been   comprehensively
updated.   No  update of the HIRES absolute flux calibrations has been
performed.  References are to be found in the file for each individual
calibration.   Of  particular  importance  is  the availability of the
calibrations for the new ITF tables, except for the SWP  camera  which
is  still  under  investigation.  The first of these calibrations came
into use on 1987  December  20  for  the  LWP  camera.   The  absolute
calibration  data  for the old ITF tables have also been brought up to
date.  The data files used by IUEDR V1.4 are to be found in IUEDR_DATA
(if   you  have  executed  IUEDRSTART)  and  follow  the  file  naming
convention

           <Camera><Resolution><ITF>.ABS. 

For example, LWRLO1.ABS is the absolute calibration data file for  the
LWR  camera  used  in  low resolution mode with ITF1.  The appropriate
calibration data file is read in and stored in the IUEDR  ".UEC"  file
when  reading  an IUE image from tape.  Calibration files which do not
have either a "1", "2" or "3" in their name are files  containing  the
absolute  calibration  data  used  by  IUEDR  V1.3.  However, absolute
calibration files readable by  IUEDR  V1.3  cannot  be  read  by  V1.4
without  modification.   The change in structure is very simple and is
documented  within  the  data  files  themselves.   The   data   files
containing  IUEDR  V1.3  absolute calibration data, or the user's own,
may be associated with a data set using the command ABSCAL  in  IUEDR.
The  absolute calibation data associated with an IUEDR data set may be
interrogated using the command SH (i.e.  SH V=A) in IUEDR.

The ITF nomenclature used in the User Guide is slightly  different  to
that  used  by  the  IUE  Project.   The  absolute  flux calibrations,
however,  follow  the  IUE  project   nomenclature.    The   different
nomenclatures are summarised in the table below:

              User Guide                    IUE Project
              ----------                    -----------


           LWR1                          LWR Preliminary ITF
           LWR2                          LWR ITF1

           SWP1                          SWP Preliminary ITF
           SWP2 (Faulty ITF)             SWP ITF1 
           SWP3                          SWP ITF2

Further information about the ITFs can be found in Chapter 4,  Section
2 of the IUEDR User Guide.

Where possible, the  new  calibration  files  include  time  dependent
sensitivity  corrections  and  relative corrections for small aperture
spectra.  It should be noted that the small aperture IUE  spectra  are

subject  to variation and are therefore not photometric.  However, the
small aperture flux correction is designed to restore  any  wavelength
dependence  in  the  scaling  between  the  large  and  small aperture
spectra.  Corrections for trailed spectra are  also  included  in  the
data  files  but are not currently used by IUEDR.  The corrections for
trailed spectra are likely to be installed in IUEDR V2.0.



4  FUTURE

This version of IUEDR is the last release  of  IUEDR  which  uses  the
GRAFX  and DIAGRAM I graphics packages.  IUEDR V2.0, to be released in
1988, will use GKS 7.2 based graphics allowing the use  of  a  greater
selection of graphics devices than is presently possible.

Although the release notes for IUEDR and some other documentation have
been  tidied up, the User Guide has remained the same.  It is intended
that a comprehensive rewrite of  the  User  Guide  will  be  done  and
released with IUEDR V2.0 in 1988.  Furthermore, the bug reports in the
file "BUGS.DOC" will be placed in the appropriate release notes.

In preparing Version 1.4 for release it was noted  that  a  number  of
calibration  data  sets  other than the absolute calibrations had been
superseded since the release of Version 1.3.  These will be looked  at
in detail during the development of IUEDR V2.0 with a view to bringing
all the calibration data up to date.
