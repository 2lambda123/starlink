                       IUEDR       Version    3  - Release    notes








   1   Introduction



   This document describes the main changes that have been made to IUEDR during its conversion to an

   ADAM  based application which runs on both VAX and UNIX based systems.


   The most significant change from the scientific point of view is that the precision of all floating point

   calculations has been upgraded to DOUBLE PRECISION. This was done after it was noticed that for

   high resolution extraction the output spectra were subject to rounding noise at the 1% level.


   The format of the calibration file (.UEC) created by IUEDR3 has been changed to make it more readable.

   Old format files can still be read, the format being automatically determined by the program.


   The functionality of the package has been enhanced to allow image data to be read directly from disk,

   and command procedures are provided to automatically retreive images from the IUE archives.


   The general operation of IUEDR3, and all the command and parameter names, are identical to those

   used in previous versions.




   2   UNIX      version




   This release of IUEDR is written to run from the ICL command language. However, this is not yet

   available on all UNIX platforms. In these cases IUEDR3 runs as a single task which prompts the user

   for IUEDR3 specific commands.


   To start the IUEDR3 monolith task type


   IUEDR3  at the system prompt


   the monolith then prompts repeatedly for IUEDR3 commands until exit.


   To exit from this task type


                 EXIT  at the `iuedr>' prompt


   To access the on-line help type


                 HELP  at the `iuedr>' prompt


   To abort a task type


                 <CTRL-C>   at any point (but preferably at the `iuedr>' prompt)


   In addition to running as a monolithic task each IUEDR3 command is also available from the UNIX

   command line. Thus you can type


                 TRAK


   at the system prompt and the IUEDR3 TRAK command will be invoked.


   However, it is important to remember that in this case the program is re-started for each individual

   command and any previous context is lost leading to the inefficient re-reading of files.

   3   Log    files




   The creation of log files recording the output of IUEDR3 is different depending upon whether you are

   running under ICL or not (not available for all UNIX platforms at the time of writing).





   3.1   From  ICL



   ICL has its own message logging and reporting functions and information on these can be found using

   the HELP command.


   For convenience IUEDR3 defines the alias HISTORY as a shorthand command to provide a replay of

   the session log. By default this log is stored in SESSION.DAT and may be examined using the ICL

   REPFILE  command.


   To direct the logging to a different file the ICL command


                 REPORT   filename


   may be used.




   3.2   From  UNIX



   Until ICL arrives on your UNIX platform the easiest way to create a log of a sequence of IUEDR3

   commands is to place the commands in an ascii file (using an editor of your choice) and then type


   filename > log-filename


   at the system prompt.


   If you only need to log the output of a single command then you can simply type


   iuedr3-command > log-filename






   4   IUEDR3        command       files



   The .CMD style of IUEDR command files is not directly supported by ICL, and neither is the associated

   input/output redirection using < and >.


   ICL command procedures provide this functionality in the version 3.


   It is very easy to convert a.CMD file into an ICL command procedure.


   Eg. DEMO.CMD   procedure...


                 DATASET=SWP03196


                 SHOW


                 TRAK  APERTURE=LAP


                 SHOW   V=S


   would become ICL procedure


                 SHOW   DATASET=SWP03196


                 TRAK  APERTURE=LAP


                 SHOW   V=S


   The only changes which need be made are to move any parameter specifications (eg DATASET=) onto

   the same line as they command they apply to.


   ICL command procedures are run by typing












   SUN/???                                                                               3




                 LOAD  procedure-name


   at the ICL prompt.


   ICL procedures may contain any valid ICL commands as well as the IUEDR3 provided command set.

   In addition you may include commands provided by other monoliths (eg KAPPA,PONGO) to access

   functions not integrated into IUEDR3.


   If ICL is not yet available on your machine then you may simply type the name of your command file at

   the system prompt and the IUEDR3 commands will be executed by the system shell.






   5   DRIVE       parameter      options




   The use of the DRIVE parameter has been enhanced to allow specification of disk files containing IUE

   datasets. This is intended for use with files obtained from online archives (RAL and NASA).


   The sytax is to provide the full filename and extension in response to the DRIVE prompt.


   Eg.               DRIVE>  SWP12345.RAW


   Two command  procedures are provided to help automate the retreival of datasets from the archives :


                 NDADSA_FETCH    and RLVAD_FETCH


   retreive datasets from their respective archive sites. To use the procedures type


                 NDADSA_FETCH    parmameter-1 [parameter-2]


   The first parameter may be either a dataset identifier (eg SWP12345) or the name of a file containing a

   list of dataset identifiers (one per line).


   The second parameter is optional and specifies the type of dataset required. The default value is RAW,

   meaning raw data image. The set of available types is


                               RAW  raw data image


                               MELO  extracted lo-res spectrum


                               ELBL  extracted line-by-line hi-res spectra


   Eg.               NDADSA_FETCH    images.lis ELBL


   would attempt to retreive a set of ELBL files whose identifiers are listed on the file `images.lis'


   The process can take some time depending upon the network load and the number of datasets requested.

   It may be convenient to let the job run in the background by typing :


                 SPAWN/NOWAIT     NDADSA_FETCH    images.lis ELBL





   6   VAX-UNIX          IUEDR      image     file exchange



   An IUEDR  image file is one of RAW,PHOT, or GPHOT type and consist of 768 by 768 pixels each stored

   in a 1 or 2-byte integer.


   The transfer of files between VAX and UNIX systems is complicated by the sophistication of the VAX

   file system. Under VMS the system records a complex description of the precise format of all the files

   (and stores it in the directory entry). Under UNIX this information has to be provided by the user of

   the file when it is opened. Because of this difference it is sometimes necessary to use the following format

   conversion utilities












   SUN/???                                                                               4




   6.1   VAX   to UNIX




   If you wish to transfer IUE image data from a VAX onto a UNIX machine in order to use the UNIX

   IUEDR3  then the transfer should be done using FTP (in BINARY mode).


   If you intend to copy the file using some other method (eg via NFS) then you should first use the command


                 UNIX_FORMAT    image-name


   to ensure the file is properly transferred.


   Note that this also applies if you wish to just access the file via NFS without explicitly transferring it.




   6.2   UNIX   to  VAX



   If you wish to transfer IUE image data from a UNIX machine onto a VAX in order to use the VAX

   IUEDR3  then the transfer should be done using FTP (in BINARY mode) and the command


                 VAX_FORMAT    image-name


   should then be used to ensure the file has the correct format.


   If you use some other method of transferring the file (eg NFS) then the above command is still required.





   6.3   What   will work?



   In general the following two commands will allow you to use any disk based IUE image with any machine

   running IUEDR3 :


                  VAX_FORMAT   sets the file format as required by VAX IUEDR3


                 UNIX_FORMAT    sets the file format as required by UNIX IUEDR3


   Both commands operate only on the VAX.


   The following illustrate some of the situations in which the format conversions are used :



      o Copy file from archive onto VAX


          - YES using VAX IUEDR3


          - NO using UNIX IUEDR3  and accessing file via NFS (use UNIX_FORMAT filename).


      o FTP file from VAX to a UNIX system using BINARY transfer


          - YES using UNIX IUEDR3


          - UNKNOWN    using VAX IUEDR3 and accessing file via NFS)


      o FTP file from UNIX to a VAX system using BINARY transfer


          - NO using VAX IUEDR3  (use VAX_FORMAT   filename command).


          - YES using UNIX IUEDR3  and accessing file via NFS)


      o NFS copy file from VAX to a UNIX system after using UNIX_FORMAT filename


          - YES using UNIX IUEDR3


          - UNKNOWN    using VAX IUEDR3 and accessing file via NFS)












   SUN/???                                                                               5




   7   Accessing      data   via  NFS




   UNIX machines commonly provide disk sharing amongst remote machines using the NFS protocol.


   For example your data frame may reside on a DECstation local disk called `iuedata' in the Rutherford

   cluster on machine `adam4'. In order to get IUEDR3 to read it directly you could enter the following in

   response to the DRIVE prompt :


                 DRIVE>   /adam4/iuedata/swp12345.raw


   To see which disks you have NFS access to you should use the


                 df


   command. In general any disks whose entry does not start with a `/dev' are being served by a remote

   machine.


   IMPORTANT   NOTE


   IUEDR3  allows you to use this method of data access with the following proviso.


   If the data resides on a VAX served disk then you must first convert its directory entry using the following

   command :


                 UNIX_FORMAT    image-name


   This command does not change the data in any way. It merely alters the description of the file format

   as stored in the VAX directory.


   If at some later stage you wish to use the VAX version of IUEDR3 on the same data file it first be

   necessary to use the command


                 VAX_FORMAT    image-name


   to convert back.



   8   Using    on-line    HELP



   IUEDR3  now has a selection of methods for obtaining on-line help.



      o From the VAX command line you may type


                      HELP  IUEDR


      o From the ICL command line you may type


                      HELP  IUEDR


      o From the IUEDR3 prompt on a UNIX machine you may type


                      HELP


      o From any IUEDR3 parameter prompt on any machine you may type


                      ? for help on that parameter


                      ?? for help and to browse the help library



   9   Specifying      vector   parameters



   Some IUEDR3  parameters (eg. XP, YP) require the specification of a pair of numbers defining the limits

   of a range of values (eg pixels).


   The method of setting such values has changed to the ADAM style :


                 XP=[100,300]


   Note that the square brackets are only necessary when vector parameters are specified on the command

   line. They are not required when IUEDR3 prompts the user for a vector parameter.
