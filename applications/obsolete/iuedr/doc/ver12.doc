                   IUEDR Version 1.2 Release Notes
                   -------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

This Release Note describes changes introduced with IUEDR Version 1.2.
IUEDR  users  familiar with the User Guide can use these notes to find
out how to use new commands and facilities.  The User  Guide  has  NOT
been  updated  to  reflect ALL of these changes; however, updated HELP
and Manual entries are available.



2  SUMMARY

One  minor  "bug"  has  been  corrected.   This  bug  was  related  to
wavelength scales and should have been very apparent to users; that it
was not reported to the Author  or  Starlink  implies  that  very  few
people  (if  any)  are  affected.   The following commands are changed
(improved):

      PC, PE, PF, PM, PN, PS, CU, TRAK, OUTSPEC, OUTMEAN, SH, SETM

These changes are  mostly  "transparent"  in  that  they  provide  new
facilities and capabilities.

Where sensible, the initial defaults for parameters have been arranged
so  that  the  effect  of  earlier versions is maintained.  Of course,
users who wish to take advantage of these new facilities all the  time
can  create/modify  their  personal LOGIN.CMD file.  The following new
commands are introduced:

      LBLS         Create LBLS array from image
      DI           Display Image on ARGS
      EI           Edit Image using ARGS cursor
      CUL          Set display limits using graphics cursor
      PRINTSCAN    Print table of SCAN fluxes
      PRINTGRS     Print table of gross and background

      LINEROT      Whether line style is rotated through a sequence 
                   (PC, PE, PF, PM, PN, PS).
      COL          Line Colour index (1, 2, 3, etc.) for plotting 
                   (PC, PE, PF, PM, PN, PS).

                   (PE, PF, PM, PN).

                   (DI, CUL).

      SPECTYPE     Type of SPECTRUM compatible file produced (OUTSPEC,
                   OUTMEAN, OUTSCAN, OUTNET).

The structure of the Command Manual has been rationalised to  make  it
easier  to  read  and  maintain.  The Manual is much more compact than
before.

Additional features which are not Command/Parameter specific include:

      o  Reduced virtual memory requirements.

      o  Redirection of  printable  output  to  files  (which  can  be
         printed within a session).

      o  Better control over the submission of Batch Jobs.

      o  Improvements to  the  way  in  which  scripts  are  processed
         (prompting and echoing).




3  BUG CORRECTIONS

A full account of these and other bugs can be found in the files:

      IUEDR_DOC:BUGS.LIS
      IUEDR_DOC:BUGS.DOC

SETA:  When used to set a velocity correction by, for example:

      SETA VSHIFT=150.5

this velocity was only associated with the dataset for  the  remainder
of  the  IUEDR  session,  or  until the dataset is changed (which ever
comes sooner).  When a dataset was  read  from  disk  into  IUEDR  the
velocity  corrections  were  always  zero.   Velocities are now always
remembered properly, and can be inspected using:

      SH V=




4  MANUAL

The Manual information has been  re-organised  to  take  account  more
sensibly  of  the  fact  that  parameters  are  "global" and hence not
necessarily  restricted  to  any  particular  command.    The   Manual
consists, as before, of files:

      IUEDR_MAN:command.LIS
      IUEDR_MAN:command.DOC

where "command" is the name of the IUEDR  Command.   These  files  now
contain  a  description of the command and a summary of the parameters
used.  Detailed descriptions of the parameters can  be  found  in  the
files:

      IUEDR_DOC:GLOBAL.LIS
      IUEDR_DOC:GLOBAL.DOC

The HELP facility is unchanged.

5  REDIRECTION OF OUTPUT

With few exceptions, IUEDR commands which output  textual  information
send  this  directly  to  the  command terminal.  In some cases, it is
helpful  if  this  can  be  diverted  to  a   file,   which   can   be
inspected/printed  at  some  later  time.   This  can  be done by, for
example:

      LISTIUE  FILE=1  NFILE=-1  >JRG029

In this case the primary output from the LISTIUE command  is  sent  to
the  file "JRG029.LIS", and does not appear on the terminal.  If it is
necessary to specify a more precise file name, then this can  be  done
by using a quoted string:

      LISTIUE  FILE=1  NFILE=-1  >"U1:[JRG.IUEDR]JRG029.TXT"

Certain text  will  always  appear  on  the  command  terminal.   This
includes  prompts  for parameter values, and also messages designed to
keep the user informed about WHEN things are happening as in:

      Reading Image from Tape

Sometimes it is helpful to see the output on the terminal AND send  it
to a file.  This can be done using, for example:

      LISTIUE  FILE=1  NFILE=-1  &JRG029

It should be emphasised that this redirection facility can be used for
ANY  IUEDR  command.  However, it is expected to find most application
in the LISTIUE, PRINT* and SH commands.



6  LBLS ARRAY

The LBLS command is  introduced  to  produce  a  line-by-line-spectrum
(LBLS)  similar  to  the corresponding IUESIPS product.  The LBLS is a
2-dimensional array with wavelength along one axis and  distance  from
spectrum "centre" along the other.  Applications include:

      o  Access to spatial information  present  in  extended  objects
         observed through LAP.

      o  Inspecting the region of the image along a spectrum in  order
         to establish the reality of features.

Like the TRAK command, the LBLS array is produced either for  a  LORES
aperture or a HIRES order, as in:

      LBLS  APERTURE=LAP


                                - 4 -
IUEDR Version 1.2 Release Notes                                 Page 5


or

      LBLS  ORDER=89

The initial defaults for parameters which affect the operation of LBLS
are described by:

      LBLS  RL=(0,0),RSAMP=0.707,GSAMP=1.414,CUTWV=NO

The RL parameter values are used along with RSAMP in  determining  the
grid  of  R coordinates (measured in geometric pixels perpendicular to
dispersion).  The case RL=(0,0) means that the range of R  coordinates
will  be  decided  by the LBLS command, based on available information
(camera, resolution, aperture, etc.).

The RSAMP value indicates the spacing between positions on the  R-grid
(in geometric pixels).  The R-grid can be specified explicitly by, for
example:

      LBLS  RL=(-10,10),RSAMP=1.0

The  default  R-grid  is  only  really  useful  for  HIRES,  since  it
guarantees  that  it  will  cover  the  area  around the Echelle order
properly.

There is a practical limit to the extent of the R-grid, so  that  (for
example):

      LBLS  RL=(-50,50),RSAMP=0.1

would not be possible.  The actual limit is not easily described,  but
is designed not to be exceeded by serious attempts to use LBLS.

The wavelength grid is determined by the GSAMP and  CUTWV  parameters,
which share value and meaning with their use in the TRAK command.

The sampling rate of the  old  IUESIPS  LBLS  data  can  be  simulated
(roughly) by:

      LBLS  RL=(-38.178,38.178),RSAMP=1.414,GSAMP=1.414,CUTWV=YES

However, better resolution can be obtained with:

      LBLS  RL=(-16,16),RSAMP=1.0,GSAMP=1.0,CUTWV=YES

Each pixel in the LBLS array represents a  surface  integral  of  size
RSAMP  x  GSAMP geometric pixels (spatial x wavelength).  However, the
intensities have been scaled (as with  TRAK)  so  that  the  effective
wavelength  bin  is  equivalent to 1.414 geometric pixels.  This is so
that, if the background were removed and pixels for a given wavelength
were  "added up", then the existing IUESIPS absolute calibration could
be used directly (LORES at least).

The PRINTLBLS and OUTLBLS comands are described separately below.



7  SPECTRUM EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES

TRAK, LBLS:  The technique used for integrating pixel  intensities  is
now stabilised against over-sampling problems.

In TRAK, the intensity of a point in the spectrum is  defined  as  the
integral  of  image  intensity  over  a rectangle at its centre.  This
rectangle  has  a  dimension  along  the  dispersion   direction   (W)
corresponding  to  GSAMP  geometric  pixels,  and  a  dimension in the
direction  perpendicular  to  dispersion  (R)  of  (GSLIT(2)-GSLIT(1))
geometric pixels.

In LBLS the only difference is in  the  dimension  of  this  rectangle
perpendicular  to  dispersion  which  is  RSAMP geometric pixels.  The
integral over this rectangle is formed by  folding  pixel  intensities
with a 2-D function of the form:

      F(DR,DW) = F(DR)*F(DW)

where

      FR(DR) = MAX(1.0, RPEAK*(1.0 - DR/RFWHM))

and

      FW(DW) = MAX(1.0, WPEAK*(1.0 - DW/FWHM))

DR and DW are the absolute distances of the pixel from  the  rectangle
centre  measured  along  the R and W directions (in geometric pixels).
The integral is then:

      AREA * SUMOF ( FN(P)*FR(DR)*FW(DW) ) / SUMOF ( FR(DR)*FW(DW) )

where AREA is the effective area of the rectangle, and  the  ratio  of
summations  over pixels are the weighted mean intensity per pixel, and
FN(P) is the intensity of pixel P.

The functions FW(DW) and FR(DR) are in fact truncated  triangles  with
bases of half width RBASE and WBASE, and peaks RPEAK and WPEAK.

The parameters describing these folding functions  are  obtained  from
the following criteria:

      o  The full width at  0.5  intensity  must  be  at  least  0.707
         geometric pixels.




                                - 6 -
IUEDR Version 1.2 Release Notes                                 Page 7


      o  The product of full widths at 0.5 intensity must be at  least
         1.0 geometric pixels.

      o  Precedence  is  given  to  resolution   in   the   wavelength
         direction.

This is achieved by the following (Fortran) sequence:

      WMID = MAX( 0.707, GSAMP)
      RMID = MAX (1.0/WMID), RSAMP)

where  GSAMP  and  RSAMP  are  the  values  of   their   corresponding
Parameters.  (In the case of TRAK RSAMP=(GSLIT(2)=GSLIT(1)).) Then for
W:

      WBASE = WMID + 0.707
      WFWHM = WBASE/2.0
      WPEAK = 0.5*WBASE/(WBASE - WMID)

and R

      RBASE = RMID + 0.707
      RFWHM = RBASE/2.0
      RPEAK = 0.5*RBASE/(RBASE - RMID)

In both TRAK  and  LBLS  the  intensities  are  scaled  so  that  they
correspond  to  an  integral  of  1.414  geometric  pixels  along  the
wavelength direction.   This  means  that,  in  the  LORES  case,  the
standard IUESIPS absolute calibration functions can be applied without
scaling.

The primary consequence of this algorithm  is  in  the  LBLS  command.
Consider the example:

      LBLS  GSAMP=0.707,RSAMP=0.707

The folding function along wavelength will have FWHM  0.707  geometric
pixels, however that perpendicular to dispersion will be:

      MAX(1.414, RSAMP)

If it is needed to obtain high  spatial  resolution,  then  wavelength
resolution must be forfeited by adopting a higher GSAMP value.



8  SPECTRUM EXTRACTION WAVELENGTH GRIDS

TRAK, LBLS:  The CUTWV parameter is introduced.  It  controls  whether
the Echelle Wavelength Clipping limits associated with a HIRES dataset
are used as the start-end wavelengths in  the  extracted  spectrum  or
LBLS array.  These limits can be displayed using:

                                - 7 -
IUEDR Version 1.2 Release Notes                                 Page 8


      SH V=R

The initial default is  CUTWV=NO,  which  means  that  the  extraction
wavelength  grid  is  determined by the intersection of the dispersion
line with the faceplate "circle".  For example,  the  wavelength  grid
for order 89 in LWR is:

      (2575.030,2620.598)

In the case of the LWR camera, this leads to the bad photometry on the
faceplate  ring  disrupting  the  accuracy  of  the  background (after
smoothing).   By  setting  CUTWV=YES  for  the  above   example,   the
wavelength grid would be:

      (2580.0,2615.0)

Which entirely avoids the faceplate ring defects, but at the  possible
expense  of  losing features at the ends of the order.  If you want to
look at features outside the Clipping limits for a  particular  order,
then these limits can be changed using, for example:

      SETM  WCUT=(2577.0,2617.0)

(see further on about changes to the operation of SETM).



9  SPECTRUM EXTRACTION TEMPLATES

The path of a spectrum across an IUE  image  is  represented  only  to
first  approximation  by  the  (almost) linear function defined by the
dispersion constants.  Small-scale geometric distortions mean that the
actual spectrum path will depart from that specified by the dispersion
constants.  We can  think  of  the  spectrum  as  departing  from  the
dispersion line in two ways:

      o  A  linear   shift   with   components   in   wavelength   and
         perpendicular to dispersion.

      o  A detailed shape.

Given a reasonable object signal, both of these can be defined  during
spectrum  extraction  using  a  centroid approach.  However, there are
situations where it would be better  to  not  determine  the  detailed
shape from a particular image.

For example, the signal may be so weak that the effects of  noise  and
blemishes  produce an unrealistic "shape" from the centroids.  In this
case, we should like to adopt a  detailed  shape  from  a  calibration
image  (the  shape  doesn't  change  much in time), and merely use the
object signal in our image to shift this into alignment.


                                - 8 -
IUEDR Version 1.2 Release Notes                                 Page 9


In using the LBLS command, no analysis  is  performed  on  the  object
signal centroids, thus it is essential to know the precise location of
the spectrum on the image beforehand.  This can be obtained, as above,
from  a  calibration image, or more simple by running TRAK on the same
image.

The detailed spectrum shapes are called (spectrum) "templates".   They
consist  a  set  of  displacements, DR, perpendicular to dispersion at
specified wavelengths.

These templates can be associated with a DATASET  and  stored  in  the
".UEC" file.  By typing:

      SH V=C

the orders (HIRES)  or  apertures  (LORES)  for  which  templates  are
defined are displayed.

There are a number of ways in which these templates can be defined.

      o  They may be supplied automatically by  the  READIUE  command,
         while  the  dataset  is  being read from tape.  However, this
         will not apply to datasets created prior to version 1.2.

      o  They may be read into the  dataset  explicitly  from  a  file
         using the TEMCAL command.

      o  They may be created by using the TRAK command and associating
         the  resultant  centroid shifts with the template calibration
         in that dataset (CENSV parameter).

TEMCAL(NEW):  This new command can be used to read  templates  into  a
dataset, as in:

      TEMCAL  TEMFILE="IUEDR_DATA:SWPHILAP"

which reads the file "SWPHILAP.TEM" from  the  "IUEDRDATA"  directory.
Here  is  a  list  of  the  names of files containing various Template
Calibrations:

      FILE            CONTENTS
      SWPHILAP.TEM    SWP,LAP,HIRES
      SWPHISAP.TEM    SWP,SAP,HIRES
      LWRHILAP.TEM    LWR,LAP,HIRES
      LWRHISAP.TEM    LWR,SAP,HIRES
      LWPHILAP.TEM    LWP,LAP,HIRES

      SWPLO.TEM       SWP,LORES
      LWRLO.TEM       LWR,LORES
      LWPLO.TEM       LWP,LORES

Due to lack of suitable calibration images, some of  these  files  may

not exist at the present.

The internal format of these ".TEM" files will  not  be  described  at
this  time.   However,  it  is  possible  for users to create template
files, based on their own "calibration"  images.   This  can  be  done
using the TRAK and the OUTEM commands.

OUTEM(NEW):  This new command can be  used  to  output  the  templates
associated with a dataset to a text file, as in:

      OUTEM  TEMFILE=SWP3196

This creates a file "SWP3196.TEM", which can subsequently be input  to
other datasets (other images) using the TEMCAL command.

It should be reaslised that TRAK does not automatically store centroid
shifts  in  the  dataset.   This  must be done by specifying the CENSV
parameter.

TRAK:  The CENSV parameter is introduced to allow the centroid  shifts
determined  by  TRAK  to  be  stored as a template in the dataset.  An
example is:

      TRAK  CENSV=YES,CENIT=1

Note that the initial default for CENSV=NO.

The standard templates (in the files listed  above)  were  created  by
extracting spectra of various types with CENSV=YES.

TRAK, LBLS:  The CENTM parameter  is  introduced.   This  is  used  to
indicate  whether any available predefined spectrum templates are used
to modify the dispersion relations in specifying where the spectrum is
on the image.  In the case of TRAK this may just represent an improved
initial guess to  the  spectrum  shape,  to  be  refined  by  centroid
iterations (CENIT=1).

Although TRAK can very often determine  the  detailed  spectrum  shape
from  the object signal, LBLS (to be described) cannot do this.  Also,
in some cases, the object signal is too weak to specify  the  detailed
spectrum shape.

These predefined spectrum  templates  can  be  produced  by  the  TRAK
command,  stored  with a dataset, written to a separate file, and read
into a dataset from a file.  Thus "standard" spectrum  shapes  can  be
determined from good quality images for use with weak ones.

TRAK:   The  CENSH  parameter  controls   whether,   during   centroid
iterations,  the  object  signal  is  just  used  to shift the initial
template (CENSH=YES)  without  changing  its  shape,  or  whether  the
detailed shape can be refined (CENSH=NO).


                                - 10 -
IUEDR Version 1.2 Release Notes                                Page 11


For weak object signals, the best approach would be to use a  standard
spectrum  template (see below on how to get this), and just shift this
laterally to allign with the data.  This can be done by, for example:

      TRAK  CENTM=YES,CENSH=YES,CENIT=1

The assumption here is that the shapes of the calibration  and  object
spectra   are   similar,   suffering   only   a   linear  displacement
(perpendicular to dispersion).

In the  case  of  HIRES  where  the  spectrum  contains  gaps  (strong
absorption  features),  the  adoption of a pre-defined template allows
precise  signal  location;  this  is  important  in  positioning   the
inter-order channels.

The initial template can be used simply as a good first  approximation
to the detailed shape, using:

      TRAK CENTM=YES,CENSH=NO,CENIT=1

This approach is not recommended unless there  are  good  reasons  for
thinking  that  the  pre-defined template has a different "shape" from
the actual spectrum; in which case, it is  probably  better  to  start
from the dispersion constants:

      TRAK CENTM=NO,CENSH=NO,CENIT=1

which is the initial default.



10  SPECTRUM EXTRACTION BACKGROUND SLITS

TRAK:  It is now possible to specify, with complete freedom, the GSLIT
and  BDIST  parameter  values.   For  example,  in  order  to  use the
background on one side of a spectrum:

      TRAK ...,AUTOSLIT=NO,GSLIT=(-8.0,0.0),BDIST=(-10,-10)

This works for both LORES and HIRES, but it must  be  remembered  that
for  HIRES  it  is  necessary  to specify EXTENDED=YES,CONTINUUM=NO in
order to be allowed to over-ride the standard  restrictions  on  GSLIT
and BDIST.



11  PRINT COMMANDS

A number commands have been added which allow various kinds of data to
be  output  in tabular form.  These commands generally produce a large
amount of output which should be diverted away from the  terminal  and
to  a file (using the ">" command line syntax) for subsequent spooling

                                - 11 -
IUEDR Version 1.2 Release Notes                                Page 12


to a line-printer.

The outputs are intended for "visual" examination,  and  their  format
cannot be guaranteed to remain the same; therefore, they should not be
read into programs!

PRINTSCAN(NEW):  This new  command  can  be  used  to  print  a  table
containing  the  intensities  in  the current scan (as produced by the
SCAN command).  For example:

      SCAN
      PRINTSCAN  >SWP3196P

PRINTGRS(NEW):  This new  command  can  be  used  to  output  detailed
information (gross, net, smooth background, calibrated flux) available
following spectrum extraction with the TRAK command.  For example:

      TRAK
      PRINTGRS  >SWP3196G

PRINTSPEC(NEW):  This new command prints out the  net  and  calibrated
fluxes for a spectrum (LORES aperture or HIRES order), as in:

      PRINTSPEC  DATASET=SWP3196  APERTURE=LAP  >SWP3196L

or

      PRINTSPEC  DATASET=SWP6766  ORDER=89  >"SWP6766.89"

which prints a table consisting  of  Wavelength,  Net  and  Calibrated
Fluxes, along with any data quality information.

PRINTMEAN(NEW):  This new command can be used  to  tabulate  the  mean
spectrum, as in:

      PRINTMEAN  >SWP3196M

It is important to realise, when using this  command  that  some  mean
spectra  may  involve  20000  points, and that this would lead to over
20000 lines of output!

PRINTLBLS(NEW):  This new command can be used to tabulate the  current
LBLS array, as in:

      PRINTLBLS  >SWP3196R

It should be born in mind that since the LBLS command allows the array
size  to  be  selected  at  creation,  arrays with more than a certain
number of R-values  cannot  be  printed  "sensibly".   However,  every
effort  is  made to print the pixel intensities for a given wavelength
on a single output line.

12  DATA OUTPUT COMMANDS

Some additional "OUT" commands have been added  which  produce  output
files  suitable  for  input  to  separate  data reduction and analysis
programs.

For  spectrum-like  data,  the  OUTSPEC  and  OUTMEAN   commands   are
complemented  by  OUTNET  and  OUTSCAN.  All of these commands produce
files suitable for input to either  SPECTRUM  (Steve  Adams,  UCL)  or
DIPSO (Maslen & Howarth, UCL).

The OUTLBLS command is introduced to make the LBLS array available  to
separate   analysis   programs.    OUTNET(NEW):    This   produces   a
SPECTRUM/DIPSO file containing the uncalibrated Net spectrum.  If  the
OUTFILE parameter is not specified, a default file name is constructed
using the camera,  image  number  and  aperture/order,  which  can  be
inspected with:

      OUTNET OUTFILE=?

All of the calibrations concerned with intensity are omitted.   OUTNET
is expected to be helpful for cases where calibrations will be handled
independently.

OUTSCAN(NEW):  This command produces a  file  containing  the  current
scan.  It can be run by, for example:

      OUTSCAN OUTFILE=?

It should be pointed out that in a scan,  the  ordinate  (x-axis)  can
include  negative  values,  and that such "spectra" may not be handled
sensibly in some programs.

OUTSPEC,  OUTMEAN,  OUTNET,  OUTSCAN:   The  SPECTYPE   parameter   is
introduced.   SPECTYPE  corresponds  to  the type of file input to the
SPECTRUM or DIPSO programs.  Values 0, 1 and 2 (binary,  fixed  format
and  free  format)  are  available.   This  should  make getting IUEDR
results into other programs much easier than before.

OUTLBLS(NEW):  This command can be used to  output  the  current  LBLS
array to a binary sequential file, as in:

      OUTLBLS OUTFILE=?

The contents of this  file  are  best  described  by  the  Fortran  77
subroutine,  RDLBLS,  and the program, READLB, the source of which can
be found in the directory with Logical Name:

      IUEDR_USER:

The RDLBLS source is  well  commented,  and  can  be  called  directly
(probably  without  change)  from  programs which wish to access these

LBLS files.



13  PLOTTING

PF, PN, PM, PS, PC, PE:  These commands now have additional parameters
which allow control over line styles (solid, dashed, etc.) and colours
(on ARGS only).

The line style is controlled by the LINE and LINEROT parameters.   The
LINE parameter can take on one of the following names:

      SOLID       Solid (continuous) line
      DASH        Dashed line
      DOTDASH     Dot-dash line
      DOT         Dotted line

These line styles represent a cycle which can be used instead  of  (or
as  well as) colour as a means of differentiating several spectra on a
single graph.  To step through the cycle (SOLID, DASH,  DOTDASH,  DOT,
SOLID, DASH, ...) for a particular graph, the LINEROT parameter should
have the value TRUE.  Thus:

      DEVICE=S5670
      LINEROT=TRUE
      PF ORDER=89
      PF ORDER=90,RS=NO

which plots order 89 as a solid line and order 90 as  a  dashed  line.
Alternatively, the initial line style can be chosen explicitly, as in:

      LINEROT=TRUE
      PF ORDER=89,LINE=DASH
      PF ORDER=90,RS=NO

which plots order 89 as a dashed line and order 90 as dot-dashed line.
The  line  style  can,  of course be selected explicitly for each plot
command, using LINE (regardless of LINEROT), as in:

      PF ORDER=89,LINE=DASH
      PF ORDER=90,LINE=SOLID,RS=NO

For a given graph there is a current position in  the  cycle  of  line
styles.    This  is  initially  set  to  SOLID,  although  it  can  be
over-ridden by the LINE parameter.  The rule is that  if  LINEROT=TRUE
then  this current position is changed after plotting to the next line
style.  This behaviour is consistent with the PE and PC commands which
plot more than a single set of points at a time.




                                - 14 -
IUEDR Version 1.2 Release Notes                                Page 15


The colour used for lines within a graph is controlled by the COL  and
COLROT  parameters.   The  effect  of  the (COL,COLROT) combination is
similar to that of (LINE,LINEROT) described above,  and  will  not  be
re-iterated.   The  difference is that COL takes integer values from 1
to  10,  corresponding  to  a  pre-selected  set   of   line   colours
(yellow,green, etc.).  So for example:

      PF ORDER=89,COL=4
      PF ORDER=90,COL=2

will plot order 89 as green and  order  90  as  yellow.   The  initial
defaults for LINEROT and COLROT are:

      LINEROT=FALSE
      COLROT=TRUE

Users not using an ARGS should therefore set LINEROT=TRUE.

PC:  This command now always plots 2 curves.  The first represents the
departure  of  the  spectrum template (as used in spectrum extraction)
from the formal  dispersion  relations.   The  second  represents  the
correction  to  this  template  defined  by  the object signal.  These
curves can be differentiated by line styles and/or colour as described
above.

PF,  PN:   These  commands  now  no  longer  attempt   to   plot   the
"significance"  level  corresponding  to  1  standard deviation in the
background.

PF, PN, PM, PE:  These commands have  a  new  parameter,  HIST,  which
specifies  whether  the  spectra  are  plotted  as  a  histogram.  For
example,

      PF ORDER=89 HIST=YES
      PF ORDER=90,HIST=NO,RS=NO

plots order 89 as a histogram  and  order  90  as  a  poly-line.   The
initial  default  for  HIST=TRUE.   The PS and PC commands always plot
their curves as poly-lines.

PE, PF, PN, PM:  These commands have  a  new  parameter,  QUAL,  which
controls  whether  the data quality information associated with faulty
points is plotted.  The default is QUAL=YES  which  leads  to  symbols
being  plotted at the positions of faulty points in the spectrum.  The
key to these symbols is given in the Manual/HELP text.

Use of QUAL=NO would normally be needed if  the  symbols  from  faulty
points are obscuring the "good" data!

14  IMAGE DISPLAY

DI(NEW):  This command displays the image on the ARGS.  An example is:

      DI  ARGS=IDA0

This is probably the simplest way in which DI  can  be  invoked.   The
ARGS  parameter  can  take one of "IDA0" or "IDB0", according to which
ARGS is to be used.  Note that the ARGS parameter  is  independent  of
the  DEVICE  parameter used by the various spectrum plotting commands.
Thus the sequence:

      PF DEVICE=S5670
      DI ARGS=IDA0
      PF

will produce two plots (in sequence) on  the  S5670  device,  with  an
image  displayed on the ARGS (IDA0).  One problem remains in that when
output is sent to a new device (ARGS  or  DEVICE)  then  the  previous
plots are no longer available for cursor measures etc.

The output from DI can be controlled by the XP, YP and ZL  parameters.
XP and YP specify the pixel subset to be drawn.  If either of XP or YP
are undefined, then the  full  extent  of  the  image  is  adopted  as
default.  An example of specific image display is:

      DI XP=(380,420),YP=(220,180)

which displays  an  expanded  subset  of  the  image.   Note  that  by
reversing  the order of values in YP (as above) you are able to "flip"
the image; XP behaves similarly.  DI expands or compresses  the  image
to fit on the display so that:

      o  Maximum display space is used.

      o  The complete image subset (as specified  by  XP  and  YP)  is
         displayed.

Expansion is performed by duplicating image  pixels.   Compression  is
performed  by averaging adjacent image pixels.  The shape of the image
is always preserved; therefore, it is sensible to keep the XP  and  YP
ranges of a similar size to avoid rather odd shaped pictures.

The image intensities displayed are limited by the values  of  the  ZL
parameter, and relate to picture intensities by:

      ZL(1)     is black
      ZL(2)     is white

Image intensities between ZL(1) and ZL(2) follow a linear  grey-scale.
If  the  ZL  parameter  is  undefined, the full intensity range of the
image  is  displayed.   However,  specific  intensity  ranges  can  be

                                - 16 -
IUEDR Version 1.2 Release Notes                                Page 17


selected, as in:

      DI  ZL=(-1000,1000)

which will  enhance  the  contrast  for  intensities  around  zero  FN
(assuming a GPHOT or PHOT image).  Alternatively:

      DI  ZL=(32000,-2000)

will display a "negative" image (black is  bright,  white  is  faint).
The  FLAG parameter controls whether bad pixels are colour coded (c.f.
QUAL for  plotting  commands).   The  details  of  colour  coding  are
available in the Manual/HELP text.



15  IMAGE EDITING

EI(NEW):  This command allows the data quality of a displayed image to
be  edited  using  the cursor.  The edits affect the user-setable data
quality bit associated with each pixel in the  image.   To  invoke  EI
type:

      EI

The only parameter of significance is TBALL which selects  either  the
Tracker Ball or keyboard as cursor control mechanism.

EI uses the cursor in a similar way to the ES and EM  commands  except
that  both  the  x-  and  y-coordinates of pixels/regions are defined.
(See the EI Manual entry for details).

The data quality for a pixel consists a series of switches  indicating
whether it is affected by various phenomena:

      ITF Extrapolation
      ITF Truncation
      ITF Saturation
      Proximity of fiducial (reseau mark)

These switches cannot be changed;  however,  there  is  an  additional
user-setable  switch for each pixel.  Any pixels affected by the above
phenomena (except ITF extrapolation) have  the  user-switch  set  BAD.
Additional  pixels/regions  can  be  set  BAD  (or  GOOD) using the EI
command.



16  CURSOR COMMANDS

CUL(NEW):  This command uses the cursor to select a subset of  a  plot
or  displayed  image for future plotting or display respectively.  The

                                - 17 -
IUEDR Version 1.2 Release Notes                                Page 18


command consists  two  cursor  hits,  specifying  the  start  and  end
coordinates  of  the  region.   The  sequence of the hits is important
since it allows for the case of reverse limits.

For displayed image, CUL uses its measurements to set values  for  the
XP  and  YP parameters.  For any other plot, it sets values for the XL
and YL parameter.

CU:  This command  now  provides  better  information  about  measured
coordinates and operates on displayed images.



17  OTHERS

SETM:  This  command  now  behaves  slightly  differently  to  before.
Reasonable  default  values  will  be  obtained,  where  possible, for
parameters associated with the specified order.  These can be values:

      o  Previously associated with the order

      o  Generated from a global calibration

The latter are provided to give guidance in cases where some  kind  of
individual  value  is  needed,  but where the actual value needs to be
determined by subsequent experimentation.

A NULL response (the "!" character) to any calibration parameter (i.e.
RIPK,  RIPA,  RIPC,  WCUT)  will lead to the removal of any individual
value associated with the order.

Acceptance of the default leads to retention of that parameter  value.
If  the  value  was  obtained from a global default then no individual
value is associated with  the  order.   Otherwise  and  if  the  value
actually changes, an individual value is stored.

This all sounds complicated, but in essence should behave  "sensibly".
If  in  doubt  as  to what values are retained, use the appropriate SH
command to inspect the calibration(s).

SH:  This command now allows an additional item to be contained in the
V parameter string, as in:

      SH V=C

which shows the  spectrum  templates  currently  associated  with  the
dataset.

18  BATCH JOB SUBMISSION

The "built-in" way of running IUEDR in a VMS Batch Job has  been  made
more  flexible.   Essentially, by invoking IUEDR with a command of the
form:

      $ IUEDR  file  /BATCH

a file "file.JOB" is created containing, essentially:

      $ IUEDR file

and this is supplied to the DCL SUBMIT command to run as a  Batch  Job
in  the  current  directory.   Additional  SUBMIT  qualifiers  can  be
supplied by, for example:

      $ IUEDR  file  /BATCH/QUEUE=SLOW/NOTIFY

Note that "file" is separated from "/BATCH..." by one or more  blanks,
and that the qualifiers should not contain embedded blanks.

To find out more about the DCL SUBMIT command use VMS HELP.   However,
the  /LOGFILE qualifier should not be used, since this file is already
specified as "file.LOG".



19  SCRIPTS

Until now, if parameters used by commands running  in  a  script  were
undefined,  the  command  failed,  and the remainder of the script was
ignored.

It is now possible to run scripts which  will  prompt.   For  example,
suppose to file "TEST.CMD" contains:

      PF
      CU

Assuming that the DATASET parameter is undefined, the command:

      <"TEST.CMD"

will lead to the user being prompted for DATASET before the PF command
completes.  The CU command then runs, requesting cursor inputs.

The commands read  from  a  script  are  now  echoed  on  the  command
terminal.   This  should  make it clearer what is actually being done,
and the  ability  to  be  prompted  when  something  is  undefined  or
unsuitable makes scripts a lot easier to use.

20  PAGE FILE QUOTAS

This version of IUEDR requires less virtual memory (Page  File  Quota)
than  previously.   An implication of this is that larger programs can
be run from within IUEDR, as in:

      @SPECTRUM

which runs Steve Adams' SPECTRUM program from IUEDR.  (The combination
of  IUEDR+SPECTRUM  has  previously  been  excluded  since it required
unreasonable amounts of Page File Quota.)
