                   IUEDR Version 1.1 Release Notes
                   -------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

This Release Note describes changes introduced with IUEDR Version 1.1.
This  version  of  IUEDR represents a correction of 1.0; no additional
commands or facilities are included.



2  LORES ITF CALIBRATION

An error associated  with  the  correction  of  LORES  ITFs  has  been
identified  and  corrected.   The  error  is that, for LORES datasets,
whenever the ".UEC" file is read, the value of ITFCOR  is  left  TRUE.
This  means,  that for LORES images processed with the "3rd" (correct)
ITF, there will be significant "over-correction" of the fluxes.

THIS ERROR WILL LIKELY AFFECT  ALL  SWP  LORES  DATA  THAT  HAVE  BEEN
PROCESSED BY THE GROUND STATION USING THE CORRECT ITF TABLES.

See IUEDRDOC:BUGS for further information.



3  DOCUMENTATION

Two typographical errors appearing in  the  documentation  related  to
ITFMAX  have been corrected.  The errors are in the Table of ITFNs for
the SWP3 (3rd, correct) ITF which appears in Chapter 4, Section  2  of
the  User  Guide,  and  in  the  HELP/MANUAL  entries  for the READIUE
command.  The value "9091" changes to "6783", and "29500" to "28500".
