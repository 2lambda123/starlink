                IUEDR Version 2.0 Notes for Re-release
                --------------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

This Note describes changes made to IUEDR since the  Starlink  release
of  Version  2.0.   This re-release contains bug fixes to the original
release and some modifications to the absolute calibration data files.



2  BUG FIXES

The following bugs in the original release of IUEDR Vn.  2.0 have been
fixed:

      o  CURSOR command would go into an  infinite  cursor  loop  when
         used on spectrum plots.

      o  SGS would produce a zoning error message after a large number
         of plots.

      o  READIUE, READSIPS and LISTIUE would go into an infinite  loop
         if  the  TAPE  parameter was given a device name instead of a
         logical name.

      o  The command line  prompt  would  go  into  an  infinite  loop
         immediately  on  entry  to  IUEDR.   (This  problem  was only
         experienced on LTVAD.)

      o  The HELP for the ITF parameter has been corrected for the SWP
         ITF calibrations available.

3  UPDATES

The format of  the  absolute  calibration  data  files,  available  in
IUEDR_DATA,  has  again  been  changed.  This is to allow the SWP date
sensitivity correction (i.e.   Bohlin  &  Grillmair,  1988.   Ap.   J.
Supp.   Series,  Vol.   68,  487-518)  to  be  included.  The Bohlin &
Grillmair LWR date sensitivity correction is  also  included  in  this
re-release,   in   the  file  IUEDR_DATA:LWRLO1_BG.ABS.   The  Clavel,
Gilmozzi & Prieto (1988.  Astron.  & Astrophys,  Vol.   191,  392-398)
LWR  date  sensitivity  correction  remains  the default.  The command
NEWABS may be used to associate the Bohlin & Grillmair correction with
an IUE LWR dataset instead, if desired.
