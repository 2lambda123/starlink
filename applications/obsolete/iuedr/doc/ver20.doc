                   IUEDR Version 2.0 Release Notes
                   -------------------------------



1  INTRODUCTION

This Note describes changes made to  IUEDR  since  the  last  Starlink
release, Version 1.4.



2  BUG FIXES

No bugs were reported for the last released version of IUEDR.  Several
deficiencies were noted, however, and these have either been rectified
or are to be investigated and rectified in forthcoming versions.



3  UPDATES

This version of IUEDR has some major updates and  a  number  of  minor
changes.  The updates are reviewed below.



3.1  Graphics

Both the graph plotting and image display graphics have been rewritten
to  use  the Starlink recommended NCAR, SNX, SGS and GKS 7.2 packages.
The approach used in the graphics rewrite was to  maintain  the  basic
"flavour"  of the graphics in IUEDR with only minor changes in the use
of the existing  graphics  parameters.   Perhaps  the  most  noticable
change  resulting  from this rewrite is DIPSO-like plotting zones (see
SUN/50 for details) which have been incorporated in  the  program  for
the graph plotting.

Changes in the graph plotting include the ZONE parameter which defines
the plotting zone as follows:

     0 entire display surface
     1 top left quarter
     2 top right quarter
     3 bottom left quater
     4 bottom right quarter
     5 top half
     6 bottom half
     7 left half
     8 right half

By default, the entire  display  surface  is  erased  if  a  requested
plotting  zone will plot over an existing plot.  However, for multiple
plots within one set of drawn axes, the reset flag may  be  set  FALSE
(i.e.  RS=F).  This has the effect of disabling the automatic clearing
of the display for overlapping zones.  If multiple plots are required,
then  the  axes  limits must be set not autoscaled:  i.e.  XL=(x1,x2),
YL=(y1,y2) not XL=!, YL=!.

The image diplay in this version of IUEDR will  only  draw  and  image
with  the  pixel  (1,1) in the bottom left hand corner of the display.
Defining new axes limits using the parameters XP and YP or the  cursor
will  NOT result in a reversal of either axis, regardless of the order
of input.



3.2  FORTRAN Conversion

IUEDR has now been converted into FORTRAN code from the original  AT4.
This  change, although invisible to the user, will hopefully result in
a faster turnaround between versions of the program.  The inclusion of
the FORTRAN source code in future releases is also anticipated.



3.3  Command Names

Two changes  affect  the  names  of  commands  used  in  IUEDR  -  the
implementation  of  shortest  unambiguous command name (e.g.  like the
use of DCL commands)  and  a  rationalisation  of  the  command  names
themselves.   This  version  of  IUEDR  will remind the user if an old
command name is to be withdrawn.   However,  the  command  will  still
work.   The  next release of IUEDR will only provide the user with the
new name for the command and then  return  the  user  to  the  command
prompt.

3.4  New Commands And Parameters

Two new commands have been introduced in this release:  EXIT and  SGS.
EXIT  has  exactly the same function as the QUIT command.  SGS gives a
list of the SGS workstation names available and which may be  used  in
IUEDR  in  response  to  the  DEVICE prompt (see SUN/85 for details of
SGS).

Two new parameters have been introduced  in  this  release:   ITF  and
ZONE.   ITF  is  used  mainly by the command READIUE to obtain the ITF
version used in the photometric calibration of the data.  This  is  of
importance  to  the absolute flux calibration of LORES data.  ZONE has
been discussed above.

Three parameters have been withdrawn:  ARGS, PLOTTER and TBALL.



3.5  Editing Data

Because the IKON image display systems only have three  mouse  buttons
to  control  cursor  functions (the SIGMEX ARGS had four buttons), the
cursor control for the commands EDIMAGE, EDMEAN, EDSPEC  and  MODIMAGE
have  been  changed  slightly.   There  is a full description of their
operation in the IUEDR help system and in the  manual  information  in
the IUEDR_MAN directory.



3.6  Documentation And Online Help

The HELP library for IUEDR has been entirely rebuilt for this version.
It   has  complete  information  available  for  all  commands.   This
information is also available in the command manual in  the  IUEDR_MAN
directory  and  the  global  parameter descriptions in the RUNOFF file
IUEDR_DOC:GLOBAL.RND.     However,    the     user     guide     (i.e.
IUEDR_DOC:GUIDE.RND)  has not yet been updated.  If contradictions are
found between the user guide and the more  recent  documentation,  the
recent documentation is the more correct.



3.7  Other Changes

Two other changes are noteable:  several parameter defaults have  been
changed for the commands READIUE and READSIPS, also the maximum length
of the spectrum array for the  commands  MAP  and  OUTMEAN  have  been
increased  to  27800  points.   The  behaviour of the parameters FILE,
DATASET, CAMERA and IMAGE has been changed for  the  commands  READIUE
and  READSIPS  to  avoid  accidently  reading the same image from tape
twice in succession.  The maximum array length used in  the  execution
of  the commands MAP and OUTMEAN has been changed to enable a complete
long wave HIRES spectrum to be mapped at an interval 0.05A and output.

Several minor changes to IUEDR have also been made.

Please note that IUEDR now requires a  larger  Page  File  Quota  than
previously.   Please  check your Page File Quota using the DCL command
SHOW PROCESS /ALL and consult your Starlink Site Manager if it is less
than 30000 pages.



4  FUTURE

Several further enhancements of the  IUEDR  graphics  system  will  be

released in future versions of the program.

It is noted  that  no  updating  of  the  calibration  data  has  been
performed  for  this  release.   Although this may be inconvenient for
some applications, and certainly needs to be completed at the earliest
opportunity,  the  FORTRAN conversion was considered a higher priority
for this release.  It is hoped that the next release  will  contain  a
complete overhaul of the calibration data.

It is also noted that the bulk of the documentation for IUEDR is still
in  need  of updating.  This is under review and a number of documents
will be released independent of the software releases  in  the  coming
months.

Lastly, I would like to personally apologise to  users  who  may  have
been  inconvenienced  by the long delay in the release of this version
of IUEDR.  It is hoped that now the IUEDR code is in  FORTRAN,  I  can
make full use of the VAXset software productivity tools to shorten the
development time for future versions.
