0 IUEDR

 This is the unix monolith version of IUEDR. There are a number of
 important changes from the VMS version.

   - The session log is stored in session.lis and can be examined using
     more or cat at the shell prompt.
   - To supply a vector parameter on a command line, the components have
     to be enclosed in square brackets, e.g. XL=[1000,1100]
     However, when you are prompted for a vector, the brackets are not
     required.
   - .CMD command files are no longer supported. However, commands may
     be piped into IUEDR.

 For a list of IUEDR commands type ? at the `Topic?' prompt.

 For help on a particular command type its name at the `Topic?' prompt,
 or type HELP name at the `>' prompt.

1 News_IUEDR_3.2-0

 This text describes IUEDR version 3.2-0.
 Fixes to and changes from a previous release (version 3.1-9) are
 described.

 Documentation notes:

  o The IUEDR User Guide (MUD/45) has been comprehensively updated.
  o The IUEDR User Manual (SG/3) has been comprehensively updated.
    The document now has an index, extensive cross-referencing and is
    fully up-to-date with the current release and IUEDR usage.
  o The $IUEDR_USER directory now includes several C shell script
    examples for handling multiple IUE datasets.  Refer to the 
    user.info file in the $IUEDR_USER directory for an outline 
    description.
  o A few errors in the IUEDR Tutorial (SG/7) have been fixed.
  o A few errors and omissions to the help text have been fixed.
  o The out-of-date file global.doc has been removed from the
    $IUEDR_DOC directory.
  o The file problems.doc has been updated to reflect improvements in
    this version of IUEDR.

 Notes on this version:

  o Data in the Calibration file (UEC) are now stored with scale factor 
    edit "1P" where appropriate.  This effectively adds an extra digit
    of precision in these figures.
  o New dispersion (*.dsp) files are available in the $IUEDR_DATA
    directory.  These new relations are used by default.  The old 
    dispersion relations can be employed using the NEWDISP (ironic, I 
    know) command, for example, the action:

       > NEWDISP DISPFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swphi.dsp

    will use the NEW dispersion relations, whereas

       > NEWDISP DISPFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swphi_old.dsp

    will use the OLD dispersion relations.  The new dispersion relations
    are from NASA IUE Newsletter No 51, August 1993.  The old data are
    dated 1982.
  o Command line editing and command history features (identical to those
    in DIPSO) are now available.
    See HELP/Command_line_editing and documentation for more details.
  o A "Hidden" Command CONFIGURE toggles the recording of all parameter
    values for commands in log files.  By default this behaviour is TRUE.
    See HELP/CONFIGURE and documentation for more details.
  o Graph titles now have a consistent style of:

       <OBJECT> (ORDER=<M>)

    for HIRES, and for LORES:

      <OBJECT> (APERTURE=<AP>)

  o The title of pseudo-SP0 format NDFs has been changed to be more
    informative of the contents of the file.
  o A new command CLEAN for marking bad strips of data in IUE images
    has been added.  See HELP/CLEAN, WWW pages or SG/3 for details.
  o A new command AGSHIFT for calculating and setting the GSHIFT parameter
    has been added.  See HELP/AGSHIFT, WWW pages or SG/3 for details.
  o The Plotting area used by PL* commands has been enlarged for most
    SGS zones.
  o Environment Variable style syntax has been added to file name loading,
    previously Logical Names and/or explicit files only were supported.
  o Support for Calibration, fiducial etc. file loading has been
    rationalised and documented.
  o Program output redirection is now possible.
    When using

       % iuedr < script_file

    the default log file session.lis is produced.

       % iuedr < script_file > script_log.lis

    will produce the log file script_log.lis INSTEAD OF session.lis
  o For TRAK the case EXTENDED=TRUE CONTINUUM=FALSE now prompts for
    BSLIT as it should.
  o The NULL parameter response can now be used as advertised in the
    manual.  It should be noted that the meaning of a NULL response is

       "use suitable defaults this time"

    For example, if XP=[200,400] and a NULL response to a prompt for XP
    (from DRIMAGE) is given then XP=[1,768] will be used, but the values
    [200,400] will be retained for subsequent DRIMAGE invocations.
  o The maximum number of pseudo-orders allowed in LBLS has been increased
    from 55 to 120 to reflect changes in the default values of GSAMP and
    RSAMP.
  o The EXIT command no longer need be present in IUEDR scripts.

 Bug fixes:

  o When Image Data Quality is altered the Data and Quality file is marked
    as required for update.  Previously this only occurred for Data
    alteration.
  o An error in SETD OBJECT which made it impossible to change the case of
    letters in the OBJECT field has been removed.
  o A small bug in the use of the NORDER parameter for HIRES TRAK, where
    the extraction would over-run the available order range has been fixed.
  o LISTIUE will process multiple files on a tape and does not re-prompt
    for FILE number.
  o A bug in the reading of fiducial positions leading to problems
    TRAKing HIRES data has been removed.
  o An error translating all environment variables returned by PSX_GETENV
    in data file reading to lower case has been removed.
  o Incorrect FWHM values written to SCAN plots, output files and listings
    have been fixed.  The SCAN subroutine for HIRES has been modified to
    use the correct FWHM rather than HWHM.  Documentation for SCANAV which
    is the HALF WHM not FWHM (as documented before) has been changed.
  o Missing parameter definitions of APERTURE for the SCAN and MAP commands
    have been added to the interface file.  The On-line help and SG/3 have
    been corrected also.
  o Titles in the PRSCAN command have been changed for HIRES so that the
    SCANDIST parameter is correctly labelled.
  o A small error in the case of failed attempts to read _UEM files has
    been corrected.  These do not produce NDF errors, rather a simple
    "not available" message.  This applies to the SHOW command.
  o A bug in the writing of Ripple correction data for Sun hosted systems
    has been fixed.  This bug precluded the use of the BARKER command on
    such machines.
  o A bug causing SGS zones to fall over when an out-of-range zone was
    chosen has been removed.

1 Accessing_data_via_NFS
 UNIX machines commonly provide disk sharing amongst remote machines
 using the NFS protocol.

For example your data frame may reside on a DECstation local
disk called `iuedata' in the Rutherford cluster on machine `adam4'.
In order to get IUEDR to read it directly you could enter the
following in response to the DRIVE prompt :

      DRIVE> /adam4/iuedata/swp12345.raw

To see which disks you have NFS access to you should use the

      df

command. In general any disks whose entry does not start with a `/dev'
are being served by a remote machine.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

IUEDR allows you to use this method of
data access with the following proviso.

If the data resides on a VAX served disk then you must first
convert its directory entry using the following command :

      UNIX_FORMAT  image-name

This command does not change the data in any way. It merely alters
the description of the file format as stored in the VAX directory.

If at some later stage you wish to use the VAX version of IUEDR on
the same data file it first be necessary to use the command

      VAX_FORMAT  image-name

to convert back.

1 AESHIFT
 Determine echelle shift by measuring shifts for several absorption line
 features in a HIRES image.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   CENTREWAVE      Line central wavelengths (A).
   DELTAWAVE       Half-width of line search windows (A).

2 Full
AESHIFT can  be  used to  measure the  global echelle  shift for a HIRES
spectrum.  A set of laboratory wavelengths of absorption features  which
should be  present in the  spectrum are located  in the spectrum and the
ESHIFT for each of them is found.   The median value of these ESHIFTs is
then selected and used for the whole dataset.

2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 CENTREWAVE=number[,number...]
These are the  laboratory wavelengths of a set of absorption features in
the spectrum to be used to estimate a value for the ESHIFT parameter.
2 DELTAWAVE=number[,number...]
The  half-width  of the  window used  to search  for an  absorption line
feature for  wavelength calibration in Angstroms.  If more than one line
is being used then each may be given a different search window width.
1 AGSHIFT
 Determine spectrum shift automatically.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   APERTURE        Aperture name (SAP or LAP).
   ORDERS          This delineates a range of Echelle orders.

2 Full
AGSHIFT  can be  used to measure the global geometric shift  for a
spectrum.  A scan of the DATASET must  be made available using the SCAN
command.

For HIRES data, the  scan is traversed starting with the lowest-numbered
order and a probable site for the peak of each order is found.  The cen-
tral position of  each order is then estimated using a centroiding algo-
rithm.   An estimate of the geometric  shift is made for  each order and
these are recorded and displayed.

A weighted mean  in which the shifts  determined for orders  100 to  110
inclusive are given greater weight than other shifts is then calculated.
The mean shift is displayed and the GSHIFT parameter is set.

Using AGSHIFT it is possible to automate the spectrum extraction process
for  many datasets.   It should be noted that  objects with no continuum
may break the AGSHIFT mechanism, giving poor shift values.

2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 APERTURE=name
This is the name of an individual aperture.  The following names have
defined meanings:

      SAP       IUE Small Aperture
      LAP       IUE Large Aperture

Other apertures names may also be defined.
2 ORDERS=number[,number]
This is a pair of Echelle order numbers delineating a range.  If only  a
single value is specified, then the range consists that order only.  The
"order" of the number pair is not significant.
1 BARKER
 The spectrum data in DATASET are corrected for echelle ripple in the
 range ORDERS using the method of Barker (1984).

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   ORDERS          This delineates a range of Echelle orders.

2 Full
The spectrum data in DATASET are corrected for residual  echelle  ripple
using  the  method  described  by  Barker (1984.  Astronomical  Journal,
Vol. 89,  899).  Orders in  the  range  ORDERS  are  used  in the ripple
correction  optimisation.  Note  that  this  optimisation method is only
applicable for SWP spectra.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 ORDERS=number[,number]
This is a pair of Echelle order numbers delineating a range.  If only  a
single value is specified, then the range consists that order only.  The
"order" of the number pair is not significant.
1 CGSHIFT
 Determine spectrum shift using cursor on a scan plot.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   APERTURE        Aperture name (SAP or LAP).
   ORDERS          This delineates a range of Echelle orders.
   DEVICE          GKS/SGS graphics device name.

2 Full
This  command  allows  the  graphics  cursor  to  be  used  to   provide
information about spectrum registration shifts.

A plot of the current spectrum scan must be made available using PLSCAN.
A cycle consisting of any  number of left or middle mouse button hits is
used to mark the position of the spectrum. Each hit is used to calculate
a linear geometric shift of the spectrum template relative to the image.
The cycle is terminated by pressing the right mouse button.

Keyboard keys 1, 2 and 3 can be used  in place of left, middle and right
mouse buttons respectively.

For LORES, when the cycle is complete, the last geometric shift deter-
mined is adopted, and the scan is revoked.

For HIRES, each cursor  hit is automatically associated  with an Echelle
order in  the range defined by the ORDERS parameter.  The last shift  is
again adopted, but the scan is available for further display or measure-
ment.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 APERTURE=name
This is the name of an individual aperture.  The following names have
defined meanings:

      SAP       IUE Small Aperture
      LAP       IUE Large Aperture

Other apertures names may also be defined.
2 ORDERS=number[,number]
This is a pair of Echelle order numbers delineating a range.  If only  a
single value is specified, then the range consists that order only.  The
"order" of the number pair is not significant.
2 DEVICE=name
This  is  the  GKS/SGS  graphics  device.   A  list  of   possible  GKS
workstations may  be  found in SUN/83.  A list of SGS workstation names
available at your site may be obtained either by a null response to the
DEVICE parameter prompt (i.e.  "!"), or by using the IUEDR command SGS.
1 CLEAN
 This command is used to mark pixels with values below a selected
 threshold as BAD.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   THRESH          Smallest pixel value to be accepted as GOOD.

2 Full
Some IUE  datasets are effected  by horizontal  bars of low pixel values.
These are caused by a weak  signal from the IUE craft at the time of data
download.  When there are  a few bars  they can be marked as bad with the
EDIMAGE command.  In the case of many bars a quicker solution is to mark
all  pixels in  the image below  a user selected  threshold value as BAD.

Successive  CLEAN and DRIMAGE commands starting with a value of THRESH as
-1000 and increasing THRESH  towards zero will  allow the user to chose a
value suitable for the problem image.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 THRESH=value
This is the  minimum value considered to be good.  All pixels with values
below this threshold will be marked BAD.
1 Command_files
The .CMD style of IUEDR command files is no longer supported. Instead
commands can be piped into iuedr:

    % iuedr < proc.cmd

It is very easy to convert an old .CMD file into the new format:

E.g., DEMO.CMD procedure

   DATASET=SWP03196
   SHOW
   ORDERS=(125,66)
   SCAN
   TRAK APERTURE=LAP
   SHOW V=S

would become the script

   SHOW DATASET=SWP03196
   SCAN ORDERS=[125,66]
   TRAK APERTURE=LAP
   SHOW V=S

The only changes which need be made are to move any parameter specifi-
cations (eg DATASET=) onto the same line as they command they apply to,
and to change the round () brackets for vector parameters to square []
brackets.
1 Command_line_editing
Command line editing features are available in IUEDR as follows:

    cursor up           - recall previous command in history list.
    cursor down         - recall next command in history list.
    cursor left         - move cursor left on line.
    cursor right        - move cursor right on line.
    backspace or delete - Delete character under cursor and shift
                          remaining string left to fill the gap.
    control-u           - Delete the current line.
    control-a           - Jump to start of line.
    control-e           - Jump to end of line.
    control-n           - Toggle overstrike/insert mode.

IUEDR will record up to 32 commands  which may  be recalled using the up
cursor key.
1 CONFIGURE
 Toggles recording of parameter values in the log file.

2 Full
This command  toggles  the  writing of  all parameter  values to the log
file.   By default  this behaviour  is TRUE and a full log is made,  for
example:

> drimage
 DATASET='SWP14931'.
 Reading SWP14931.UEC (Calibration File).
 Reading SWP14931_UED (Image & Quality File).
 COLOUR=FALSE.
 DEVICE='xw'.
 FLAG=TRUE.
 XP=[0,0].
 YP=[0,0].
 ZL=[0.0000,0.0000].

When parameter logging is switched off the same command produces only:

> drimage
 Reading SWP14931.UEC (Calibration File).
 Reading SWP14931_UED (Image & Quality File).

in the log file.
1 CULIMITS
 This command allows the display limits to be delineated by the cursor
 and the appropriate parameters set accordingly.

   DEVICE          GKS/SGS graphics device name.
   XL              X-axis plotting limits.  [0,0] means auto-scale.
   YL              Y-axis plotting limits.  [0,0] means auto-scale.
   XP              X-axis pixel limits, undefined means full extent.
   YP              Y-axis pixel limits, undefined means full extent.

2 Full
This command lets the cursor be used to  delineate  part  of  a  current
display (graph/picture) to be displayed in some subsequent command (e.g.
DRIMAGE, PLFLUX).

The two cursor positions  should be at the corners of the required rect-
angular subset.  The relation between cursor position sequences and axis
reversals for graphs is:

      position 1    position 2    x-reversed    y-reversed

      bottom/left   top/right         NO           NO
      bottom/right  top/left          YES          NO
      top/left      bottom/right      NO           YES
      top/right     bottom/left       YES          YES

The XL and YL values are changed accordingly.  In the case of  an  image
display,  the  XP  and  YP parameter values are changed.  The image will
ALWAYS be drawn without axis reversals.
2 DEVICE=name
This  is  the  GKS/SGS  graphics  device.   A  list  of   possible  GKS
workstations may  be  found in SUN/83.  A list of SGS workstation names
available at your site may be obtained either by a null response to the
DEVICE parameter prompt (i.e.  "!"), or by using the IUEDR command SGS.
2 XL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  x-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes
are being redrawn.  If both values are the same (e.g.  [0,0]), then  the
data  limits  in  the x-direction will be determined from the data being
plotted.
2 YL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  y-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes
are being redrawn.  If both values are the same (e.g.  [0,0]), then  the
data  limits  in  the y-direction will be determined from the data being
plotted.
2 XP=number,number
This specifies the pixel limits along the  x-direction  used  for  image
display.  Values in decreasing order will cause the image to be inverted
along the x-direction.  If the values are undefined,  the  pixel  limits
will  default  to  include  the  whole  extent  of  the  image along the
x-direction.
2 YP=number,number
This specifies the pixel limits along the  y-direction  used  for  image
display.  Values in decreasing order will cause the image to be inverted
along the y-direction.  If the values are undefined,  the  pixel  limits
will  default  to  include  the  whole  extent  of  the  image along the
y-direction.
1 CURSOR
 Find display coordinate using the cursor and print on terminal.

2 Full
This command uses the graphics cursor to mark positions  on  a  diagram.
The diagram can be either a plot or a displayed image.

Pressing the left or middle  mouse button displays information about the
pixel being  pointed to.  Pressing the right mouse button terminates the
CURSOR cycle.  The coordinates for each hit are printed on the terminal;
they correspond to the unit scale of the axes prevailing  on the current
diagram,  e.g. wavelength,  flux.  If meaningful,  additional coordinate
information is also printed.
1 DRIMAGE
 Display image on an image display device.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   DEVICE          GKS/SGS graphics device name.
   XP              X-axis pixel limits, undefined means full extent.
   YP              Y-axis pixel limits, undefined means full extent.
   ZL              Data limits for image display, undefined  means  full
                   range.
   COLOUR          Whether a false colour look-up table  is used for the
                   display.
   ZONE            Zone to be used for plotting.
   FLAG            Whether data quality for faulty pixels is displayed.

2 Full
This command displays the image, specified by the DATASET parameter,  on
the device specified by the DEVICE parameter.

The part of the  image displayed is specified by the XP and YP parameter
values.  If unspecified,XP and YP default to the entire image extent:

   XP=[1,768], YP=[1,768]

If the values of XP or YP are specified in  decreasing  order, then  the
image will NOT be reversed along the appropriate axis.

The range  of data values displayed (as a grey scale) is limited  by the
two values of the ZL parameter.  Data values at ZL(1) will appear BLACK,
whilst those at ZL(2) will appear WHITE.  If the ZL values are given  in
decreasing  order,  then high data  values  will be  represented  by low
(dark)  display intensities,  and vice-versa.   If the values are undef-
ined, then the full intensity range of the image will be used.

Data values which  fall below the  lowest display intensity are drawn in
BLACK,  while  those  which fall above the highest display intensity are
drawn BLUE.  If COLOUR=TRUE then a false colour look-up table is used
instead.

The FLAG parameter specifies  whether faulty  pixels  are  flagged using
the following colour scheme:

      GREEN       pixels affected by reseau marks
      RED         pixels which are saturated (DN=255)
      ORANGE      pixels affected by ITF truncation
      YELLOW      pixels marked bad by the user

If a pixel is affected by more than one of the above  faults,  then  the
first in the list is adopted for display.

The ZONE parameter  is accepted  by DRIMAGE but is ignored,  the display 
always using using ZONE=0.

2 COLOUR=boolean

 If COLOUR=TRUE then a false colour look-up table is used to derive
 pixel colours.  Otherwise a greyscale is used.

2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 DEVICE=name
This  is  the  GKS/SGS  graphics  device.   A  list  of   possible  GKS
workstations may  be  found in SUN/83.  A list of SGS workstation names
available at your site may be obtained either by a null response to the
DEVICE parameter prompt (i.e.  "!"), or by using the IUEDR command SGS.
2 FLAG=boolean
This specifies whether the data quality information is  displayed  along
with  the image.  If so, then faulty pixels will be marked with a colour
according to the following scheme:

      GREEN       pixels affected by reseau marks
      RED         pixels which are saturated (DN=255)
      ORANGE      pixels affected by ITF truncation
      YELLOW      pixels marked bad by the user

User edits are only shown where no other fault is present.

This option  would normally only  be used when assessing the  quality of
faulty pixels, possible  with a view to  using them (marking them "good"
with a cursor editor).
2 XP=number,number
This specifies the pixel limits along the  x-direction  used  for  image
display.  Values in decreasing order will cause the image to be inverted
along the x-direction.  If the values are undefined,  the  pixel  limits
will  default  to  include  the  whole  extent  of  the  image along the
x-direction.
2 YP=number,number
This specifies the pixel limits along the  y-direction  used  for  image
display.  Values in decreasing order will cause the image to be inverted
along the y-direction.  If the values are undefined,  the  pixel  limits
will  default  to  include  the  whole  extent  of  the  image along the
y-direction.
2 ZL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used  for  display  of  images.   If  the
values  are  given  in  decreasing  order, then high data values will be
represented by low (dark) display intensities, and vice-versa.   If  the
values are undefined, then the full intensity range of the image will be
used.

Data values which  fall below the lowest  display intensity are drawn in
BLACK,  while  those  which fall above the highest display intensity are
drawn BLUE.
2 ZONE=number
This specifies the zone to be used for plotting.  The zone numbers range
from  0  to  8  and  correspond to those defined by the TZONE command in
DIPSO (see SUN/50):

     0 entire display surface
     1 top left quarter
     2 top right quarter
     3 bottom left quarter
     4 bottom right quarter
     5 top half
     6 bottom half
     7 left half
     8 right half
1 Drive_specifiers

The use of the DRIVE parameter has been enhanced to allow specification
of disk files containing IUE datasets.  This is intended for use with
files obtained from online archives (RAL and NASA).

The syntax is to provide the full filename and extension in response to
the DRIVE prompt.

E.g.
      DRIVE> SWP12345.RAW
1 EDIMAGE
 Edit image data quality using image display cursor.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   DEVICE          GKS/SGS graphics device name.

2 Full
This command allows the image display cursor to be used to  mark  pixels
and  regions  of  the current image that are "bad" or "good".  The image
should have previously been displayed using  the  DRIMAGE  command.   So
that faulty pixels can be seen, the FLAG=YES option in DRIMAGE should be
used.

The image display is specified by the  DEVICE parameter, and the associ-
ated dataset by the DATASET parameter.

The following cursor hit sequences can be used in a cycle:

      1  then  1    marks all pixels in the rectangle GOOD
      2  then  2    marks all points in the rectangle BAD
      1             marks the nearest pixel GOOD
      2             marks the nearest pixel BAD
      3             causes the cursor cycle to terminate

Mouse buttons can be used for cursor hits where:

      left button     is  hit 1
      middle button   is  hit 2
      right button    is  hit 3

Alternatively, keyboard keys 1, 2 and 3 can be used to mark hits.

The pixels/ranges  changed  are  printed  on  the  terminal.   The  term
"rectangle"  is  used  above  to  indicate  a  rectangular set of pixels
delineated by the two cursor positions.  Thus, for the  first  hit,  the
cursor  can  be positioned at the bottom left corner, and for the second
at the top right corner.

Only the user-defined data quality bit can be changed with this command.
Initially, all  faulty pixels  have this bit set BAD, so  that spectrum
extraction can ignore these where appropriate.  However, the user-
defined data quality can be set GOOD.

See the User Guide (MUD/45) for further information on "data quality".

   APERTURE        Aperture name (SAP or LAP).
   DEVICE          GKS/SGS graphics device name.

2 Full
This command allows the graphics cursor to be used to  mark  points  and
regions of the current net spectrum that are "bad" or "good".  A plot of
the APERTURE or ORDER spectrum is required before this  command  can  be
used.

The following cursor hit sequences can be used in a cycle:

      middle button   is  hit 2
      right button    is  hit 3

Alternatively, keyboard keys 1, 2 and 3 can be used to mark hits.


Only the user-defined data quality bit can be changed with this command.
Initially, all faulty points have this bit set BAD (e.g. by TRAK).  How-
ever,  whether they  are considered bad (e.g. when plotting  or creating
output  files)  is determined  by the  user-defined  bit,  which  can be
changed at will.

See the User Guide (MUD/45) for further information on "data quality".

1 EXIT
 Leaves IUEDR and returns to the command shell.

2 Full
This command leaves the IUEDR programme and returns to the shell from which it 
was started.  Any data files which require update will be written by this
command.  The command is a synonym for the QUIT command.

Note that the existing files for the current dataset are overwritten.
1 Help
 This is the IUEDR on-line HELP facility.  It operates just like the VMS
 Help Facility.  It contains entries of the following kind:

    a) Commands (depicted by all UPPER CASE names).

    b) Parameter Information (under "Parameters").

    c) Related Information (depicted by a Capital first letter).
1 IUEDR

 This is the unix monolith version of IUEDR. There are a number of
 important changes from the VMS version.

   - The session log is stored in session.lis and can be examined using
     more or cat at the shell prompt.
   - To supply a vector parameter on a command line, the components have
     to be enclosed in square brackets, e.g. XL=[1000,1100]
     However, when you are prompted for a vector, the brackets are not
     required.
   - .CMD command files are no longer supported. However, commands may
     be piped into IUEDR.

 For a list of IUEDR commands type ? at the `Topic?' prompt.

 For help on a particular command type its name at the `Topic?' prompt,
 or type HELP name at the `>' prompt.

1 LBLS
 This extracts a line-by-line-spectrum (LBLS) array from the image.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   ORDER           Echelle order number.
   APERTURE        Aperture name (SAP or LAP).
   CENTM           Whether pre-existing centroid template is used.
   CUTWV           Whether wavelength cutoff data is used for extraction
                   grid.
   GSAMP           Spectrum grid sampling rate (geometric pixels).
   RL              Limits across spectrum for LBLS array (pixels).
   RSAMP           Radial coordinate sampling rate  for   LBLS   grid in
                   pixels.

2 Full
This command creates  a  line-by-line-spectrum  (LBLS)  array  from  the
image.   The  array  consists  intensities  F(IR,  IW)  for  a  grid  of
wavelengths, W(IW), and radial coordinates, R(IR).

The wavelength grid, W, is determined in a similar way to the TRAK comm-
and, and involves the CUTWV (HIRES) and GSAMP (HIRES/LORES) parameters.

The  radial coordinates are  distances from the  centre of  the spectrum
along a line perpendicular to the dispersion direction, and  measured in
geometric pixels.  The radial grid, R, is determined by the RL and RSAMP
parameters.

The value of each pixel in the array  corresponds  to  the  surface over
the image of  a rectangle centred on its (R, W) coordinates, and extents
(R(IR) - DR / 2, R(IR) + DR / 2) and (W(IW) - DW / 2, W(IW)  +  DW / 2).
DR is the distance between R values, and DW is the wavelength step bet-
ween W values.

This surface integral is  scaled along the W direction  to correspond to
an  interval of 1.414 geometric pixels.  The reason for  this is to make
LBLS intensities  consistent with  those  produced  by the TRAK command.
For a particular wavelength,  W(IW), the sum  of LBLS intensities (after
removal of  background) should correspond to the Net flux as measured by
TRAK.
2 APERTURE=name
This is the name of an individual aperture.  The following names have
defined meanings:

      SAP       IUE Small Aperture
      LAP       IUE Large Aperture

Other apertures names may also be defined.
2 CENTM=boolean
This indicates whether a centroid template from the calibration  dataset
is  used  as  a  start  in defining the precise position of the spectrum
signal on the image.

There is no guarantee that such a template will be available in a parti-
cular situation (camera/aperture/resolution/order).
2 CUTWV=boolean
This indicates whether any available  Echelle  order  wavelength  cutoff
limits  are  to  be  used  for  the  spectrum extraction wavelength grid
limits.  Highly recommended, provided that  you  are  happy  with  these
wavelength limits.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 GSAMP=number
This is the sampling rate used for spectrum extraction.  It is  measured
in  "geometric pixels".  GSAMP=1.414 corresponds to the original IUESIPS
(1) sampling rate,  while GSAMP=0.707 corresponds  to  the later IUESIPS
(2) sampling rate.  Other values can be chosen.
2 ORDER=number
This is the Echelle order number.
2 RL=number,number
This is a pair of radial coordinate values defining the start and end of
the radial grid in an LBLS array.  These radial coordinates are measured
in geometric pixels, and run perpendicular to the dispersion  direction.
A coordinate of 0.0 corresponds to the centre of the spectrum.

Values of [0.0,0.0] indicate that internal defaults are to be adopted.
A single value is reflected symmetrically about 0.0.
2 RSAMP=number
This is the sample spacing used for the radial grid in the  LBLS  array.
If it does not fit an integral number of times into the grid limits, RL,
then the latter are adjusted to fit.

Suggested values range from 0.707 to 1.414 pixels; the latter correspon-
ding to the IUESIPS LBLS grid.
1 LISTIUE
 Analyse the contents of one or more IUE tape files.

   DRIVE           Tape Drive or File Name.
   FILE            File Number.
   NFILE           Number of Tape Files to be processed.
   NLINE           Number of IUE header lines printed.
   SKIPNEXT        Whether skip to next file.

2 Full
This performs an analysis of NFILE IUE  tape  files,  starting  at  file
specified  by  the  FILE  parameter.  NFILE=-1 means all files until the
end of the tape.   This can also be used to display the header data from
a GO format disk file.
2 DRIVE=name
This the device name of the Tape Drive.  Feasible values are
/dev/nrmt0h on a unix machine or MSA0 on a VMS machine.
Other values may apply, check with your system manager.

Alternatively, a filename may be given. If the filename
contains a directory specification it should be placed in
single quotes.
2 FILE=number
This is the Tape File Number.  The first file on a tape would be FILE=1.
One case  which may present  some problems is  that of  a tape with a an
End-of-volume (EOV) mark in the middle, and valuable  data  beyond.   An
EOV  is  two  consecutive Tape Marks (sometimes called "File Marks").  A
File is defined, here, as the information between two Tape Marks.  So if
the number for a (real) file before EOV is FILEN, then the number of the
next (real) file following the EOV is (FILEN+2).
2 NFILE=number
This is the number of tape files to be processed.  A value of "-1" means
all files until the end.
2 NLINE=number
This is the number of IUE header  lines  printed.   NLINE=-1  means  the
entire header is printed.
2 SKIPNEXT=boolean
This determines whether the tape is positioned at the start of the  next
file  after processing.  If only the start of a file is being processed,
then by setting SKIPNEXT=FALSE, time can be saved.
1 MAP
 Map and merge spectrum components to produce a mean spectrum.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   ORDERS          This delineates a range of Echelle orders.
   APERTURE        Aperture name (SAP or LAP).
   RM              Whether mean spectrum is reset before averaging.
   ML              Wavelength grid limits for mean spectrum.
   MSAMP           Wavelength sampling rate for mean spectrum grid.
   FILLGAP         Whether gaps can be filled within order.
   COVERGAP        Whether gaps can be filled by covering orders.

2 Full
This command can be used to produce a mean spectrum  with  contributions
from several Echelle orders (HIRES), or from several apertures (LORES).

If RM=TRUE, or if there is no existing  mean  spectrum,  then  an evenly
spaced wavelength  grid  is  constructed  between  the  limits specified
by the ML parameter, and using the sampling rate specified  by the MSAMP
parameter.

If RM=FALSE and there IS an existing mean spectrum, then the  wavelength
grid AND CONTENTS  are retained.  New components  will be  averaged with
what is already there.

In the case of HIRES, the ORDERS parameter is used to delimit  the range
of echelle orders that are allowed to contribute to the mean.

In the case of LORES only a single  aperture, specified by  the APERTURE
parameter, is mapped at a given time.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 ORDERS=number[,number]
This is a pair of Echelle order numbers delineating a range.  If only  a
single value is specified, then the range consists that order only.  The
"order" of the number pair is not significant.
2 APERTURE=name
This is the name of an individual aperture.  The following names have
defined meanings:

      SAP       IUE Small Aperture
      LAP       IUE Large Aperture

Other apertures names may also be defined.
2 RM=boolean
This determines whether the mean spectrum  is  reset  before  a  mapping
takes  place.   If  the  spectrum  is  not reset, then the spectra being
mapped will be averaged with the existing net spectrum.
2 ML=number,number
This is a pair of wavelength values defining the start and  end  of  the
mean spectrum grid.  The grid will  consist of Vacuum Wavelengths evenly
spaced between these values.
2 MSAMP=number
This is the (Vacuum) wavelength sampling  rate  for  the  mean  spectrum
grid.   If  it  does  not  fit an integral number of times into the grid
limits, then the latter are adjusted to fit.
2 FILLGAP=boolean
If a grid point in the mean spectrum would have had a contribution  from
a  bad  data point, this parameter determines whether that grid point is
marked as  unusable within  the context  of the order  or aperture being
mapped.  If the grid point is marked  as unusable in this way then other
(good) points cannot contribute to it.
2 COVERGAP=boolean
If after mapping an order/aperture, a grid point is marked as  unusable,
then  this  parameter  determines  whether other orders/apertures can be
allowed to contribute to this grid point.
1 MODIMAGE
 Modifies actual image intensities interactively.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   DEVICE          GKS/SGS graphics device name.
   FN              Replacement Flux Number for pixel

2 Full
This command allows the image display cursor to be used to modify  image
data.   The  image  should already have been displayed using the DRIMAGE
command.

The following cursor sequences are adopted:

      1 then 2        Copy intensity of first picked pixel to the second
      2               Prompt for replacement pixel intensity
      3               Finish

Mouse buttons can be used for cursor hits where:

      left button     is  hit 1
      middle button   is  hit 2
      right button    is  hit 3

Alternatively, keyboard keys 1, 2 and 3 can be used to mark hits.

If the data and/or quality changes after a session, the file is saved on
disk.

The assumption is made that  the current image  displayed corresponds to
the current dataset!
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 DEVICE=name
This  is  the  GKS/SGS  graphics  device.   A  list  of   possible  GKS
workstations may  be  found in SUN/83.  A list of SGS workstation names
available at your site may be obtained either by a null response to the
DEVICE parameter prompt (i.e.  "!"), or by using the IUEDR command SGS.
2 FN=number
This parameter is the  replacement  Flux  Number  for  a  pixel  changed
explicitly by the user.

/dev/nrmt0h on a unix machine or MSA0 on a VMS machine.
Other values may apply, check with your system manager.
2 FILE=number
This is the Tape File Number.  The first file on a tape would be FILE=1.
One case  which may present  some problems is  that of  a tape with a an
End-of-volume (EOV) mark in the middle, and valuable  data  beyond.   An
EOV  is  two  consecutive Tape Marks (sometimes called "File Marks").  A
File is defined, here, as the information between two Tape Marks.  So if
the number for a (real) file before EOV is FILEN, then the number of the
next (real) file following the EOV is (FILEN+2).
1 MTREW
 Rewind tape.

   DRIVE           Tape Drive Name.

2 Full
This command rewinds the tape specified by the DRIVE parameter.

1 MTSKIPEOV
 Skip over EOV mark.

   DRIVE           Tape Drive Name.

2 Full
This command skips over an EOV mark on the tape specified by  the  DRIVE
parameter.   An  EOV  condition  is where there are two consecutive tape
marks.  When attempting to skip across an EOV, an error will be reported
and the tape left positioned between the two marks.  Subsequent attempts
to skip forward will fail, and only this command can  be  used  to  move
forward beyond the second tape mark.
2 DRIVE=name
This the device name of the Tape Drive.  Feasible values are
/dev/nrmt0h on a unix machine or MSA0 on a VMS machine.
Other values may apply, check with your system manager.

   DRIVE           Tape Drive Logical Name.
   NSKIP           Number of Tape Marks to be skipped over.

2 Full
This command skips over NSKIP tape marks on the tape  specified  by  the
DRIVE  parameter.   If  NSKIP is negative this means that tape marks are
skipped in the reverse direction (towards the start of the tape).
2 DRIVE=name
This the device name of the Tape Drive.  Feasible values are
/dev/nrmt0h on a unix machine or MSA0 on a VMS machine.
Other values may apply, check with your system manager.

The format of this file is described by the Fortran 77 routine,  RDLBLS,
which can be found in the file:

      $IUEDR_USER/rdlbls.for

this directory (environment variable $IUEDR_USER) also contains  a  test
program for using RDLBLS, and other helpful items.
2 DATASET=filename

   SPECTYPE        "SPECTRUM" file type (0, 1 or 2).

2 Full
This command outputs the mean spectrum associated with DATASET to a file
that can be read into DIPSO (see SUN/50).

This file is created with type specified by the SPECTYPE  parameter (see
SUN/50 for SP options),  and its name, if not specified, is constructed:

      <CAMERA><IMAGE>M.sdf    for SP0
      <CAMERA><IMAGE>M.DAT    for SP1 or SP2

In DIPSO SP format, bad points are indicated by having zero intensities.
In determining which  points in the output  file are to be marked "bad",
the user-defined data quality bit is used.  Since this bit can be arbit-
rarily  edited,  faulty  data values can be  written to the output file,
without subsequent information being retained.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 OUTFILE=string
This is the name of a file to receive the output spectrum.
2 SPECTYPE=number
This is the type of file (in the terminology of Steve Adams old SPECTRUM
program), to be created.  The following values are allowed:

      0       Starlink standard NDF
      1       Fixed format file
      2       Free format file

It is recommended  that  datasets  with  many  points  be  written  with
SPECTYPE=0,  which  is  more  efficient  in  disk  space  and time spent
reading/writing.

It should be noted  that files created  with any of these formats can be
read into the DIPSO program (Maslen/Howarth, UCL, see SUN/50).

or index, and <ORDER> is the echelle order number.

In DIPSO SP format, bad points are indicated by having zero intensities.
In determining which  points in the output  file are to be marked "bad",
the user-defined data quality bit is used.  Since this bit can be arbit-
rarily  edited,  faulty  data values can be  written to the output file,
without subsequent information being retained.

to  a  formatted  file  that  is  compatible with output from the "TRAK"
program.  The default file name is of the form:

      <CAMERA><IMAGE>.TRK

The main difference from an actual "TRAK" file is  that  the  background
level is uniformly zero, so that GROSS=NET.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.

1 Parameters
 The following is a list of all the parameters available to IUEDR commands.

2 ABSFILE=string
This is the name of a file containing an absolute flux  calibration.
A  type of ".abs" is assumed, and need not be specified explicitly.

An environment variable may be used or pre-pended to the filename,
for example to load the supplied calibration file for the SWP camera
HIRES mode:

   > NEWABS ABSFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swphi
2 APERTURE=name
This is the name of an individual aperture.  The following names have
defined meanings:

      SAP       IUE Small Aperture
      LAP       IUE Large Aperture

Other apertures names may also be defined.
2 APERTURES=name
This specifies an aperture or group of apertures.  The  following  names
have defined meanings:

      SAP       IUE Small Aperture
      LAP       IUE Large Aperture
      BAP       IUE Both Apertures (i.e. SAP and LAP)
2 AUTOSLIT=boolean
This determines whether the extraction slit is determined  automatically
by the command.  When AUTOSLIT=TRUE the BDIST, BSLIT and GSLIT parameter
values  are  determined  automatically,  based  on   the   IUE   Camera,
Resolution,  Aperture,  and  on the values of the CONTINUUM and EXTENDED
parameters.  This mode of operation  is  probably  the  best  for  point
source objects.
2 BADITF=boolean
This parameter determines whether a correction  is  made  to  the  pixel
intensities to account for errors during Ground Station ITF calibration.
(Note  that  the  best  scientific  results  would  be   obtained   from
reprocessed  data which can be obtained on request.) The following cases
are handled:

      SWP,LORES             Correction of 2nd (Faulty) ITF
      LWR,LORES             Correction of 2nd (Slightly Inaccurate) ITF

2 BDIST=number[,number]
This is a pair of numbers delineating the  background  spectrum  channel
positions  during  spectrum  extraction.   The distances are measured in
geometric pixels from the spectrum centre.

Negative distances mean "to the left of centre",  and positive distances
mean "to the right of centre".

If only one value is defined,  then this is taken  as  meaning  that the
channels are positioned symmetrically about centre.

The spectrum  "centre" is determined by  the  dispersion relations,  and
modified by any prevailing centroid shifts.
2 BKGAV=number
This is the  FWHM of a triangle function  filter  used  in  folding  the
pixel  intensities  to  form  the  smooth  background  spectrum.   It is
measured in geometric pixels.
2 BKGIT=number
This is the number of background smoothing iterations  performed  during
spectrum extraction.

BKGIT=0 means that the background is taken as  the  result of  the first
pass of a triangle function filter with FWHM defined by the BKGAV
parameter.

BKGIT=1 means that,  after producing the initial estimate for the smooth
background, pixels discrepant by more that BKGSD standard deviations are
marked  as  "spikes".   The  smooth  background  is  then  re-evaluated,
missing out the marked pixels.

Higher values of BKGIT are possible, but seldom necessary.
2 BKGSD=number
This is the  discrimination  level,  measured  in  standard  deviations,
beyond  which  background pixels are marked as "spikes".  It is not used
for BKGIT=0.
2 BSLIT=number[,number]
This defines the half width of  each  background  channel,  measured  in
geometric pixels.  A single value means that both channels have the same
width.
2 CAMERA=name
This is the Camera Name.  The following are defined:

      LWP          IUE Long Wavelength Prime.
      LWR          IUE Long Wavelength Redundant.
      SWP          IUE Short Wavelength Prime.
2 CENAV=number
This is the  FWHM of a triangle function  filter  used  in  folding  the
pixel intensities to form the smooth centroid positions.  It is measured
in geometric pixels.
2 CENIT=number
This is the number of  centroid  tracking  iterations  performed  during
spectrum extraction.

CENIT=0 means that the spectrum position is taken directly from the
dispersion relations.

CENIT=1 means that the spectrum position is  first  take  from  the
dispersion  relations,  but  is  modified  to  forced  it  to follow
the spectrum centroid.

Higher values of CENIT are  possible,  but  seldom  necessary: it either
works, or fails.
2 CENSD=number
This is  the discrimination  level,  measured  in  standard  deviations,
below  which  object  signal  is not considered significant enough to be
used to determine the centroid position.  It is not used for CENIT=0.
2 CENSH=boolean
This indicates whether the spectrum  signal  produces  a  single  linear
shift to the initial template.

This can be used in cases  whether the object signal is too weak to pro-
vide  a  detailed centroid determination, but it can at least be used to
move a pre-existing template shape into the right position.
2 CENSV=boolean
This indicates whether the spectrum template, as refined by  the  object
centroid  during  spectrum  extraction,  is  saved  in  the  calibration
dataset.

The primary use of this facility is in determining templates  from (say)
the  whole spectrum using TRAK,  and subsequently using these with 
LBLS,
or another spectrum.
2 CENTM=boolean
This indicates whether a centroid template from the calibration  dataset
is  used  as  a  start  in defining the precise position of the spectrum
signal on the image.

There is no guarantee that such a template will be available in a parti-
cular situation (camera/aperture/resolution/order).
2 COL=number
This specifies the line colour to be used  for  the  next  curve  to  be
plotted.  It can be an integer in the range 1 to 10.

Lines will only appear with different colours on displays which support
this!, on other devices COL is ignored.
2 COLOUR=boolean

 If COLOUR=TRUE then a false colour look-up table is used to derive
 pixel colours.  Otherwise a greyscale is used.

2 COLROT=boolean
This indicates whether the line colour is to be changed after  the  next
plot.   The  initial  line  has  colour  index 1 SOLID, unless specified
explicitly using the COL parameter.  The sequence of colour indices goes
(1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 1, 2, ...).

In commands where more than one line is plotted, COLROT  determines
whether these lines have different colours.

Lines will only appear with different colours on  displays which support
this!, on other devices COLROT is harmless.
2 CONTINUUM=boolean
This indicates whether the object spectrum  is  expected  to  contain  a
significant  continuum.   It  is  used  in conjunction with the EXTENDED
parameter  in  determining  the  positions  and  widths  of  object  and
background channels for spectrum extraction from HIRES datasets.
2 COVERGAP=boolean
If after mapping an order/aperture, a grid point is marked as  unusable,
then  this  parameter  determines  whether other orders/apertures can be
allowed to contribute to this grid point.
2 CUTFILE=string
This is the name of a file containing Echelle order wavelength limits.
A file type of ".cut" is assumed, and should not be specified
explicitly.

An environment variable may be used or pre-pended to the filename,
for example to load the supplied cut file for the SWP camera LAP:

   > NEWCUT CUTFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swplap
2 CUTWV=boolean
This indicates whether any available  Echelle  order  wavelength  cutoff
limits  are  to  be  used  for  the  spectrum extraction wavelength grid
limits.  Highly recommended, provided that  you  are  happy  with  these
wavelength limits.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 DAY=number
This is the Day number, measured from the start of the Month,  used  for
constructing dates. (1st of month=1, 31st of month=31.)
2 DEVICE=name
This  is  the  GKS/SGS  graphics  device.   A  list  of   possible  GKS
workstations may  be  found in SUN/83.  A list of SGS workstation names
available at your site may be obtained either by a null response to the
DEVICE parameter prompt (i.e.  "!"), or by using the IUEDR command SGS.
2 DISPFILE=string
This is the name of a file containing dispersion data.  A type of
".dsp" is assumed, and should not be specified explicitly.

An environment variable may be used or pre-pended to the filename,
for example to load the supplied dispersion file for the SWP camera
HIRES mode:

   > NEWDISP DISPFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swphi
2 DRIVE=name
This the device name of the Tape Drive.  Feasible values are
/dev/nrmt0h on a unix machine or MSA0 on a VMS machine.
Other values may apply, check with your system manager.
2 ESHIFT=number
This is a global wavelength shift applied to the wavelengths in  Echelle
spectral  orders.   It  is  measured  in  (A),  and affects the spectrum
wavelengths:

      WAV(NEW) = WAV(OLD) + ESHIFT / ORDER

This is designed to account for wavelength errors  that  result  from  a
global linear shift of the spectrum format on the image.
2 EXPOSURE=number
This is an exposure time associated with the spectrum.  If there is more
than  one  aperture,  then  this  time  applies to that specified by the
APERTURE parameter.
2 EXPOSURES=number[,number]
This is one or more exposure times  (in  seconds)  associated  with  the
spectrum.  There is an exposure time for each Aperture defined.
2 EXTENDED=boolean
This indicates whether the object spectrum is expected  to  be  extended
(rather  than  a  point  source).   It  is  used in conjunction with the
CONTINUUM parameter in determining  the  positions  and  widths  of  the
object  and  background channels used for spectrum extraction from HIRES
datasets.
2 FIDFILE=string
This is the name of a file containing  fiducial  positions.   A
type of ".fid" is assumed, and should not be specified explicitly.

An environment variable may be used or pre-pended to the filename,
for example to load the supplied fiducial file for a SWP camera
PHOT image:

   > NEWFID FIDFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swpr
2 FIDSIZE=number
This is the half width of a fiducial (considered square),  and  measured
in pixel units.
2 FILE=number
This is the Tape File Number.  The first file on a tape would be FILE=1.
One case  which may present  some problems is  that of  a tape with a an
End-of-volume (EOV) mark in the middle, and valuable  data  beyond.   An
EOV  is  two  consecutive Tape Marks (sometimes called "File Marks").  A
File is defined, here, as the information between two Tape Marks.  So if
the number for a (real) file before EOV is FILEN, then the number of the
next (real) file following the EOV is (FILEN+2).
2 FILLGAP=boolean
If a grid point in the mean spectrum would have had a contribution  from
a  bad  data point, this parameter determines whether that grid point is
marked as  unusable within  the context  of the order  or aperture being
mapped.  If the grid point is marked  as unusable in this way then other
(good) points cannot contribute to it.
2 FLAG=boolean
This specifies whether the data quality information is  displayed  along
with  the image.  If so, then faulty pixels will be marked with a colour
according to the following scheme:

      GREEN       pixels affected by reseau marks
      RED         pixels which are saturated (DN=255)
      ORANGE      pixels affected by ITF truncation
      YELLOW      pixels marked bad by the user

User edits are only shown where no other fault is present.

This option  would normally only  be used when assessing the  quality of
faulty pixels, possible  with a view to  using them (marking them "good"
with a cursor editor).
2 FN=number
This parameter is the  replacement  Flux  Number  for  a  pixel  changed
explicitly by the user.

2 FSCALE=number
This is an (arbitrary) scale factor  applied  to  spectrum  fluxes.   It
affects fluxes:

      FLUX(NEW) = FLUX(OLD) * FSCALE

It finds application in  accounting for grey attenuation, or obscuration
of object signal through a narrow aperture.
2 GSAMP=number
This is the sampling rate used for spectrum extraction.  It is  measured
in  "geometric pixels".  GSAMP=1.414 corresponds to the original IUESIPS
(1) sampling rate,  while GSAMP=0.707 corresponds  to  the later IUESIPS
(2) sampling rate.  Other values can be chosen.
2 GSHIFT=number,number
This is a global constant shift of the spectrum  format  on  the  image,
(DX, DY), where the geometric coordinates, (X, Y) of a spectrum position
are:

      X(NEW) = X(OLD) + DX
      Y(NEW) = Y(OLD) + DY
2 GSLIT=number[,number]
This is a pair of numbers delineating the object spectrum channel during
spectrum extraction.  The distances are measured in geometric pixels.

Negative distances mean "to the left of centre", and  positive distances
mean "to the right of centre".

Object channels that do NOT cover the actual object signal  on the image
will not be meaningful when centroid tracking is employed.

If only one value is defined, then this is taken as representing  a
channel that is symmetrical about the spectrum centre.

The spectrum "centre" is determined by  the  dispersion  relations, and
modified by any prevailing centroid shifts.
2 HALAV=number
This is the FWHM of a triangle  function  used  for  smoothing  the  net
spectrum for the HALTYPE=POWER halation correction technique.
2 HALC=number
This is the Halation correction constant used for  HALTYPE=POWER  cases,
and  defined  at wavelength HALWC.  The value of the correction constant
corresponds,  roughly  to  the  measured  depression  of  a  broad  zero
intensity absorption below "zero", in units of the continuum in adjacent
orders.  The "constant" varies with wavelength:

      C(WAV) = HALC * (WAV - HALW0) / (HALWC - HALW0)

See the HALAV, HALTYPE, HALW0 and HALWC parameters.
2 HALTYPE=name
This is the type of Halation (order-overlap) correction applied  to  the
flux spectrum.  It can take values:

      POWER         Correction based on power-law PSF decay.

See the HALAV, HALC and HALW0 parameters.
2 HALW0=number
This is the wavelength, measured in Angstroms,  at  which  the  halation
correction is zero.

See the HALC, HALTYPE and HALWC parameters.
2 HALWC=number
This is the wavelength, measured in Angstroms,  at  which  the  halation
correction is HALC.

See the HALC, HALTYPE and HALW0 parameters.
2 HIST=boolean
This determines whether lines are  plotted  as  histograms  rather  than
continuous lines (poly-lines).
2 IMAGE=number
This is the Image Sequence Number.
2 ITF=number
This is the ITF generation used in the photometric  calibration  of  the
image.   This  information  is  needed  for  the  correct  absolute flux
calibration of the resulting spectra.  Possible values for  each  camera
are as follows:

      SWP     1 (faulty), 2 and 3
      LWR     1 and 2
      LWP     1 and 2

Here are the ITF values associated with various forms of this table:

      ITF       TABLE                           IDENTIFICATION
      ITF 0     0  1800  3700  5600  ... 30000  Preliminary LWR ITF
      ITF 1     0  2303  4069  8008  ... 42032  2nd LWR ITF
      ITF 1     0  2300  3969  6062  ... 32973  1st LWP ITF
      ITF 2     0  2723  5429  8145  ... 38389  2nd LWP ITF
      ITF 0     0  1800  3600  5500  ...        Preliminary SWP ITF
      ITF 1     0  1753  3461  6936  ... 28674  Faulty, 2nd SWP ITF
      ITF 2     0  1684  3374  6873  ... 28500  Corrected, 3rd SWP ITF
2 ITFMAX=number
This is the pixel value on tape corresponding to  ITF  saturation.   Its
value  is  fixed  for  a  given  ITF table.  The value of ITFMAX is only
needed for IUE images of type "GPHOT".  The  appropriate  value  can  be
determined  from  inspection  of the IUE Text Header for the GPHOT file,
and in particular the table of numbers following the line  which  begins
"PCF C/**".  Here are the ITFMAX values associated with various forms of
this table:

      ITFMAX    TABLE                           IDENTIFICATION
      20000     0  1800  3700  5600  ... 30000  Preliminary LWR ITF
      27220     0  2303  4069  8008  ... 42032  2nd LWR ITF
      19983     0  1800  3600  5500  ...        Preliminary SWP ITF
      19740     0  1753  3461  6936  ... 28674  Faulty, 2nd SWP ITF
      19632     0  1684  3374  6873  ... 28500  Corrected, 3rd SWP ITF
2 LINE=name
This specifies the line style to be  used  for  the  next  curve  to  be
plotted.  It can be one of the following:

      SOLID        Solid (continuous) line
      DASH         Dashed line
      DOTDASH      Dot-dash line
      DOT          Dotted line

The order of these is that invoked when automatic line style rotation is
in effect (see the LINEROT parameter).
2 LINEROT=boolean
This indicates whether the line style is to be changed  after  the  next
plot.   The  initial  line  style  is SOLID, unless specified explicitly
using the LINE parameter.  The sequence  of  line  styles  goes  (SOLID,
DASH, DOTDASH, DOT, SOLID, DASH, ...).

In commands where more than one line is plotted, LINEROT determines
whether these lines have different styles.
2 ML=number,number
This is a pair of wavelength values defining the start and  end  of  the
mean spectrum grid.  The grid will  consist of Vacuum Wavelengths evenly
spaced between these values.
2 MONTH=number
This is the Month number, measured from the start of the Year,  used  in
constructing dates. (January=1, December=12.)
2 MSAMP=number
This is the (Vacuum) wavelength sampling  rate  for  the  mean  spectrum
grid.   If  it  does  not  fit an integral number of times into the grid
limits, then the latter are adjusted to fit.
2 NFILE=number
This is the number of tape files to be processed.  A value of "-1" means
all files until the end.
2 NGEOM=number
This is the number of Chebyshev terms used to represent the  geometrical
distortion.  The same value is used for each axis direction.
2 NLINE=number
This is the number of IUE header  lines  printed.   NLINE=-1  means  the
entire header is printed.
2 NORDER=number
This is the number of Echelle orders to be processed by a command.
2 NSKIP=number
This is the number of tape marks to be skipped.
2 OBJECT=string
This is a string  containing  text  to  identify  the  "object"  of  the
observation.   It  can, but need not, also contain information about the
observation (Camera, Image etc.).
2 ORDER=number
This is the Echelle order number.
2 ORDERS=number[,number]
This is a pair of Echelle order numbers delineating a range.  If only  a
single value is specified, then the range consists that order only.  The
"order" of the number pair is not significant.
2 OUTFILE=string
This is the name of a file to receive the output spectrum.
2 QUAL=boolean
This specifies whether the data quality  information  is  plotted  along
with the data.  If so, then faulty points will be marked with their data
quality severity code, which is one from:

     1    affected by extrapolated ITF
     2    affected by microphonics
     3    affected by spike
     4    affected by bright point (or user)
     5    affected by reseau mark
     6    affected by ITF truncation
     7    affected by saturation
     U    affected by user edit

User edits are only shown where no other fault is present.

This option  would normally  only be used  when assessing the quality of
faulty points,  possible with a view to using  them (marking them "good"
with a cursor editor).
2 RESOLUTION=name
This is the Spectrograph  Resolution  mode.   The  following  modes  are
defined:

      LORES        IUE Low Resolution.
      HIRES        IUE High Resolution (Echelle).
2 RIPA=number
This is an empirical scale factor that can be used to modify the Echelle
ripple  function.   The normal value is 1.  The primary component of the
ripple function is:

      SCALE = (SIN(X) / X)**2

where

      X = PI * RIPA * (WAV - WAVC) * ORDER / WAVC

and PI=3.14159, WAVC=RIPK/ORDER.  The net spectrum is divided  by  SCALE
above.   Empirical  values  of  RIPA  can be used to optimise the ripple
correction.

See the RIPC and RIPK parameter descriptions.
2 RIPC=number[,number]
This is a polynomial in "X" used to modify the  standard  Echelle  ripple
calibration function.  The calibration is given by:

      SCALE = (SIN(X)/X)**2 * (RIPC(1) + RIPC(2)*X + RIPC(3)*X**2 ...)

where

      X = PI * RIPA * (WAV - WAVC) * ORDER/WAVC

and PI=3.14159, WAVC=RIPK/ORDER.  The net spectrum is divided  by  SCALE
above.

See the RIPA and RIPK parameter descriptions.
2 RIPFILE=string
This is the name of a file containing an Echelle ripple calibration.
A  type of ".rip" is assumed, and should not be specified explicitly.

An environment variable may be used or pre-pended to the filename,
for example to load the supplied ripple file for the SWP camera:

   > NEWRIP RIPFILE=$IUEDR_DATA/swp
2 RIPK=number
This is the Echelle ripple constant measured in (A).  It corresponds  to
the   central  wavelength  of  Echelle  order  number  1.   The  central
wavelength of an arbitrary ORDER is:

      WAVC = RIPK / ORDER

Where this parameter is used for an entire HIRES dataset, the  parameter
can have more than 1 value, and represent a polynomial in ORDER:

      WAVC = (RIPK(1) + RIPK(2) * ORDER + RIPK(3) * ORDER**2...) / ORDER

See the RIPA and RIPC parameter descriptions.
2 RL=number,number
This is a pair of radial coordinate values defining the start and end of
the radial grid in an LBLS array.  These radial coordinates are measured
in geometric pixels, and run perpendicular to the dispersion  direction.
A coordinate of 0.0 corresponds to the centre of the spectrum.

Values of [0.0,0.0] indicate that internal defaults are to be adopted.
A single value is reflected symmetrically about 0.0.
2 RM=boolean
This determines whether the mean spectrum  is  reset  before  a  mapping
takes  place.   If  the  spectrum  is  not reset, then the spectra being
mapped will be averaged with the existing net spectrum.
2 RS=boolean
This determines whether the display screen is reset before plotting.
2 RSAMP=number
This is the sample spacing used for the radial grid in the  LBLS  array.
If it does not fit an integral number of times into the grid limits, RL,
then the latter are adjusted to fit.

Suggested values range from 0.707 to 1.414 pixels; the latter correspon-
ding to the IUESIPS LBLS grid.
2 SCANAV=number
This is the FWHM of a triangle function with  which  pixels  are  folded
during  the  generation  of  a  scan  across  the image perpendicular to
spectrograph dispersion.  It is measured in geometric pixels.
2 SCANDIST=number
This is the distance of a scan across a HIRES image from  the  faceplate
centre.  It is measured in geometric pixels.
2 SCANWV=number
This is the central wavelength for a scan of a LORES image perpendicular
to spectrograph dispersion.  It is measured in Angstroms (in vacuo).
2 SKIPNEXT=boolean
This determines whether the tape is positioned at the start of the  next
file  after processing.  If only the start of a file is being processed,
then by setting SKIPNEXT=FALSE, time can be saved.
2 SPECTYPE=number
This is the type of file (in the terminology of Steve Adams old SPECTRUM
program), to be created.  The following values are allowed:

      0       Starlink standard NDF
      1       Fixed format file
      2       Free format file

It is recommended  that  datasets  with  many  points  be  written  with
SPECTYPE=0,  which  is  more  efficient  in  disk  space  and time spent
reading/writing.

It should be noted  that files created  with any of these formats can be
read into the DIPSO program (Maslen/Howarth, UCL, see SUN/50).
2 TEMFILE=string
This is the name of a file which contains the standard spectrum template
data.  A type of ".tem" is assumed, which should not be specified expli-
citly.

An environment variable may be used or pre-pended to the filename,
for example to load the a template file "swptemp" from the a directory
named IUEDR_TEM:

   > NEWTEM TEMFILE=$IUEDR_TEM/swptemp
2 THDA=number
This is the IUE Camera Temperature, measured in degrees C.  It  is  used
for  such  things  as adjustments to Fiducial positions and Spectrograph
Dispersion  Relations.   A  value  of  0.0  implies  that  no  value  is
available.   A suitable value can be found in the IUE Header Text of the
final spectrum file on the Guest Observer Tape (IUESIPS 2 only).
2 THRESH=value
This is the  minimum value considered to be good.  All pixels with values
below this threshold will be marked BAD.
2 TYPE=name
This is the type for a dataset.  It need  only  be  specified  when  the
creating  command  cannot  determine  its  value  unambiguously from the
context.  Defined values are:

      RAW           IUE Raw Image.
      GPHOT         IUE GPHOT Image (Geometric/Photometric).
      PHOT          IUE PHOT Image (Photometric only).

Types PHOT and GPHOT are  not  automatically  distinguishable  from  IUE
Guest Observer  Tape contents.  As a  general guide,  datasets from 1982
onwards are of type PHOT.
2 V=string
This is a string  defining  a  list  of  items,  including  any  of  the
following characters:

      H      Header and File Information
      I      Image details
      F      Fiducials
      G      Geometry
      D      Dispersion
      C      Centroid Templates
      R      Echelle Ripple and Halation
      A      Absolute Calibration
      S      Raw Spectrum
      M      Mean Spectrum
      *      All of the above
      Q      Image Data Quality Summary

2 VSHIFT=number
This is the radial velocity of the detector relative to the Sun.  It  is
measured in (km/s) and affects the calibrated wavelength scale:

      WAV(TRUE) = WAV(OBSERVED) / (1 + VSHIFT / VLIGHT)

where VLIGHT is the light velocity in (km/s).
2 WCUT=number,number
This is one of the mechanisms that can be used to delimit the  parts  of
Echelle  orders that are calibrated for ripple response.  The two values
of this parameter are the start  and  end  wavelengths  for  a  specific
ORDER.

Apart from poor ripple calibration,  the order ends can also be affected
by  the parts of the camera faceplate that are retained in the image.
2 WSHIFT=number
This is a constant wavelength shift applied to spectrum wavelengths.  It
is measured in (A), and affects the spectrum wavelengths:

      WAV(NEW) = WAV(OLD) + WSHIFT

This is only used for LORES spectra.
2 XCUT=number,number
This is one of the mechanisms that can be used to delimit  the  ends  of
Echelle  orders that are calibrated for ripple response.  The two values
of this parameter are the start and end "X" coordinates  of  the  order,
where:

      X = PI * RIPA * (WAV - WAVC) * ORDER / WAVC

and PI=3.14159, WAVC=RIPK/ORDER.  The  nature  of  the  standard  ripple
function is that X is only formally meaningful in the range (-PI, +PI).

See the RIPK, RIPC and RIPA parameter descriptions.
2 XL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  x-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes
are being redrawn.  If both values are the same (e.g.  [0,0]), then  the
data  limits  in  the x-direction will be determined from the data being
plotted.
2 XP=number,number
This specifies the pixel limits along the  x-direction  used  for  image
display.  Values in decreasing order will cause the image to be inverted
along the x-direction.  If the values are undefined,  the  pixel  limits
will  default  to  include  the  whole  extent  of  the  image along the
x-direction.
2 YEAR=number
This is the Year (A.D.) used in constructing dates.
2 YL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  y-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes
are being redrawn.  If both values are the same (e.g.  [0,0]), then  the
data  limits  in  the y-direction will be determined from the data being
plotted.
2 YP=number,number
This specifies the pixel limits along the  y-direction  used  for  image
display.  Values in decreasing order will cause the image to be inverted
along the y-direction.  If the values are undefined,  the  pixel  limits
will  default  to  include  the  whole  extent  of  the  image along the
y-direction.
2 ZL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used  for  display  of  images.   If  the
values  are  given  in  decreasing  order, then high data values will be
represented by low (dark) display intensities, and vice-versa.   If  the
values are undefined, then the full intensity range of the image will be
used.

Data values which  fall below the lowest  display intensity are drawn in
BLACK,  while  those  which fall above the highest display intensity are
drawn BLUE.
2 ZONE=number
This specifies the zone to be used for plotting.  The zone numbers range
from  0  to  8  and  correspond to those defined by the TZONE command in
DIPSO (see SUN/50):

     0 entire display surface
     1 top left quarter
     2 top right quarter
     3 bottom left quarter
     4 bottom right quarter
     5 top half
     6 bottom half
     7 left half
     8 right half

   LINEROT         Whether line style is changed after next plot.
   COL             Plotting line colour (1, 2, 3, ..., 10).
   COLROT          Whether line colour is changed after next plot.
   XL              X-axis plotting limits.  [0,0] means auto-scale.
   YL              Y-axis plotting limits.  [0,0] means auto-scale.

2 Full
This command plots the smoothed centroid shifts produced during the most
recent  spectrum  extraction  from  the dataset specified by the DATASET
parameter, on the graphics device and zone specified by the  DEVICE  and
ZONE parameters respectively.

In the case of a LORES spectrum, if there is more than a single aperture
available, then the APERTURE parameter needs to be specified.

In the case of a HIRES spectrum,  if there is more than a single echelle
order, then the ORDER parameter needs to be specified.

The RS parameter specifies whether a new plot is started, or whether the
data can be plotted over an existing plot.

The LINE and LINEROT parameters  determine the  line style which will be
used for plotting.

The COL and COLROT parameters  determine the  line colour which  will be
used for plotting if the DEVICE supports colour graphics.

The diagram limits are specified by the XL and YL parameter values.
If XL and YL have values:

        XL=[0,0], YL=[0,0]

Then the plot limits along each axis are determined so  that  the  whole
spectrum  is  visible.   If  the  values  of  XL  or YL are specified in
decreasing order, then  the  coordinates  will  be  reversed  along  the
appropriate axis.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 ORDER=number
This is the Echelle order number.
2 APERTURE=name
This is the name of an individual aperture.  The following names have
defined meanings:

      SAP       IUE Small Aperture
      LAP       IUE Large Aperture

Other apertures names may also be defined.
2 DEVICE=name
This  is  the  GKS/SGS  graphics  device.   A  list  of   possible  GKS
workstations may  be  found in SUN/83.  A list of SGS workstation names
available at your site may be obtained either by a null response to the
DEVICE parameter prompt (i.e.  "!"), or by using the IUEDR command SGS.
2 ZONE=number
This specifies the zone to be used for plotting.  The zone numbers range
from  0  to  8  and  correspond to those defined by the TZONE command in
DIPSO (see SUN/50):

     0 entire display surface
     1 top left quarter
     2 top right quarter
     3 bottom left quarter
     4 bottom right quarter
     5 top half
     6 bottom half
     7 left half
     8 right half
2 RS=boolean
This determines whether the display screen is reset before plotting.
2 LINE=name
This specifies the line style to be  used  for  the  next  curve  to  be
plotted.  It can be one of the following:

      SOLID        Solid (continuous) line
      DASH         Dashed line
      DOTDASH      Dot-dash line
      DOT          Dotted line

The order of these is that invoked when automatic line style rotation is
in effect (see the LINEROT parameter).
2 LINEROT=boolean
This indicates whether the line style is to be changed  after  the  next
plot.   The  initial  line  style  is SOLID, unless specified explicitly
using the LINE parameter.  The sequence  of  line  styles  goes  (SOLID,
DASH, DOTDASH, DOT, SOLID, DASH, ...).

In commands where more than one line is plotted, LINEROT determines
whether these lines have different styles.
2 COL=number
This specifies the line colour to be used  for  the  next  curve  to  be
plotted.  It can be an integer in the range 1 to 10.

Lines will only appear with different colours on displays which support
this!, on other devices COL is ignored.
2 COLROT=boolean
This indicates whether the line colour is to be changed after  the  next
plot.   The  initial  line  has  colour  index 1 SOLID, unless specified
explicitly using the COL parameter.  The sequence of colour indices goes
(1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 1, 2, ...).

In commands where more than one line is plotted, COLROT  determines
whether these lines have different colours.

Lines will only appear with different colours on  displays which support
this!, on other devices COLROT is harmless.
2 XL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  x-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes
are being redrawn.  If both values are the same (e.g.  [0,0]), then  the
data  limits  in  the x-direction will be determined from the data being
plotted.
2 YL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  y-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes
are being redrawn.  If both values are the same (e.g.  [0,0]), then  the
data  limits  in  the y-direction will be determined from the data being
plotted.

This command plots the calibrated flux spectrum specified by the DATASET
parameter  on  the  graphics device and zone specified by the DEVICE and 
ZONE parameters respectively.

The HIST parameter determines  whether the line is drawn  as a histogram
rather than a continuous polyline.

In the case of a LORES spectrum, if there is more than a single aperture
available, then the APERTURE parameter needs to be specified.

In the case of a HIRES spectrum,  if there is more than a single echelle
order, then the ORDER parameter needs to be specified.

The RS parameter specifies whether a new plot is started, or whether the
data can be plotted over an existing plot.

The LINE and LINEROT parameters  determine the  line style which will be
used for plotting.

The COL and COLROT parameters  determine the  line colour which  will be
used for plotting if the DEVICE supports colour graphics.

The diagram limits are specified by the XL and YL parameter values.
If XL and YL have values:

        XL=[0,0], YL=[0,0]

Then the plot limits along each axis are determined so  that  the  whole
spectrum  is  visible.   If  the  values  of  XL  or YL are specified in
decreasing order, then  the  coordinates  will  be  reversed  along  the
appropriate axis.

The QUAL parameter indicates whether faulty points are flagged with
their data quality codes:

     1    affected by extrapolated ITF
     2    affected by microphonics
     3    affected by spike
     4    affected by bright point (or user)
     5    affected by reseau mark
     6    affected by ITF truncation
     7    affected by saturation
     U    affected by user edit

If a point is affected by more than one of the above  faults,  then  the
highest  code  is  plotted.   Points  marked  bad by user edits are only
indicted if they are otherwise fault-free.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 ORDER=number
This is the Echelle order number.
2 APERTURE=name
This is the name of an individual aperture.  The following names have
defined meanings:

      SAP       IUE Small Aperture
      LAP       IUE Large Aperture

Other apertures names may also be defined.
2 DEVICE=name
This  is  the  GKS/SGS  graphics  device.   A  list  of   possible  GKS
workstations may  be  found in SUN/83.  A list of SGS workstation names
available at your site may be obtained either by a null response to the
DEVICE parameter prompt (i.e.  "!"), or by using the IUEDR command SGS.
2 ZONE=number
This specifies the zone to be used for plotting.  The zone numbers range
from  0  to  8  and  correspond to those defined by the TZONE command in

      DASH         Dashed line
      DOTDASH      Dot-dash line

The order of these is that invoked when automatic line style rotation is
in effect (see the LINEROT parameter).
2 LINEROT=boolean
This indicates whether the line style is to be changed  after  the  next
plot.   The  initial  line  style  is SOLID, unless specified explicitly
using the LINE parameter.  The sequence  of  line  styles  goes  (SOLID,

plot.   The  initial  line  has  colour  index 1 SOLID, unless specified
explicitly using the COL parameter.  The sequence of colour indices goes
(1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 1, 2, ...).

In commands where more than one line is plotted, COLROT  determines
whether these lines have different colours.

Lines will only appear with different colours on  displays which support
this!, on other devices COLROT is harmless.
2 HIST=boolean
This determines whether lines are  plotted  as  histograms  rather  than
continuous lines (poly-lines).
2 QUAL=boolean
This specifies whether the data quality  information  is  plotted  along
with the data.  If so, then faulty points will be marked with their data
quality severity code, which is one from:

     2    affected by microphonics
     3    affected by spike
     4    affected by bright point (or user)
     5    affected by reseau mark
     6    affected by ITF truncation
     7    affected by saturation
     U    affected by user edit

faulty points,  possible with a view to using  them (marking them "good"
with a cursor editor).
2 XL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  x-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes

This command plots  the  pseudo-gross  and  smooth  background  produced
during the most recent spectrum extraction from the dataset specified by
the DATASET parameter, on the graphics device and zone specified by  the
DEVICE and ZONE parameters respectively.

The pseudo-gross is  constructed by  taking the net  spectrum and adding
the smooth  background  multiplied  by the width of  the object channel.
The smooth background plotted is also for the object channel width.

The HIST parameter  determines whether the  line is drawn as a histogram
rather than a continuous polyline.

In the case of a LORES spectrum, if there is more than a single aperture
available, then the APERTURE parameter needs to be specified.

In the case of a HIRES spectrum,  if there is more than a single echelle
order, then the ORDER parameter needs to be specified.

The RS parameter specifies whether a new plot is started, or whether the
data can be plotted over an existing plot.

used for plotting.

The COL and COLROT parameters  determine the  line colour which  will be
used for plotting if the DEVICE supports colour graphics.

The diagram limits are specified by the XL and YL parameter values.
If XL and YL have values:

        XL=[0,0], YL=[0,0]

Then the plot limits along each axis are determined so  that  the  whole
spectrum  is  visible.   If  the  values  of  XL  or YL are specified in
decreasing order, then  the  coordinates  will  be  reversed  along  the
appropriate axis.

Lines will only appear with different colours on displays which support
this!, on other devices COL is ignored.
2 COLROT=boolean
This indicates whether the line colour is to be changed after  the  next
plot.   The  initial  line  has  colour  index 1 SOLID, unless specified
explicitly using the COL parameter.  The sequence of colour indices goes
(1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 1, 2, ...).

In commands where more than one line is plotted, COLROT  determines
whether these lines have different colours.

Lines will only appear with different colours on  displays which support
this!, on other devices COLROT is harmless.
2 HIST=boolean
This determines whether lines are  plotted  as  histograms  rather  than
continuous lines (poly-lines).
2 QUAL=boolean
This specifies whether the data quality  information  is  plotted  along
with the data.  If so, then faulty points will be marked with their data
quality severity code, which is one from:

     1    affected by extrapolated ITF
     2    affected by microphonics
     3    affected by spike
     4    affected by bright point (or user)
     5    affected by reseau mark
     6    affected by ITF truncation
     7    affected by saturation
     U    affected by user edit

User edits are only shown where no other fault is present.

This option  would normally  only be used  when assessing the quality of
faulty points,  possible with a view to using  them (marking them "good"
with a cursor editor).
2 XL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  x-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes
are being redrawn.  If both values are the same (e.g.  [0,0]), then  the
data  limits  in  the x-direction will be determined from the data being
plotted.
2 YL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  y-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes
are being redrawn.  If both values are the same (e.g.  [0,0]), then  the
data  limits  in  the y-direction will be determined from the data being
plotted.
1 PLSCAN
 Plot scan perpendicular to dispersion.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   DEVICE          GKS/SGS graphics device name.
   ZONE            Zone to be used for plotting.
   RS              Whether display is reset before plotting.
   LINE            Plotting line style (SOLID, DASH, DOTDASH or DOT).
   LINEROT         Whether line style is changed after next plot.
   COL             Plotting line colour (1, 2, 3, ..., 10).
   COLROT          Whether line colour is changed after next plot.
   HIST            Whether lines are drawn as histograms.
   QUAL            Whether data quality information is plotted.
   XL              X-axis plotting limits.  [0,0] means auto-scale.
   YL              Y-axis plotting limits.  [0,0] means auto-scale.
2 Full
Plot the most recent scan perpendicular to  dispersion  associated  with
the  dataset  specified by the DATASET parameter, on the graphics device
and zone specified by the DEVICE and ZONE parameters respectively.

The RS parameter specifies whether a new plot is started, or whether the
data can be plotted over an existing plot.

The LINE and LINEROT parameters  determine the  line style which will be
used for plotting.

The COL and COLROT parameters  determine the  line colour which  will be
used for plotting if the DEVICE supports colour graphics.

The diagram limits are specified by the XL and YL parameter values.
If XL and YL have values:

        XL=[0,0], YL=[0,0]

Then the plot limits along each axis are determined so  that  the  whole
spectrum  is  visible.   If  the  values  of  XL  or YL are specified in
decreasing order, then  the  coordinates  will  be  reversed  along  the
appropriate axis.

The QUAL parameter indicates whether faulty points are flagged with
their data quality codes:

     1    affected by extrapolated ITF
     2    affected by microphonics
     3    affected by spike
     4    affected by bright point (or user)
     5    affected by reseau mark
     6    affected by ITF truncation
     7    affected by saturation
     U    affected by user edit

If a point is affected by more than one of the above  faults,  then  the
highest  code  is  plotted.   Points  marked  bad by user edits are only
indicted if they are otherwise fault-free.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file

This  is  the  GKS/SGS  graphics  device.   A  list  of   possible  GKS
workstations may  be  found in SUN/83.  A list of SGS workstation names
available at your site may be obtained either by a null response to the
DEVICE parameter prompt (i.e.  "!"), or by using the IUEDR command SGS.
2 ZONE=number

from  0  to  8  and  correspond to those defined by the TZONE command in
DIPSO (see SUN/50):

     0 entire display surface
     1 top left quarter
     2 top right quarter
     3 bottom left quarter
     4 bottom right quarter

      DASH         Dashed line
      DOTDASH      Dot-dash line
      DOT          Dotted line

The order of these is that invoked when automatic line style rotation is
in effect (see the LINEROT parameter).
2 LINEROT=boolean
This indicates whether the line style is to be changed  after  the  next
plot.   The  initial  line  style  is SOLID, unless specified explicitly
using the LINE parameter.  The sequence  of  line  styles  goes  (SOLID,
DASH, DOTDASH, DOT, SOLID, DASH, ...).

In commands where more than one line is plotted, LINEROT determines
whether these lines have different styles.
2 COL=number
This specifies the line colour to be used  for  the  next  curve  to  be
plotted.  It can be an integer in the range 1 to 10.

Lines will only appear with different colours on displays which support
this!, on other devices COL is ignored.
2 COLROT=boolean
This indicates whether the line colour is to be changed after  the  next
plot.   The  initial  line  has  colour  index 1 SOLID, unless specified
explicitly using the COL parameter.  The sequence of colour indices goes
(1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 1, 2, ...).

In commands where more than one line is plotted, COLROT  determines
whether these lines have different colours.

Lines will only appear with different colours on  displays which support
this!, on other devices COLROT is harmless.
2 QUAL=boolean
This specifies whether the data quality  information  is  plotted  along
with the data.  If so, then faulty points will be marked with their data
quality severity code, which is one from:

     6    affected by ITF truncation
     7    affected by saturation
     U    affected by user edit

User edits are only shown where no other fault is present.

This option  would normally  only be used  when assessing the quality of
faulty points,  possible with a view to using  them (marking them "good"
with a cursor editor).
2 XL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  x-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes
are being redrawn.  If both values are the same (e.g.  [0,0]), then  the
data  limits  in  the x-direction will be determined from the data being
plotted.
2 YL=number,number
This specifies the data limits used for  plotting  in  the  y-direction.
This  parameter is only read if the display has been reset, and the axes
are being redrawn.  If both values are the same (e.g.  [0,0]), then  the

This is one or more exposure times  (in  seconds)  associated  with  the
spectrum.  There is an exposure time for each Aperture defined.
2 FILE=number
This is the Tape File Number.  The first file on a tape would be FILE=1.
One case  which may present  some problems is  that of  a tape with a an
End-of-volume (EOV) mark in the middle, and valuable  data  beyond.   An
EOV  is  two  consecutive Tape Marks (sometimes called "File Marks").  A
File is defined, here, as the information between two Tape Marks.  So if
the number for a (real) file before EOV is FILEN, then the number of the
next (real) file following the EOV is (FILEN+2).
2 IMAGE=number
This is the Image Sequence Number.
2 ITF=number

2 ITFMAX=number
This is the pixel value on tape corresponding to  ITF  saturation.   Its
value  is  fixed  for  a  given  ITF table.  The value of ITFMAX is only
needed for IUE images of type "GPHOT".  The  appropriate  value  can  be
determined  from  inspection  of the IUE Text Header for the GPHOT file,
and in particular the table of numbers following the line  which  begins
"PCF C/**".  Here are the ITFMAX values associated with various forms of
this table:

2 THDA=number
This is the IUE Camera Temperature, measured in degrees C.  It  is  used
for  such  things  as adjustments to Fiducial positions and Spectrograph
Dispersion  Relations.   A  value  of  0.0  implies  that  no  value  is
available.   A suitable value can be found in the IUE Header Text of the
final spectrum file on the Guest Observer Tape (IUESIPS 2 only).
2 TYPE=name
This is the type for a dataset.  It need  only  be  specified  when  the

End-of-volume (EOV) mark in the middle, and valuable  data  beyond.   An
EOV  is  two  consecutive Tape Marks (sometimes called "File Marks").  A
File is defined, here, as the information between two Tape Marks.  So if

next (real) file following the EOV is (FILEN+2).
2 IMAGE=number
This is the Image Sequence Number.
2 ITF=number

2 MONTH=number
This is the Month number, measured from the start of the Year,  used  in
constructing dates. (January=1, December=12.)

entire header is printed.
2 OBJECT=string
This is a string  containing  text  to  identify  the  "object"  of  the
observation.   It  can, but need not, also contain information about the
observation (Camera, Image etc.).

This is the IUE Camera Temperature, measured in degrees C.  It  is  used
for  such  things  as adjustments to Fiducial positions and Spectrograph
Dispersion  Relations.   A  value  of  0.0  implies  that  no  value  is
available.   A suitable value can be found in the IUE Header Text of the
final spectrum file on the Guest Observer Tape (IUESIPS 2 only).
2 YEAR=number
This is the Year (A.D.) used in constructing dates.
1 SAVE
 Write new versions for any files that have had their  contents  changed
 in the current session.

2 Full
This command forces new versions to be written for  dataset  files  that
have  had  their  contents changed during the current session.  If there
are no outstanding files then this command does nothing.

Note that the existing files for the current dataset are overwritten.
1 SCAN
 This command performs a scan perpendicular to spectrograph dispersion.

   DATASET         Dataset name.
   ORDERS          This delineates a range of Echelle orders.
   APERTURE        Aperture name (SAP or LAP).
   SCANDIST        Distance  of  HIRES  scan   from   faceplate   centre
                   (geometric pixels).
   SCANAV          Averaging  filter  FWHM  for  image  scan  (geometric
                   pixels).

2 Full
This command performs a scan perpendicular to  spectrograph  dispersion.
The  scan  is  performed by folding pixels with a triangle function with
FWHM of SCANAV geometric pixels (ALONG the dispersion direction).

In the case of HIRES,  the SCANDIST parameter determines the distance of
the scan from the faceplate centre.

In the case of LORES,  the SCANWV parameter determines the central wave-
length of the scan.

The algorithm used to  produce scan  intensities is not very good and so
quantitative results  should  not be sought from this command.  Its sole
intention lies in providing data for aligning the spectrum.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 APERTURE=name
This is the name of an individual aperture.  The following names have
defined meanings:

      SAP       IUE Small Aperture
      LAP       IUE Large Aperture

Other apertures names may also be defined.
2 ORDERS=number[,number]
This is a pair of Echelle order numbers delineating a range.  If only  a
single value is specified, then the range consists that order only.  The
"order" of the number pair is not significant.
2 SCANDIST=number
This is the distance of a scan across a HIRES image from  the  faceplate
centre.  It is measured in geometric pixels.
2 SCANAV=number

   ESHIFT          Global Echelle wavelength shift.
   GSHIFT          Global shift of spectrum on image (geometric pixels).

2 Full
This command allows changes to be  made  to  dataset  values  which  are
specific  to the specified APERTURE.  Items for which parameters are not
specified retain their current values.
2 APERTURE=name
This is the name of an individual aperture.  The following names have
defined meanings:

Other apertures names may also be defined.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 ESHIFT=number
This is a global wavelength shift applied to the wavelengths in  Echelle
spectral  orders.   It  is  measured  in  (A),  and affects the spectrum
wavelengths:

      WAV(NEW) = WAV(OLD) + ESHIFT / ORDER

This is designed to account for wavelength errors  that  result  from  a
global linear shift of the spectrum format on the image.
2 EXPOSURE=number
This is an exposure time associated with the spectrum.  If there is more
than  one  aperture,  then  this  time  applies to that specified by the
APERTURE parameter.
2 FSCALE=number
This is an (arbitrary) scale factor  applied  to  spectrum  fluxes.   It
affects fluxes:

      FLUX(NEW) = FLUX(OLD) * FSCALE

It finds application in  accounting for grey attenuation, or obscuration
of object signal through a narrow aperture.
2 GSHIFT=number,number
This is a global constant shift of the spectrum  format  on  the  image,
(DX, DY), where the geometric coordinates, (X, Y) of a spectrum position
are:

      X(NEW) = X(OLD) + DX
      Y(NEW) = Y(OLD) + DY
2 VSHIFT=number
This is the radial velocity of the detector relative to the Sun.  It  is
measured in (km/s) and affects the calibrated wavelength scale:

      WAV(TRUE) = WAV(OBSERVED) / (1 + VSHIFT / VLIGHT)

where VLIGHT is the light velocity in (km/s).
2 WSHIFT=number
This is a constant wavelength shift applied to spectrum wavelengths.  It
is measured in (A), and affects the spectrum wavelengths:

   HALAV           Averaging  FWHM  for halation  correction  (geometric
                   pixels).

2 Full
This command allows changes to be  made  to  dataset  values  which  are
independent  of any specific APERTURE/ORDER.  Items for which parameters
are not specified retain their current values.
2 BADITF=boolean
This parameter determines whether a correction  is  made  to  the  pixel
intensities to account for errors during Ground Station ITF calibration.
(Note  that  the  best  scientific  results  would  be   obtained   from
reprocessed  data which can be obtained on request.) The following cases
are handled:

      SWP,LORES             Correction of 2nd (Faulty) ITF
      LWR,LORES             Correction of 2nd (Slightly Inaccurate) ITF

2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 FIDSIZE=number
This is the half width of a fiducial (considered square),  and  measured
in pixel units.
2 HALAV=number
This is the FWHM of a triangle  function  used  for  smoothing  the  net
spectrum for the HALTYPE=POWER halation correction technique.
2 HALC=number
This is the Halation correction constant used for  HALTYPE=POWER  cases,
and  defined  at wavelength HALWC.  The value of the correction constant
corresponds,  roughly  to  the  measured  depression  of  a  broad  zero
intensity absorption below "zero", in units of the continuum in adjacent
orders.  The "constant" varies with wavelength:

      C(WAV) = HALC * (WAV - HALW0) / (HALWC - HALW0)

See the HALAV, HALTYPE, HALW0 and HALWC parameters.
2 HALTYPE=name
This is the type of Halation (order-overlap) correction applied  to  the
flux spectrum.  It can take values:

      POWER         Correction based on power-law PSF decay.

See the HALAV, HALC and HALW0 parameters.
2 HALWC=number
This is the wavelength, measured in Angstroms,  at  which  the  halation
correction is HALC.

See the HALC, HALTYPE and HALW0 parameters.
2 HALW0=number
This is the wavelength, measured in Angstroms,  at  which  the  halation
correction is zero.

See the HALC, HALTYPE and HALWC parameters.
2 NGEOM=number
This is the number of Chebyshev terms used to represent the  geometrical
distortion.  The same value is used for each axis direction.
2 OBJECT=string
This is a string  containing  text  to  identify  the  "object"  of  the
observation.   It  can, but need not, also contain information about the
observation (Camera, Image etc.).
2 RIPA=number
This is an empirical scale factor that can be used to modify the Echelle
ripple  function.   The normal value is 1.  The primary component of the
ripple function is:

      SCALE = (SIN(X) / X)**2

where

      X = PI * RIPA * (WAV - WAVC) * ORDER / WAVC

and PI=3.14159, WAVC=RIPK/ORDER.  The net spectrum is divided  by  SCALE
above.   Empirical  values  of  RIPA  can be used to optimise the ripple
correction.

See the RIPC and RIPK parameter descriptions.
2 RIPK=number
This is the Echelle ripple constant measured in (A).  It corresponds  to
the   central  wavelength  of  Echelle  order  number  1.   The  central
wavelength of an arbitrary ORDER is:

      WAVC = RIPK / ORDER

Where this parameter is used for an entire HIRES dataset, the  parameter
can have more than 1 value, and represent a polynomial in ORDER:

      WAVC = (RIPK(1) + RIPK(2) * ORDER + RIPK(3) * ORDER**2...) / ORDER

See the RIPA and RIPC parameter descriptions.
2 THDA=number
This is the IUE Camera Temperature, measured in degrees C.  It  is  used
for  such  things  as adjustments to Fiducial positions and Spectrograph
Dispersion  Relations.   A  value  of  0.0  implies  that  no  value  is
available.   A suitable value can be found in the IUE Header Text of the
final spectrum file on the Guest Observer Tape (IUESIPS 2 only).
2 XCUT=number,number
This is one of the mechanisms that can be used to delimit  the  ends  of
Echelle  orders that are calibrated for ripple response.  The two values
of this parameter are the start and end "X" coordinates  of  the  order,
where:

      X = PI * RIPA * (WAV - WAVC) * ORDER / WAVC

and PI=3.14159, WAVC=RIPK/ORDER.  The  nature  of  the  standard  ripple
function is that X is only formally meaningful in the range (-PI, +PI).

See the RIPK, RIPC and RIPA parameter descriptions.

2 ORDER=number
This is the Echelle order number.
2 RIPK=number
This is the Echelle ripple constant measured in (A).  It corresponds  to
the   central  wavelength  of  Echelle  order  number  1.   The  central
wavelength of an arbitrary ORDER is:

      WAVC = RIPK / ORDER

Where this parameter is used for an entire HIRES dataset, the  parameter
can have more than 1 value, and represent a polynomial in ORDER:

      WAVC = (RIPK(1) + RIPK(2) * ORDER + RIPK(3) * ORDER**2...) / ORDER

See the RIPA and RIPC parameter descriptions.
2 RIPA=number
This is an empirical scale factor that can be used to modify the Echelle
ripple  function.   The normal value is 1.  The primary component of the
ripple function is:

      SCALE = (SIN(X) / X)**2

where

      X = PI * RIPA * (WAV - WAVC) * ORDER / WAVC

and PI=3.14159, WAVC=RIPK/ORDER.  The net spectrum is divided  by  SCALE
above.   Empirical  values  of  RIPA  can be used to optimise the ripple
correction.

See the RIPC and RIPK parameter descriptions.
2 RIPC=number[,number]
This is a polynomial in "X" used to modify the  standard  Echelle  ripple
calibration function.  The calibration is given by:

      SCALE = (SIN(X)/X)**2 * (RIPC(1) + RIPC(2)*X + RIPC(3)*X**2 ...)

where

      X = PI * RIPA * (WAV - WAVC) * ORDER/WAVC

and PI=3.14159, WAVC=RIPK/ORDER.  The net spectrum is divided  by  SCALE
above.

See the RIPA and RIPK parameter descriptions.
2 WCUT=number,number
This is one of the mechanisms that can be used to delimit the  parts  of
Echelle  orders that are calibrated for ripple response.  The two values
of this parameter are the start  and  end  wavelengths  for  a  specific
ORDER.

Apart from poor ripple calibration,  the order ends can also be affected
by  the parts of the camera faceplate that are retained in the image.

2 Full
This command extracts a  spectrum  from  an  image.   It  does  this  by
defining  an  evenly  spaced  wavelength  grid  along  the spectrum, and
mapping pixel intensities  onto  this  grid  in  object  and  background
channels.   The  background  pixels are used to form a smooth background
spectrum.  The object pixels (less smooth background) are used  to  form
the integrated net signal for the object.

In the LORES case  the spectrum specified  by the APERTURE  parameter is
extracted.

In the HIRES case,  the first echelle order to be extracted is specified
by  the ORDER.  Up to NORDER orders are extracted,  with ORDER each time
being decremented.

The wavelength  grid is defined  by region  of the dispersion  line con-
tained in  the image subset (faceplate).  The grid spacing is set by the
GSAMP parameter value which is the sample step in geometric  pixels. The
wavelength limits can optionally be constrained within the echelle
cutoff values by specifying CUTWV=YES.

The object  and background  channel widths and positions  are determined
automatically  if AUTOSLIT=YES.  Otherwise,  the object channel is spec-
ified  by  the values  of the  GSLIT parameter,  whilst  the  background
channel positions and widths are determined by the BDIST and BSLIT para-
meter values respectively.

The EXTENDED and CONTINUUM parameters allow  more  precise  control over
slit determinations (see User Guide, MUD/45).

The background spectrum is smoothed with a triangle function, FWHM given
by  the  BKGAV parameter (in  geometric  pixels).  Once  the  background
channel spectra have been obtained, they are extracted a  further  BKGIT
times.  Prior to each additional background extraction, pixels which are
outside BKGSD local standard deviations are rejected.

The object spectrum is obtained by integrating  pixel  intensities (less
smooth background)  within the object channel.  Once the object spectrum
has been obtained, it is extracted an additional  CENIT times, each time
the centroid positions from the previous extraction being used to follow
the spectrum.  The centroid spectrum (template) is  smoothed by  folding
with a triangle  function,  FWHM given  by the CENAV parameter (in  geo-
metric  pixels).  Wavelengths  with  flux  levels  below  CENSD standard
deviations  above  background are not  used in determining  the centroid
spectrum.

The initial  spectrum template  is by  default given  by  the dispersion
relations.  However, if CENTM=YES then a pre-defined template associated
with the dataset may be used as a start guess.  If  CENSH=YES then  this
template can  be shifted  linearly to  match the image (without changing
its shape).  If CENSV=YES then the  final centroid  spectrum  is used to
update the spectrum template in the dataset.

The net flux associated with  a wavelength point in  the final extracted
spectrum is  defined as the integral of  pixel intensities  over a rect-
angle with  dimensions given by  the object  channel width and the wave-
length interval.  These fluxes are  scaled so that they correspond to an
interval  along the  wavelength  direction  of 1.414  geometric  pixels.
This  is  so  that  the  standard  IUESIPS  calibrations  can be applied
regardless of what actual sample rate has been employed.   The  integral
is performed by using linear interpolation of pixel intensities.
2 APERTURE=name
This is the name of an individual aperture.  The following names have
defined meanings:

      SAP       IUE Small Aperture
      LAP       IUE Large Aperture

Other apertures names may also be defined.
2 AUTOSLIT=boolean
This determines whether the extraction slit is determined  automatically
by the command.  When AUTOSLIT=TRUE the BDIST, BSLIT and GSLIT parameter
values  are  determined  automatically,  based  on   the   IUE   Camera,
Resolution,  Aperture,  and  on the values of the CONTINUUM and EXTENDED
parameters.  This mode of operation  is  probably  the  best  for  point
source objects.
2 BDIST=number[,number]
This is a pair of numbers delineating the  background  spectrum  channel
positions  during  spectrum  extraction.   The distances are measured in
geometric pixels from the spectrum centre.

Negative distances mean "to the left of centre",  and positive distances
mean "to the right of centre".

If only one value is defined,  then this is taken  as  meaning  that the
channels are positioned symmetrically about centre.

The spectrum  "centre" is determined by  the  dispersion relations,  and
modified by any prevailing centroid shifts.
2 BKGAV=number
This is the  FWHM of a triangle function  filter  used  in  folding  the
pixel  intensities  to  form  the  smooth  background  spectrum.   It is
measured in geometric pixels.
2 BKGIT=number
This is the number of background smoothing iterations  performed  during
spectrum extraction.

BKGIT=0 means that the background is taken as  the  result of  the first
pass of a triangle function filter with FWHM defined by the BKGAV
parameter.

BKGIT=1 means that,  after producing the initial estimate for the smooth
background, pixels discrepant by more that BKGSD standard deviations are
marked  as  "spikes".   The  smooth  background  is  then  re-evaluated,
missing out the marked pixels.

Higher values of BKGIT are possible, but seldom necessary.
2 BKGSD=number
This is the  discrimination  level,  measured  in  standard  deviations,
beyond  which  background pixels are marked as "spikes".  It is not used
for BKGIT=0.
2 BSLIT=number[,number]
This defines the half width of  each  background  channel,  measured  in
geometric pixels.  A single value means that both channels have the same
width.
2 CENTM=boolean
This indicates whether a centroid template from the calibration  dataset
is  used  as  a  start  in defining the precise position of the spectrum
signal on the image.

There is no guarantee that such a template will be available in a parti-
cular situation (camera/aperture/resolution/order).
2 CENAV=number
This is the  FWHM of a triangle function  filter  used  in  folding  the
pixel intensities to form the smooth centroid positions.  It is measured
in geometric pixels.
2 CENIT=number
This is the number of  centroid  tracking  iterations  performed  during
spectrum extraction.

CENIT=0 means that the spectrum position is taken directly from the
dispersion relations.

CENIT=1 means that the spectrum position is  first  take  from  the
dispersion  relations,  but  is  modified  to  forced  it  to follow
the spectrum centroid.

Higher values of CENIT are  possible,  but  seldom  necessary: it either
works, or fails.
2 CENSD=number
This is  the discrimination  level,  measured  in  standard  deviations,
below  which  object  signal  is not considered significant enough to be
used to determine the centroid position.  It is not used for CENIT=0.
2 CENSH=boolean
This indicates whether the spectrum  signal  produces  a  single  linear
shift to the initial template.

This can be used in cases  whether the object signal is too weak to pro-
vide  a  detailed centroid determination, but it can at least be used to
move a pre-existing template shape into the right position.
2 CENSV=boolean
This indicates whether the spectrum template, as refined by  the  object
centroid  during  spectrum  extraction,  is  saved  in  the  calibration
dataset.

The primary use of this facility is in determining templates  from (say)
the  whole spectrum using TRAK,  and subsequently using these with 
LBLS,
or another spectrum.
2 CONTINUUM=boolean
This indicates whether the object spectrum  is  expected  to  contain  a
significant  continuum.   It  is  used  in conjunction with the EXTENDED
parameter  in  determining  the  positions  and  widths  of  object  and
background channels for spectrum extraction from HIRES datasets.
2 CUTWV=boolean
This indicates whether any available  Echelle  order  wavelength  cutoff
limits  are  to  be  used  for  the  spectrum extraction wavelength grid
limits.  Highly recommended, provided that  you  are  happy  with  these
wavelength limits.
2 DATASET=filename
This is the root name of the file containing the dataset.  The file type
(e.g. "_UED.sdf") should not be given in the DATASET name.   If the file
name contains a directory specification, it should be enclosed in quotes.
2 EXTENDED=boolean
This indicates whether the object spectrum is expected  to  be  extended
(rather  than  a  point  source).   It  is  used in conjunction with the
CONTINUUM parameter in determining  the  positions  and  widths  of  the
object  and  background channels used for spectrum extraction from HIRES
datasets.
2 GSAMP=number
This is the sampling rate used for spectrum extraction.  It is  measured
in  "geometric pixels".  GSAMP=1.414 corresponds to the original IUESIPS
(1) sampling rate,  while GSAMP=0.707 corresponds  to  the later IUESIPS
(2) sampling rate.  Other values can be chosen.
2 GSLIT=number[,number]
This is a pair of numbers delineating the object spectrum channel during
spectrum extraction.  The distances are measured in geometric pixels.

Negative distances mean "to the left of centre", and  positive distances
mean "to the right of centre".

Object channels that do NOT cover the actual object signal  on the image
will not be meaningful when centroid tracking is employed.

If only one value is defined, then this is taken as representing  a
channel that is symmetrical about the spectrum centre.

The spectrum "centre" is determined by  the  dispersion  relations, and
modified by any prevailing centroid shifts.
2 NORDER=number
This is the number of Echelle orders to be processed by a command.
2 ORDER=number
This is the Echelle order number.
1 UNIX_to_VAX_data_conversion

If you wish to transfer IUE image data from a UNIX machine onto a VAX
in order to use the VAX IUEDR then the transfer should be done
using FTP (in BINARY mode) and the command

      VAX_FORMAT  image-name

should then be used to ensure the file has the correct format.

If you use some other method of transferring the file (eg NFS) then
the above command is STILL required.
1 VAX_to_UNIX_data_conversion

If you wish to transfer IUE image data from a VAX onto a UNIX machine
in order to use the UNIX IUEDR then the transfer should be done
using FTP (in BINARY mode).

If you intend to copy the file using some other method (eg via NFS)
then you should first use the command

      UNIX_FORMAT image-name

to ensure the file is properly transferred.

Note that this also applies if you wish to just ACCESS the file via
NFS without explicitly transferring it.
