# Title:     LWP,RAW,LORES Faceplate Specification
# From:      Giddings (1982, Private Communication).
# Contents:  (RADIUS, SC, LC, ANGLE, RMIN, RMAX)
# Notes:     The circular specification of faceplate bounds is only
#            an approximation to a real IUE camera.
#            The RMIN and RMAX values are quite rough, measured from
#            ARGS.
