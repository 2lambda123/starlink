*  Name:
*     CHI_APPLY

*  Purpose:
*     Apply an expression to a set of data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CHI_APPLY( CVALS, DVALS, IVALS, LVALS, RVALS, NUMFLDS,
*               CVALUE, DVALUE, IVALUE, LVALUE, RVALUE, RESTYPE, 
*               STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine will not normally be required because all common uses of
*     the parser have been anticipated and included in other CHI routines.
*     CHI_SEARCH, CHI_REJECT, CHI_JOIN, CHI_UPDATE and CHI_CALCFLD call
*     the parser on you behalf. CHI_1PAR and CHI_2PAR give you direct access
*     to the parser when 1 or 2 catalogues are involved and must be called
*     before CHI_APPLY can be called. This routine applies the expression to
*     a set of data. Data must be of the correct type and supplied in the 
*     correct position as defined by CHI_1PAR or CHI_2PAR. CHI_1PAR and 
*     CHI_2PAR return the 
*     fieldnames and the fieldtypes which specify how the data is expected
*     for CHI_APPLY. If the FNAMES(1) is STARNAME and FTYPE(1) is character
*     then CHARVALS(1) must contain the the value of the STARNAME field as 
*     given in the next entry in the catalogue. If the FNAMES(3) is VALUE1 
*     and FTYPE(3) is real then REALVALS(3) must contain the the value of the 
*     VALUE1 field as given in the next entry in the catalogue. 
*     For ease of use the CHI_1PAR routine expects values in the same form 
*     CHI_GETVALALL returns so a CHI_1PAR followed by a sequence of 
*     CHI_GETVALALL and CHI_APPLY will produce the correct result.
