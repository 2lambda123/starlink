*  Name:
*     CHI_PUTENT

*  Purpose:
*     PUT an ENTry into a catalogue.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CHI_PUTENT( INPUT, CNAMES, NUMCOLS, CHECK, CHARVALS, DOUBVALS, 
*     INTVALS, LOGVALS, REALVALS, COLTYPES, NULLFLAGS, STATUS )
*
*  Description:
*     Add an entry to a catalogue. For each column name in CNAMES CHI_PUTENT
*     checks in respective position in COLTYPES to find the type of data. 
*     The data for this column in the entry will be taken from the respective 
*     element of the appropriate array unless the NULLFLAGS for this column is
*     TRUE indicating that the column is null. So if COLTYPES(3) is 'I' and 
*     NULLFLAGS(3) is FALSE then the data 
*     for the column whose name is given in CNAMES(3) will be taken from 
*     INTVALS(3).
*
*     There are four levels of checking which are selected using the argument
*     CHECK. Modes 1 and 2 are efficient and should be used whenever possible.
*     You are advised not to change the level of checking when putting data
*     into a catalogue unless you are moving to a mode where more checking is 
*     done
*
*     CHECK=1. The lowest level of checking. The routine processes the column 
*     names given in CNAMES. Only if the column appears in the catalogue and 
*     the type agrees with the that given in COLTYPES will data be put into
*     the column for this entry. All other columns take their null values. The
*     routine remembers where it found the data for each column (Eg. FLUX1 data
*     in REALVALS(5)). On subsequent calls the routine assumes that the FLUX1 
*     value will be in REALVALS(5). 
*
*     CHECK=2. The routine processes the column names given in CNAMES and only
*     if the all the columns in the catalogue are given in CNAMES and the
*     types are correct will the entry be put into the catalogue. If, during
*     checking, an error is found the error is reported and the name of the 
*     offending column is returned in CNAMES(1). Again after
*     the first call the routine remembers where it found the data for each 
*     column and on subsequent calls the routine assumes that the data will be
*     in the same place. This mode ensures that genuine data is put into the 
*     catalogue. Columns cannot be overlooked.
*
*     CHECK=3. In this mode the routine processes the column names given in 
*     CNAMES and their column types every time the routine is called. This 
*     means that different columns can contribute to each entry. Only if 
*     the column appears in the catalogue and 
*     the type agrees with that given in COLTYPES will data be put into
*     the column for this entry. All other column take their null values.
*
*     CHECK=4. Again in this mode the routine processes the column names given 
*     in CNAMES and their column types every time the routine is called.  Only
*     if the all the columns in the catalogue are given in CNAMES and the
*     types are correct will the entry be put into the catalogue.  If, during
*     checking, an error is found the error is reported and the name of the 
*     offending column is returned in CNAMES(1). Subsequent
*     calls to the routine may have the columns in CNAMES in a different order
*     but they must all be their and the respective column types must be 
*     correct.
*

*     CHARVALS( CHI__NUMCOLS ) = CHARACTER * ( CHI__SZCVAL ) (Returned)
*        Array containing the data for character columns.
*     COLTYPES( CHI__NUMCOLS ) = CHARACTER * ( 1 ) (Returned)
*        Array containing the types of columns.
*     NULLFLAGS( CHI__NUMCOLS ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
