      SUBROUTINE FK524( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FK524

*  Purpose:
*     Convert FK5 coordinates to FK4

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FK524( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Create a catalogue containing new fields for the Right Ascension,
*     Declination, Parallax, Radial velocity and proper motions after a 
*     conversion has been made from the FK5 system coordinates. The 
*     new fields are calculated using SLA_FK524. See SUN 67
* 
*     Conversion from Julian epoch 2000.0 to Besselian epoch 1950.0 only
*     is provided. Proper motion corrections can be made using PROPERM.
*
*     Proper motions should be given in sec/yr and arcsecs/yr
*     Parallax should be given in arcseconds.
*     Radial velocity should be given in km/sec (+ve if receeding)
*
*     If necessary use UPDATE to convert fields into the appropriate units.

*  Usage:
*     FK524 INPUT OUTPUT RAFK5 DECFK5 RAPMFK5 DECPMFK5 PARLXFK5 RADVELFK5
*     RAFK4 DECFK4 RAPMFK4 DECPMFK4 PARLXFK4 RADVELFK4

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     INPUT = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the catalogue.
*     OUTPUT = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the output catalogue.
*     RAFK5 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the RA field in FK5 system.
*     DECFK5 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the DEC field in FK5 system.
*     RAPMFK5 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the RA proper motion field in FK5 system.
*     DECPMFK5 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the DEC proper motion field in FK5 system.
*     PARLXFK5 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the parallax field in FK5 system.
*     RADVALFK5 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the radial velocity field in FK5 system.
*     RAFK4 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the RA field in FK4 system.
*     DECFK4 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the DEC field in FK4 system.
*     RAPMFK4 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the RA proper motion field in FK4 system.
*     DECPMFK4 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the DEC proper motion field in FK4 system.
*     PARLXFK4 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the parallax field in FK4 system.
*     RADVALFK4 = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the radial velocity field in FK4 system.

*  Example:
*     FK524 TEST TESTFK4 RA DEC RAPM DECPM PARALLAX RAD_VEL RAB DECB 
*     RAPMB DECPMB PARALLAXB RADVELB

*  Notes:
*     This application creates a new catalogue that contains extra fields for
*     Right Ascension, Declination, Parallax, Radial velocity and proper 
*     motions after a conversion to FK4 system.
*     The naming of these new fields can lead to confusion. Traditionally
*     the field names RA and DEC are used for the Right Ascension and 
*     Declination fields in the catalogue. It is stongly suggested that the
*     field names of Right Ascension and Declination in the new system (FK4)
*     take the form RAB, DECB for RA Besselian and DEC Besselian. In the same 
*     way PARLX would become PARLXB and RADVEL RADVELB etc. You may go on to 
*     rename the field RA to RAJ and DEC to DECJ and RAB to RA and DECB to DEC 
*     using the UPFIELD application but you must also then update the Parallax,
*     Radial velocity and proper motions and the catalogues Equinox parameter.
*     
*     Care should also be taken when renaming fields. Renaming RAB to RA 
*     before renaming RA to RAJ, in the above example, would result in two 
*     fields named RA in the same catalogue.
