 The CATPAC package of catalogue manipulation applications has been
 made available on Unix.   CATPAC provides some of the functionality
 of SCAR, pending a Unix replacement for SCAR.

 To start CATPAC from the shell type:

        % catpac
 or
        % catpacsetup

 (where % is the shell promt).

 CATPAC also runs under ICL, and should be loaded as follows:

        ICL> load $CATPAC_DIR/catpac

 Please report any problems to ussc@star.rl.ac.uk.
