*  Name:
*     CHP_GONECD

*  Purpose:
*     Get ONE Columns Details.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CHP_GONECD(INPUT, NAME, FORMAT, UNITS, COMMENT, PREFDIS,
*     COLTYPE, COLDES, ARRSHP, ARRDIM, ASSERT, ASSEXP, DOMCHK, MDATAACC,
*     DATAACC, DATELM, VCFLAG, VCEXP, DELIND, FMATFLAG, STATUS)

*  Description :
*     Get the information about a column in a catalogue. A column has associated
*     with it a name, format, units, comment, preferred display flag, type, 
*     column designator, array shape, array dimensions, assert flag, assert 
*     expression, domain check flag, access information, date last modified, 
*     virtual column flag, virtual column expression, delete indicator, 
*     standard format flag. For any column some of these will have no
*     meaning.
*
*     COLDES is the column designator which allows the column to be interpreted
*     correctly. 
*
*     COLDES = 1 This is a scalar column, if it is a character string it
*     is CHP__SZCVAL long. VCEXP and ASSEXP may have no meaning. ARRSHP and 
*     ARRDIM have no meaning.
*
*     COLDES = 2 This is a structure column. FORMAT, 
*     UNITS, ARRSHP, ARRDIM, ASSERT, ASSEXP, DOMCHK, VCFLAG, VCEXP
*     and FMATFLAG have no meaning.
*
*     COLDES = 3 This is an array column whose size is the same for all 
*     entries. Character string are always CHP__SZCVAL long.  
*     ASSERT, ASSEXP, DOMCHK, VCFLAG, VCEXP and FMATFLAG have no meaning.
*
*     COLDES = 4 This is an array whose shape and dimensions may vary from
*     entry to entry. Character string are always CHP__SZCVAL long.
*     ARRSHP, ARRDIM, ASSERT, ASSEXP, DOMCHK, VCFLAG, VCEXP and FMATFLAG have 
*     no meaning.
*
*     COLDES = 5 This is a scalar column. It is a variable length character 
*     string. FORMAT, ARRSHP, ARRDIM, ASSERT, ASSEXP, DOMCHK, VCFLAG, VCEXP
*     and FMATFLAG have no meaning.
*
*     COLDES = 6 This is an array column of character string whose shape, 
*     dimensions and string length may vary from entry to entry.
*     FORMAT, ARRSHP, ARRDIM, ASSERT, ASSEXP, DOMCHK, VCFLAG, VCEXP
*     and FMATFLAG have no meaning.
*

*     ARRDIM( 7 )  = INTEGER (Given)
*        Array dimensions.
*     ASSERT = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Assert flag. TRUE if an assert expresion is present.
*     ASSEXP = CHARACTER * ( CHI__SZCEXP ) (Returned)
*        Assert expression.
*     DOMCHK = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Domain checking flag. TRUE if domain checking is active.
*     MDATAACC = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Access to metadata associated with the column.
*     DATAACC = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Access to data associated with the column.
*     DATELM  = INTEGER (Given)
*        Date that the column was last modified.
*     VCFLAG = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Virtual column flag. TRUE for a virtual column.
*     VCEXP = CHARACTER * ( CHI__SZCEXP ) (Returned)
*        Virtual column expressions.
*     DELIND = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Delete indicator flag. TRUE if the column can be deleted.
*     FMATFLAG = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Format flag. TRUE if a non standard format is present.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status.
