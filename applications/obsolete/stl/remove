#     remove_cmd

#  Purpose:
#     Generate a C-shell command to remove a directory from the search
#     path.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script will write a C-shell command to the standard output
#     which, when executed, will remove a specified directory from the
#     search path. If a closedown file exists in this directory, the
#     generated command will first source this file.

#  Arguments:

#	 Name of the directory which is to be removed from the search
#	 path (as defined by the PATH environment variable).

#  Use awk to split up the PATH value into fields and to print only
#  those fields which do not match the directory to be removed. The new
#  fields are separated by ':'s, thus giving the new PATH value.
      newpath=`echo $PATH | \
awk -F: '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)if($i!="'${*}'"){if(l!="")l=l":";l=l$i}print l}'`

#  Add the command to update the PATH environment variable.
      cmd="${cmd}setenv PATH ${newpath}"

#  Send the resulting command to standard output and quit.
      echo "$cmd"
