*+  GEN_BSMOTHQ - Smooth a 1-D REAL array with a simple moving box filter.
      SUBROUTINE GEN_BSMOTHQ( NELM, INPUT, INQUAL, BOXSIZE, OUTPUT,
     :  OUTQUAL, QUALITY, FLAGGED, FBAD, STATUS ) 
*    Description :
*     This routine smooths a 1-D REAL array with a moving box filter
*     with the given box size. The filter uses a very simple top-hat
*     function. If data quality information is provided, bad values in
*     the input array are ignored. The output array will contain a bad
*     value whenever a smoothed value cannot be calculated.
*
*     Note that this is a much cruder and heavier smooth than the one
*     used in GEN_ASMOTH, and it only applies to 1-D arrays.
*    Invocation :
*      CALL GEN_BSMOTHQ( NELM, INPUT, INQUAL, BOXSIZE, OUTPUT, 
*     :  OUTQUAL, QUALITY, FLAGGED, FBAD, STATUS ) 
*    Parameters :
*     NELM                 = INTEGER( READ )
*        The dimension of the array.
*     INPUT( NELM )        = REAL( READ )
*        The input array to be smoothed.
*     INQUAL( NELM )       = BYTE( READ )
*        The quality of the input array. This is only used if
*        QUALITY is .TRUE.
*     BOXSIZE              = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*        On input this should be the size of box required.
*        On output it will contain the size of the box actually used.
*        BOXSIZE should be an odd number but if an even number is given
*        it will be rounded up to the nearest odd number (BOXSIZE+1).
*        The maximum BOXSIZE allowed is NELM/2, and larger values will
*        be truncated.
*     OUTPUT( NELM )       = REAL( WRITE )
*        The smoothed version of the array.
*        NOTE THE OUTPUT ARRAY CANNOT BE THE SAME AS THE INPUT ARRAY.
*     OUTQUAL( NELM )      = BYTE( WRITE )
*        The quality of the output array. This is only used if
*        QUALITY is .TRUE.
*     QUALITY              = LOGICAL( READ )
*        Indicates if a data quality array is to be used.
*     FLAGGED              = LOGICAL( READ )
*        Indicates if magic, flagged values are to be used.
*     FBAD                 = REAL( READ )
*        The magic bad value used. This is only used if FLAGGED is .TRUE.
*     STATUS               = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*        Global ADAM status.
*    Method :
*    Deficiencies :
*     This routine uses a very naive and inefficient algorithm.
*     It would be quicker to use a geniune moving box, subtracting
*     values from the left hand side and adding them to the right.
*     However, the routine will work reasonably well for small
*     data sets.
*     Figaro provides some much better smoothing routines, but this one
*     was produced because it provides a very simple way of smoothing a
*     1-D histogram.
*     Variances are not handled.
