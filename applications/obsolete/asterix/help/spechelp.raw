1 1_SPECTRAL_MODELS

    The object of this help library is to both explain the background behind
  each spectral model available and to indicate where further information
  may be found.
    Additional explanation of the input parameters required for each model
  is given in order that the limitations of each model can be recognised.

2 AB_(Intrinsic_absorption)

  This model calculates the intrinsic absorption due to the ISM from the
  interstellar absorption model of Morrison & McCammon. This does not
  include a contribution from Compton scattering (since this is not a loss
  process for intrinsic absorption) or the effects of grains.
  For redshifted spectra the absorption is also redshifted (i.e. into
  the source frame). For absorption in our own galaxy (not redhsifted)
  use the AG model. The two are almost identical for z=0.
  The routine returns an array of energy dependent attenuation factors
  calculated from,
                          FAC=exp(-SIG(E)*NH)
  where SIG(E) is the absorption cross-section at energy E.
  This is a multiplicative model.

3 Parameters

  NH - The hydrogen column density in units of 1.0e21 /cm**2.
       Default value is 1.0 with a range 0.0 - 20.0.

3 Problems/limitations

  a) Below 0.03 keV SIG(E) is assumed to be proportional to E**-3, although
     this is only an approximation.

  b) For E>100 keV the Klein-Nishina scattering cross-section should be
     used.

2 AC_(Cyclotron_absorption)

   This model uses the cyclotron absorption function to approximate the
   optical depth of the cyclotron resonance scattering in a uniform
   magnetic field.
   The cyclotron absorption function is :
                   exp (-D*(E**2)/((E-Ea)**2+W**2)
   This is a multiplicative model.

3 Parameters

  a) D - The Thomson absorption depth for E >> Ea (dimensionless).
         Default value = 1.0 with range 0.01 - 10.0.

  b) Ea - Non-relativistic cyclotron energy in keV.
          (This equals 11.6(B/10**12 Gauss) keV).
          Default value = 12.0 with range 0.0 - 100.0.

  c) W - Artificial resonance width in keV.
         Default value = 1.0 with range 0.01 - 10.0.

2 AG_(Galactic_absorption)

   This routine is similar to SPEC_AB in that it returns an array of
   energy dependent attenuation factors due to the interstellar absorption
   of Morrison & McCammon, but with the addition that Compton scattering
   is included (which is significant for E>5 keV).
   The Thomson scattering cross-section due to H & He is also accounted
   for since it is significant even at low energies. The effect of grains
   is ignored.
   The absorption factors are given by :
                     FAC = exp (-SIG(E)*NH)
   This is a multiplicative model.

3 Parameters

  NH - The hydrogen column density, units 1.0e21 cm**-2.
       Default = 1.0 with range of 0.0 - 20.0.

3 Problems/limitations

  a) Below 0.03 keV SIG(E) is assumed to be proportional to
     E**-3 (an approximation).

  b) For E>100 keV the Klein-Nishina scattering cross-section
     should be used.

2 AP_(Partial_covering_absorption)

  This model is similar to SPEC_AB in that it returns an array of energy
  dependent attenuation factors due to interstellar absorption, without
  contributions from grains and from Compton scattering. The difference
  is that this assumes that only a fraction F of the source is covered.
  The attenuation factor is :
              FAC = F * exp(-SIG(E)*NH) + (1-F)
  where SIG(E) is the photoelectric cross-section.
  Note that for a redshifted source the absorption model (edges) is set
  up in the source frame.
  This is a multiplicative model.

3 Parameters

  a) NH - The H column density with units 1.0E21 cm-**2.
          Default = 1.0 with range 0.0 - 20.0.

  b) F - The covering fraction.
         Default = 0.9 with range 0.01 - 1.0.

3 Problems/limitations

  a) Below 0.03 keV sigma is assumed to be proportional to E**-3.
     (This is an approximation).

  b) At E>100 keV the Klein-Nishina scattering cross-section should be used.

2 AV_(Variable_abundance_absorption)

  This model calculates the absorption due to a medium containing neutral
  atoms with variable abundances, based on the work of Balucinska-Church &
  McCammon.

  A set of functions calculate the photoelectric cross sections for the
  elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Cl, A, Ca, Cr, Fe, and
  Ni, which are combined to give the total cross section.
  This cross section SIG(E) is then used to derive an array of energy
  dependent attenuation factors,
                      FAC(E)=exp(-SIG(E)*NH).

  Parameter 1 specifies the column density of neutral H, and parameters
  2-18 give the relative logarithmic abundances of the various elements.
  When the model is invoked these abundances are all initially frozen at
  their cosmic values.

  Nonstandard values of abundances may be easily calculated as follows.
  For example, suppose we wish to have 1/10 the cosmic abundance of
  iron.
     Log cosmic abundance of Fe = 7.52
     Abundance (in units relative to H) = 10**7.52
     Hence reduced  log abundance is 6.52

  The model is valid for the photon energy range 30 eV to 10,000 eV.
  For discussion of accuracy, see Balucinska-Church and McCammon (1992).
  For redshifted sources, the absorption is in the source frame.

  WARNING:  PARAM(2) should NOT normally be changed.  Users should
  be warned that changing it does NOT result in changing the column
  of hydrogen. As the abundances of the other elements are relative
  to H, varying PARAM(2) will, in fact, have the effect of varying
  the abundances of all the other elements by the same factor.
  E.g. DECREASING PARAM(2) from 12 to 11 will result in INCREASING
  the column of helium and the metals by a factor of 10.
  So, varying this parameter only might be a useful way of changing
  all parameters from PARAM(3) to PARAM(18) by a certain factor, but
  this should be done with caution and a full understanding of the
  consequences.

  If standard abundances are to be used, it is better to use the AB model
  implementing the polynomial representation of Morrison and McCammon
  (Ap. J., 270, 119 (1983)).  This executes much faster than the variable
  abundance model, but gives the same results as the variable abundance
  model called with cosmic abundances.

  This is a multiplicative model.

2 BB_(Black_body)

  This model returns the flux in each energy bin, as delimited by the
  chosen boundaries, for a black-body model.
  The equation used is :
                   A*0.80525*(E**2)/(T**4*(exp(E/T)-1 ))
  With this normalisation the norm A corresponds to luminosity/distance**2

  input boundaries, for a hydrogen bremsstrahlung spectrum.
  The equation used is :
                   A * g(E,T) * E**-1 * exp(-E/T)
  where g(E,T) is the Gaunt factor for a fully ionised hydrogen plasma,
  as derived by Karzas & Latter (1961).
  A more accurate (and complex) model is SPEC_BR.
  This is an additive model.

2 BP_(Pseudo_bremss)

  This model returns the flux in each energy bin, delimited by the input
  bounds, using a simple thermal bremsstrahlung equation.
  The form of this is :
                    A * E**(-g) * exp(-E/T)
  where g is the Gaunt index (1.4 roughly corresponds to a thermal
  bremsstrahlung model).
  Note that this is exactly the same as the cutoff power law although
  the starting parameter values are likely to differ.
  This is an additive model.

3 Parameters

  a) A - Normalisation constant with units of photons/(cm**2*s*keV)
         Default = 0.1 with range 0.0001 - 10.0.

  c) T - Temperature in keV.
         Default = 5.0 with range 0.1 - 20.0.

2 BR_(Thermal_bremss)

  This returns the photon fluxes in the energy channels, delimited by the
  input bounds, for a thermal bremsstrahlung model which includes various
  corrections important at the ~10% level for a hot (1E8 K) plasma.
  The formula used is :
               em10 * g(E,T) * E**-1 * exp(-E/T)
  where g(E,T) is the Gaunt index.
  This is an additive model.

3 Parameters

            of 1E60 cm**3/10kpc**2.
            Default = 1.0 with range of 0.0001 - 10.0.

  b) T - Temperature in keV.
         Default = 5.0 with range 0.1 - 20.0.

3 Problems/limitations

  The approximations made by Gould are valid only for a hot (1E7-1E9 K)
  plasma and should be treated with care for cooler plasmas.

2 CF_(Cooling_flow)

  This model determines the photon flux emitted from a hot plasma cooling
  steadily at constant pressure.
  The spectrum is synthesized from a superposition of Raymond and Smith
  spectra, each derived by interpolation (over temperature and ,if
  necessary, energy) from a precalculated grid (see SPEC_RZ).
  The required equation is :
                 F(E) = L(E)/(4 * pi * d**2 * Eerg)
  where L(E) is the spectral luminosity in these circumstances, d is the
  source distance (cm) and Eerg is the photon energy (ergs).
  The spectral luminosity is determined via :
           L(E) = (5*k*Mdot)/(2*m)*Int_O~Tmax{(X(E,t)/X(T))*dT}
  where Mdot is the mass cooling rate, m the mean particle mass, X(E,T)
  the spectral emissivity at temp T and X(T)=Int_O~inf{X(E,T)*dE} is the
  total emissivity at temp T.
  This is an additive model.

3 Parameters

  a) A - Mdot/d**2 which has units of 10Msol p.a. at 100 Mpc.
         Default = 1.0 with range of 0.001 - 1000.0.

  b) Tmax - Temperature from which gas is cooling in keV.
            Default = 5.0 with range of 0.1 - 15.0.

  c) Z - Metallicity in solar units.
         Default = 1.0 with range of 0.0 - 10.0.

3 Problems/limitations

  Note that the assumption of 'constant pressure' requires, in the context
  of cooling flows, that the gravitational potential change through the
  flow is negligible (compared to the thermal energy of the gas). If this
  is not true then (for a certain Mdot) extra luminosity will be fed into
  the temperature phases where the potential gradient is important.
  If the pressure actually is constant then the spectrum is applicable
  even in the case where the flow is 'multiphase'.

2 CS_(Comptonised_bremss)

  The thermal bremsstrahlung emission is evaluated by Gould's thermal
  bremsstrahlung formula.
  The effects of self-Comptonization on this emission is then found
  using Chapline & Stevens formula, for an optically thick spherical
  plasma cloud, with specified optical thickness and temperature.
  This is an additive model.

3 Parameters

  a) em10 - Emission measure with units of 1E60 cm-**3/(10kpc)**2.
            Default = 1.0 with range 0.0001 - 10.0.

  b) T - Plasma temperature in keV.
         Default = 5.0 with range 0.5 - 20.0.

  c) OPD - Optical depth.
           Default = 10.0 with range 0.1 - 20.0.

3 Problems/limitations

  This model is only valid if OPD < [(m*c**2)/(2*kT)]**0.5.

2 EC_(Exponential_cutoff)

  This model provides a high energy exponential cutoff with the cutoff
  energy being input.
  The formula used is :
                       exp ((Ec-E)/Ef)      for E>Ec
                               1            for E<Ec.
  Output flux has units photons/cm**2/s.
  This is a multiplicative model.

3 Parameters

          Default = 10.0 with range 0.0 - 50.0.

2 ED_(Absorption_edge)

  This routine provides an absorption edge above a certain threshold
  energy.
  Formula used is :
                   exp (-D*(Et/E)**3)    for E>=Et

  from a Gaussian spectral line model.
  Formula used is :
                  A * exp[(El-E)**2/(2*W**2)] / W*Sqrt(2*PI).
  This is an additive model.

3 Problems/limitations

  Note that if the line width is less than zero then a delta function
  will be adopted and that if the line width energy is not >> than the
  line width then some of the line flux will be lost to negative
  energies.

3 Parameters

  a) A - Line flux in units of photons/cm**2/s.
         Default = 0.1 with range 0.0001 - 10.0.

  bounds, from a Lorentzian spectral line model.
  The flux is calculated via :
                    (A*W/PI) / [(E-El)**2 + W**2]
  which has units of photons/cm**2/s.
  This is an additive model.

3 Parameters

         Default = 0.1 with range 0.0001 - 10.0.

  b) El - Line centre energy in keV.
          Default = 6.7 with range 0.0 - 30.0.

         Default = 1.0 with range 0.01 - 10.0.

3 Problems/limitations

  If W=0 then a delta function line is adopted.
  If El is not >> W then some of the line flux will be lost to negative
  energies.

2 MDM_(Diff_emission_measure_MEKAL)

  This model returns the flux in each energy channel from a differential
  emission measure model defined by DCM=cT**a between two cut-off
  temperatures. The underlying plasma code is the MEKAL code.

  Returned flux has units of photons/(cm**2*s*keV).
  Note also that an MEKAL grid matching the instrument response MUST be used.
  This is an additive model.

3 Parameters

            Default = 0.01 with range of 1.0E-4 - 10.0.

  b) Slope - Slope of the DEM power law.
             Default = 0.0 with range -2.0 - 2.0.

  e) Metals - Metal abundance in solar units.
              Default = 1.0 with range 0.0 - 10.0.

2 MK_(MEKAL_hot_plasma)

 This returns the flux in each energy channel, delimited by bounds,
 from the hot, optically thin MEKAL plasma model. The calculation uses
 an MKL grid binned up to match the instrument response and the object
 redshift (if such a grid exists). Returned flux has units of
 photons/cm**2/s/keV.<p>

 Note that the models are precalculated and stored in a cube, whose
 axes are photon energy, element abundance and temperature.<p>

 The abundance dimension contains 2 values,
 corresponding to spectra for (1) the H and He spectrum, and
 (2) the contributions from 13 heavier elements (listed) individually.
 The elements used and their log (number) abundances relative to H=12
 are : He(10.99), C(8.56), N(8.05), O(8.93), Ne(8.09), Na(6.33),
 Mg(7.58), Al(6.47), Si(7.55), S(7.21), Ar(6.56), Ca(6.36), Fe(7.67),
 Ni(6.25).<p>

 Recently it was noted that significant differences existed between
 MEKAL thermal plasma  codes  of ASTERIX and XSPEC. This is being
 investigated.<p>

 The requested model is computed from the values in the cube by linear
 interpolation over temperature, and by scaling of elements relative to
 their cosmic abundances. All elements heavier than He are amalgamated
 into 'metals' for the MK model.<p>

 Note that the emissivity grid has to be multiplied by Ne*NH*Volume to
 get radiated power.<p>

 This is an additive model.<p>


3 Parameters

  a) em10 - Emission measure/distance**2 with units 1E60cm**-3/10kpc**2.
            Default = 1.0 with range 0.0001 - 10.0.

  b) T - Plasma temperature in keV.
         Default = 1.0 with range 0.088 - 17.0.

  c) Metals - Metal abundance relative to H in units of cosmic abundance.
              Default = 1.0 with range 0.0 - 10.0.

3 Problems/limitations

  The code used will automatically search the default MK grid directory
  and check every grid found against the energy bounds of the dataset to
  be fitted. The first matching grid will be used which means that two
  grids identical apart from different kT ranges cannot be resolved.
  The best solution is to place the grid to be fitted in a directory
  apart from the other grids and assign the directory logical (SPEC_DIR)
  to this directory.

2 RZ_(R&S_hot_plasma)

 This returns the flux in each energy channel, delimited by bounds
 from the hot, optically thin plasma models of Raymond & Smith. The
 calculation uses an RS grid binned up to match the instrument response
 and the object redshift (if such a grid exists).
 Returned flux has units of photons/cm**2/s/keV.<p>

 Note that the models are precalculated and stored in a cube, whose
 axes are photon energy, element abundance and temperature.<p>

 The abundance dimension contains 2 values,
 corresponding to spectra for (1) the H and He spectrum, and
 (2) the contributions from 13 heavier elements (listed) individually.
 The elements used and their log (number) abundances relative to H=12
 are : He(10.99), C(8.56), N(8.05), O(8.93), Ne(8.09), Na(6.33),
 Mg(7.58), Al(6.47), Si(7.55), S(7.21), Ar(6.56), Ca(6.36), Fe(7.67),
 Ni(6.25).<p>

 Recently it was noted that significant differences existed between
 Raymond and Smith (RZ) thermal plasma  codes  of ASTERIX and XSPEC.<p>

 The difference between Raymond and Smith (RZ) codes can be attributed
 to the differing values of solar abundances used in ASTERIX and XSPEC.<p>

 The ASTERIX code used the abundances (Allen 1973) originally used in
 the Raymond & Smith (1977) paper. These are now out of date, and the
 XSPEC code allows a choice of the Anders and Grevesse (1989) (Default)
 or the Feldman (1992) abundance ratios.<p>

 In order to agree with XSPEC the default ASTERIX RZ_CUBE has been
 changed to Anders and Gervesse values.<p>

 However a copy of the older RZ cube can be obtained by ftp :<p>

 ftp ftp.sr.bham.ac.uk
 cd /pub/asterix/etc
 rz_old_cube.sdf<p>

 OBELIX (local) users can access the RZ_CUBE by resetting an
 environment variable: <p>

 RZ_CUBE /soft/asterix/asterix-2.3/sun4_Solaris/etc/rz_old_cube.sdf<p>

 In the old ASTERIX cube the abundance dimension contained 2 values,
 corresponding to spectra for :
 (1) the H and He spectrum, and
 (2) the contributions from 13 heavier elements (listed) individually.
 The elements used and their log (number) abundances relative to H=12
 are : He(10.93), C(8.52), N(7.96), O(8.82), Ne(7.92), Na(n/a),
 Mg(7.42), Al(n/a), Si(7.52), S(7.20), Ar(6.90), Ca(6.30), Fe(7.60),
 Ni(6.30).<p>

 The requested model is computed from the values in the cube by linear
 interpolation over temperature, and by scaling of elements relative to
 their cosmic abundances. All elements heavier than He are amalgamated
 into 'metals' for the MK model.<p>

 Note that the emissivity grid has to be multiplied by Ne*NH*Volume to
 get radiated power.<p>

 This is an additive model.<p>

3 Parameters

  a) em10 - Emission measure/distance**2 with units 1E60cm**-3/10kpc**2.
            Default = 1.0 with range 0.0001 - 10.0.

  b) T - Plasma temperature in keV.
         Default = 1.0 with range 0.088 - 17.0.

  c) Metals - Metal abundance relative to H in units of cosmic abundance.
              Default = 1.0 with range 0.0 - 10.0.

3 Problems/limitations

  The code used will automatically search the default RS grid directory
  and check every grid found against the energy bounds of the dataset to
  be fitted. The first matching grid will be used which means that two
  grids identical apart from different kT ranges cannot be resolved.
  The best solution is to place the grid to be fitted in a directory
  apart from the other grids and assign the directory logical (SPEC_DIR)
  to this directory.

2 ST_(Sunyaev-Titarchuk_comptonised)

  This model returns the flux in each energy channel, delimited by bounds,
  for a Sunyaev-Titarchuk comptonisation model, which describes the
  comptonisation of cool photons on hot electrons.
  This is an additive model.

3 Parameters

  a) A - Normalisation constant with units of photons/cm**2/s/keV.
         Default = 0.1 with range 0.0001 - 10.0.

  b) T - Temperature in keV.
         Default = 5.0 with range 0.5 - 30.0.

  c) OPD - Optical depth of medium.
.          Default = 10.0 with range 2.5 - 30.0.

3 Problems/limitations

  Setting the temperature to less than about 0.5keV will very likely cause
  this routine to crash, regardless of the values of the other parameters.
  Setting the optical depth to less than about 2.5 will also cause problems
  if the temperature is a few keV or less.
  It is recommended that the default lower limits are not changed.

2 WN_(Wien)

  This returns the flux in each energy channel, delimited by bounds,
  for a Wien spectrum.
  The formula used is :
                       A * E**2 * exp(-E/T).
  Note that this is almost identical to a black-body spectrum for E>>T.
  This is an additive model.

3 Parameters

  a) A - Normalisation constant with units photons/cm**2/s/keV.
         Default = 0.01 with range 0.0001 - 1.0.

  b) T - Temperature in keV.
         Default = 1.0 with range 0.1 - 8.0.
