#  Name:
#     hed_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against HED package.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building standalone applications 
#     which use the ASTERIX HED package in order to generate the correct
#     arguments for the compiler (or ld) command. The arguments
#     generated are written to the standard output.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a compiler command line,
#     such as:
#
#        alink program.f `hed_link_adam` `ast_link_adam`
