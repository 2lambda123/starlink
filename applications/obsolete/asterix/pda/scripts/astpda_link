#  Name:
#     astpda_link

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking standalone version
#     of Asterix PDA library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building standalone
#     applications which use PDA in order to generate the correct

#     generated are written to the standard output.

#  Invocation:

#     such as:
#
#        f77 -o program -L/star/lib `astpda_link` program.f
