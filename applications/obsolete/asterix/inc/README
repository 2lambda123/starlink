Most, hopefully all necessary include file have been put here, though
this is not there intended place of residence. It makes compiling
easier with the flag -I/star/asterix/kernel/lib/inc

The two commands to_struc and to_comm swap over some of the include
files depending upon whether compilation for Linux (comm) or Solaris/OSF
(struc) is required.

Eventually only the comm flavour will be required when the full Linux
port is finished.
