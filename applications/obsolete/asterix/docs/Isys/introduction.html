Isys is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the Asterix Image Processing System and is built using Tcl/Tk and Starlink extensions to this.  It is not just a wrap-up of the command-based applications and many of the underlying applications are aware of being run from the GUI and consequently exhibit enhanced behaviour. <BR><BR>
Both HDS and FITS image <A HREF="opening-files.html">files</A> can be read and it also handles <A HREF="3D-data.html">cubes</A>.  Several <A HREF="1D-data.html">1D products</A> can be produced from the image and these are able to be saved an reread in subsequent sessions.  Astrometry is handled where present.  <BR><BR>
As well as processing the image there is comprehensive <A HREF="formatting-plots.html">formatting</A> of the way the data are plotted.  There are also interfaces to <A HREF="source-searching.html">PSS</A>, the Asterix point source searching application, and to remote <A HREF="using-catalogues.html">catalogue</A> access.<BR><BR>
To use this guide, you can work from the <A HREF="contents.html">contents</A> page, always accessible from the button at the bottom of the page, or you can take a predefined tour using the <I>Next</I> and <I>Previous</I> buttons.
