                           ASTHELP V 1.5
                           =============

ASTHELP has been implemented on top of the Starlink portable
help system (SUN124).  It is invoked via a FORTRAN programme
which calls the Starlink HELP subroutines.  As well as the
normal hierarchical structure, facilities have been added
which allow a hypertext-like feel to be included.  This is
achieved by having a separate index file which associates
keywords with the path to a help topic.  These keywords are
invoked from within the ASTHELP session using the syntax
described in the Using_ASTHELP section of help.  At present
this index file (AST_ROOT:[HELP]ASTHELP.INDEX) is a simple
text file and keywords are located by a linear search.  If
it grows to the point where this becomes too slow, then we
can implement it using direct access files and binary searching.
With this in mind new entries should be placed in alphabetic
order.  Use upper case for command names and lower case for
other things.  To indicate to users of ASTHELP what keywords
are available, they can be highlighted where they occur in
the text by enclosing them as follows: -<keyword>- .  The 
ASTHELP programme replaces the -< >- by ANSI escape sequences.

The full help text is to be found in ASTHELP.HLP (we may want to
break this down into smaller files some time) and the command file,
REPHELP in the same directory will compile this into the help
library, ASTHELP.SHL (this takes some time!).

The full list of files associated with ASTHELP are:

    AST_ROOT:[HELP] ASTHELP.HLP      help text
                    ASTHELP.SHL      help library
                    ASTHELP.INDEX    index file
                    REPHELP.COM      builds library
                    ASTHELP.EXE      ASTHELP programme
                    ASTHELP.FOR      source for above
                    ASTHELP.COM      build programme
