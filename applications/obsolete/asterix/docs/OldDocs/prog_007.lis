    Introduction

    The GRAFIX Control Block (GCB) is a structure which can be appended
    to any ASTERIX binned dataset and which contains attributes
    which control the way the GRAFIX system plots the contents of
    that dataset.  Applications are provided within ASTERIX to edit
    the attributes but they may also want to be set directly by user
    applications.  For example an application that produces a
    frequency distribution may wish to set the appropriate attribute
    such that the dataset produced gets plotted by default in a
    histogram style.  All manipulation of the attributes is done
    through subroutines and the following is a description of those
    subroutines.  A description of the objects within the GCB is also
    provided but applications should not make direct reference to these
    as they may change in the future.



    Subroutines

      Three groups of subroutines are provided.  The GCB_GETx routines
      obtain the current state and value of the attribute if set.  The
      GCB_PUTx routines write values into the attributes , creating
      them first if necessary.  The GCB_CANx routines cancel the attribute
      such that plotting applications pick their own default values.
      A list of all the routines followed by a more detailed description
      of their function is now given.

    Control Block contents

      The attributes for individual graphs reside within the structure

          dataset.MORE.ASTERIX.GRAFIX

      and fall into the three groups that follow.  Not all attributes or
      sub-attributes have to be present - absence is the equivalent of
      being in an unset or cancelled state.
