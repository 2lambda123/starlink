                       The AXIS_ routines
                       ==================
Version 1.0
David Allan (4/7/90)

  The AXIS_ routines perform manipulations specific to Asterix axis
  structures and data.

  The first five of these routines use the AXIS LABELs in a binned dataset
  to obtain the index number (for use in BDA_ routines) of an axis with a
  particular label. 

  If the specified axis is found, then AXDIM (or X_AXIS, Y_AXIS, T_AXIS) is
  set to the index number of that axis. If no matches are found, then a
  value of 0 is returned. If N matches are made (N > 1), then a value of -N
  is returned. 

  The new routines are:-
    N.B. arguments to the left of the ; are imports & to the right are
         exports. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*+ AXIS_GET - Finds axis; asks user if can't do it automatically.
      SUBROUTINE AXIS_GET (LOC, SUB_STRING, PARNAME, NDIM; AXDIM,
     :                                                           STATUS) 

      This routine calls AXIS_FIND. If the axis is NOT found, or more than
      one match is made, then the relevant axis labels are displayed
      together with their index numbers, and the user is asked to choose
      which axis to use. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*+ AXIS_FIND - Returns index number of axis with label containing SUB_STRING.
      SUBROUTINE AXIS_FIND (LOC, SUB_STRING, NDIM; AXDIM, STATUS)

      This routine looks for the axis label containing the sub string
      SUB_STRING. SUB_STRING must therefore be chosen carefully! 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*+ AXIS_FINDXYT - Find the X, Y, and T axes, if possible.
      SUBROUTINE AXIS_FINDXYT (LOC, NDIM; X_AXIS, Y_AXIS, T_AXIS,
     :                                                           STATUS) 

      This routine looks for X_CORR, Y_CORR, & TIMETAG labels. If it fails
      it will look for the X_RAW, Y_RAW, & RAW_TIMETAG labels as
      appropriate. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*+ AXIS_LIST - Lists the axes of the data array with their labels.
      SUBROUTINE AXIS_LIST (LOC, NDIM; STATUS)

      This routine displays to the user the axis labels, together with
      their index numbers. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*+ AXIS_LISTMATCH - Lists axes with labels containing SUB_STRING.
      SUBROUTINE AXIS_LISTMATCH (LOC, SUB_STRING, NDIM; STATUS)

      This routine displays to the user the axis labels containing the sub
      string SUB_STRING, together with their index numbers. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*+ AXIS_VAL2PIX - Translates range spec to pixel values 
      SUBROUTINE AXIS_VAL2PIX( DIM, AXVAL, RLO, RHI ; PLO, PHI, STATUS )

      Locates a range specified in axis values in pixels. The bound
      specified by RLO is inclusive, that by RHI is exclusive.
