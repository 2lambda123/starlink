1  INTRODUCTION

ASTERIX applications are organised into ADAM shared  image  monoliths.
Each  monolith  contains a group of related applications, for instance
spectral  analysis  programs.   Fortran  source   files   are   stored
separately  for each monolith in subdirectories below [.SOURCE].  They
are held in text libraries and there is a corresponding object library
for  each monolith.  The only other source files are held in a library
called ASTLIB which is held in [.LIB].   This  is  a  general  library
which applications from all monoliths link into.  All the files needed
to run ASTERIX monoliths are contained in [.EXE].  These  include  the
executable  code for the monoliths as well as compiled interface files
and ICL command definition files.  Individual Atask  versions  of  the
applications  reside in a subdirectory of this called [.TASKS] and ICL
procedures are held in the [.PROCS] subdirectory.

The whole directory structure is set  up  as  a  substructure  of  the
pseudo-device  AST_ROOT:   which  points  to  an  [ASTERIX.] directory
level, whose location is system dependent.

3  SUBDIRECTORY CONTENTS

3.1  [.DATA]

Contains instrument specific data, such  as  calibration  and  orbital
element  files.   The  data for each satellite is stored in a separate
subdirectory e.g.  [.EXOSAT].  These are  the  default  locations  for
these  data  files and individual sites may choose to redefine logical
names to point elsewhere.



3.2  [.DEV]

Routines  to  help  in  the  development  of  ASTERIX,  divided   into
subdirectories as follows.

ASTERIX/88/001.3                                                Page 3


3.2.1  [.INCLUDE] -

Header  templates  for  different  types  of  file  e.g.   subroutine,
function, block data ...



3.2.2  [.TOOLS] -

Development tools.



3.3  [.EXE]

Contains all the executable  images  for  monoliths  as  well  as  the
compiled    interface    files.     Also    contains   the   following
sub-directories:



3.3.1  [.TASKS] -

Contains executable code for individual Atasks.



3.3.2  [.PROCS] -

Contains ICL procedures.



3.4  [.HELP]

Contains the help libraries for ASTHELP.



3.5  [.LIB]

Contains the source and object code for the main library ASTLIB



3.6  [.SOURCE]

Contains all source and object files not in ASTLIB.  It is split  into
several  subdirectories, one for each monolith.  Each of these contain
a text library of Fortran source code, an object library, an IFL  file
for the monolith and command files to link individual applications and
the whole monolith.

3.7  [.SYSTEM]

Command files to define logicals and symbols (see 4).
     STARTUP.COM     -    Starts the ASTERIX system
     LOGNAM.COM      -    Defines logicals for users
     DATLOGNAM.COM   -    Defines logicals for data files
     COMMANDS.COM    -    Sets up ASTERIX commands as DCL symbols
     DEVLOGNAM.COM   -    Defines logicals and symbols for ASTERIX
                          development




4  DCL LOGICAL AND SYMBOL NOMENCLATURE

All ASTERIX logicals are prefixed by "AST_".  The logical pointing  to
a  particular  directory is of the form 'AST_(directory abbreviation)'
e.g.  the directory  [ASTERIX.EXE]  is  pointed  to  by  AST_EXE,  the
directory  [ASTERIX.SOURCE.EXOSAT]  has  the logical AST_EXO.  Some of
these logicals are set up when ASTERIX is entered, and more are  added
by  ASTDEV.   For  a  list  of  those currently defined, type "SHO LOG
AST_*".
