The rules below govern the contents of the ASTERIX .raw documentation
source. These files contain raw text which is processed by the tool
'hlpconv' into 3 different forms.

 1) HLP source. The input source to the Starlink help system
 
 2) HTML files. Files name for the WWW online version of the ASTERIX gelp
    system

 3) LaTex documentation.





0) Indentation in .raw files. All text should be indented by one space. TABS
   should never be used. The only non-blank characters in the first column
   should be the level numbers.

1) Examples

   Prompts should reflect when a command can be run

   csh>	shell only
   ICL>  ICL only
      >  both

2) Carriage returns are no longer significant. HLPCONV works out how much
   text fits on a line depending on the indentation level in the HLP case.
   Neither LaTeX nor Mosaic care about line breaks.

3) The formatting HTML tags supported in .raw. Not all are directly supported
   by HTML browsers - these are <exam> and <key>. These are are translated by
   hlpconv 

   Tag                      HLP             TEX                   HTML
     (usage)

   <exam> txt </exam>       txt, indented   txt is verbatim,      <bq><pre>...
                            2 chars         and indented          </pre></bq>
     example text

   <pre> txt </pre>         txt             txt is verbatim,      -
                                            not indented          
     preformatted text

   <key> txt </key>         <txt>           \verb+<txt>+          &lt txt &gt
     key name, eg. <RETURN>

   <cite> txt </cite>       txt             {\em txt}             -

   <em> txt </em>           bold txt        {\em txt}             -
 
   <code> txt </code>       'txt'           {\tt txt}             - 
     computer text, eg. command names

   <var> txt </var>	    <txt>           {\em txt}             -
     meta-variables
 
   <math> txt </math>       NONE            $ txt $               NONE
     math formulae

   <ul> <li>.. </ul>        formatted       itemize environment   -
     unordered list

   <ol> <li>.. </ol>        formatted       enumerate environment -
     ordered list

   <dl> <dt><dd>.. </dl>    formatted       description environ't -
     descriptive list
   
   NB : NONE means tags are stripped out and enclosed text is present in output
        <bq> means <blockquote>
         -   means no change from .raw to product file

3) Special symbols. The special symbols start with an ampersand and (mostly)
   trap special TEX, special HTML, or non-ascii characters.

   Code     Description    HLP          HTML             TEX

   &amp     ampersand      &            &amp             \&
   &gt      greater than   >            &gt              $>$
   &lt      less than      <            &lt              $<$
   &inf     infinity       infinity     infinity         $\infty$
   &lar     left arrow     <-           &lt-             $\leftarrow$
   &rar     right arrow    ->           -&gt             $\rightarrow$
   &sim     approx eq to   ~            ~                $\sim$
   &quot    quote          '            &quot            '

4) Topic names should never contain a slash. This is because topic names
   map directly on to filenames in the WWW page. The server must be able
   to distiguish between topic name text and directories.
