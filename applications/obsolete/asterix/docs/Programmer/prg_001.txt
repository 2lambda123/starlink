               Brief guide to use of the UFIT_ routines
              ******************************************

The UFIT_ routines in this directory are intended for incorporation into
a user's program to perform a chi-squared fitting task. They have been 
stripped out from the FIT_ package to make them more self-contained and easy 
to use.

The control for the minimisation is contained in UFIT_MIN and this calls
only two futher routines: UFIT_CHISQ and UFIT_DERIVS, the latter simply calls
UFIT_CHISQ several times to establish chi-squared gradients. The user need
only provide the routine UFIT_CHISQ which, given the model parameters in an
array, returns the chi-squared fit to the data. All other information required
to do this can be passed into UFIT_CHISQ via common blocks. 

Hence to use this package you must do the following:-

1. Write a routine UFIT_CHISQ to replace the dummy version in the UFIT 
directory. This has a simple interface
		UFIT_CHISQ(PARAM,CHISQ,STATUS)
where	PARAM is an imported array of (REAL) model parameter values
	CHISQ (REAL) returns the chisquared value
	STATUS (INTEGER) is a status value, returned as zero if all is well
All additional information required by UFIT_CHISQ must be passed to it from 
the top level program via common blocks.

2. Write a calling program which sets up the arrays and variables necessary 
for UFIT_MIN, and puts all the information which UFIT_CHISQ will require 
into COMMON. This program calls UFIT_MIN to perform the fitting. The 
interface is
		UFIT_CHIMIN(OPCHAN,NITMAX,NPAR,LB,UB,FROZEN,NDOF,
		            INITIALISE,MINSLO,PARAM,DPAR,PEGGED,CHISQ,NIT,
		            FINISHED,FITERR,STATUS)

The arguments are described in the program header. Provided INITIALISE is set 
TRUE on entry, DPAR, NIT, FINISHED and FITERR will be set up by the routine.
The other arguments might be set as follows:-

OPCHAN	Set to 6 for terminal output reporting progress (0 for no output).
NITMAX	Maximum no. of iterations before return. 30 is sensible.
NPAR	Number of model parameters.
LB,UB	Lower and upper bounds for each parameter. These will not be crossed
	in the fitting process. The parameter step for gradient calculation is
	set to (UB-LB)/2000.
FROZEN	Array of logicals enabling parameter freezing. Set FALSE to free all
	parameters.
NDOF	Number of degrees of freedom for chi-squared (used to calculate 
	reduced chi-squared) = no. of data minus no. of unfrozen parameters.
MINSLO	Termination slope criterion. Defaults to 20. if entered as zero. 
	Smaller values will make it more choosy about terminating.
PARAM	On entry this should contain the start values for the parameters. 
	Choice of sensible start values can be very important, the routine 
	will settle for the first local minimum it finds. 
	On successful return PARAM will contain the best fit parameter values.

The following are returned in addition to PARAM:-

PEGGED	A logical array flagging those parameters whose values is set on one
	of its bounds. Where one of these is TRUE the minimum found is a
	constrained minimum.
CHISQ	The minimum chi-squared value attained.
NIT	The number of iterations performed before termination.
FINISHED Whether a satisfactory termination was achieved (as opposed to 
	 termination because NITMAX iterations have been executed).
FITERR	A non-zero value indicates a fitting error (see the header of
	UFIT_MIN for explanation of the various codes). This should 
	therefore be checked on return.
STATUS	A non-zero value indicates an HDS error, which is very unlikely here.

3. Compile calling program and user-supplied UFIT_CHISQ and link using
	$ ALINK CALLING_PROG,UFIT_CHISQ,ASTOPT/OPT
