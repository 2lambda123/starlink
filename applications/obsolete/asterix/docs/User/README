CREATING USER_005 - brief notes.

09 Mar 00

  See pg 43 Sun/145.6 UNIX - AN Introduction.

  The  document user_005   and  associated  files  is  presently  in   -
/soft/asterix/asterix/docs/user.

  These documents are accessible  from the web  DO NOT WORK ON THEM LIVE
make a copy.

  Once changes are complete  move the currently versions to user_005_old
and then copy over.

  Four file types are create .html .ps. .pdf .dvi.

  Although in  the AST_TOP/docs directory they  are "linked" directly to
the web pages - in /www/web/asterix/user

  Creating USER5 involves a number of steps.

1) TEX.  User5 is written (in a   text editor) in  the LATEX  FORMAT -
ending with file extension .tex

2) LATEX turns .TEX files to .DVI (DEVICE INDEPENDENT) files

   For example eg. -> LATEX user_005.tex

   XDVI can be used to display .DVI files

3) DVIPS CONVERTS TO .DVI to .PS (POSTSCRIPT) eg ->dvips user_005.dvi
 
   GV (GHOSTVIEWER) can be used to view .PS files

4) PDF  (ADOBE ACROBAT PORTABLE  DOCUMENT FORM)  files can  be created
from PS files using ACROBAT DISTILLER.

   We presently only have one  ACROBAT license -  for PC32. The reader
   is widely available. To display use ACROREAD .
  
   The conversion is simple. The file created was readable in UNIX but
   NOT on the NT machine.

   To  print PDF save  as   PS in acroread   ~ check  A4 size OR   see
   /base2/bwf/bin/ - one of the scripts in here

5) LATEX files can be converted to HTML using LATEX2HTML

  eg.  latex2html user_005.tex.

  This sets  up  a directory structure containing   a number of  .html
  files.

     *

  The link to "user" on the asterix webpage contains  links to each of
  these   document types  -   html,  ps, dvi,   pdf.   If   the helper
  application   is  specified under  preferences  in  the browser then
  clicking on these links will  initiate the application otherwise the
  user is prompted to download the corresponding file.

  The user_005 .pdf .ps and .pdf file are renamed rosat-user-guide and
  copied to /soft/asterix/asterix/docs
