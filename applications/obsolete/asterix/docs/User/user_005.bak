\section{Introduction}
This guide is for people who want to reduce and analyse data from the ROSAT
X-ray satellite using the Starlink multi-mission data analysis package
ASTERIX. It describes how to get from observation datasets to high
level data products such as spectra, point source lists, etc.

\subsection{Software version}
This version of the user guide is associated with ASTERIX version 2.2,
which was released in the spring of 1999.  This release of ASTERIX
is supported solely on Solaris, Digital Unix, and Linux.

\subsection{Getting started}
All commands described in this document are available automatically as part 
of ASTERIX. If you have ASTERIX installed at your site, it can be started
by typing

\begin{verbatim}
       > aststart
\end{verbatim}

Most ASTERIX commands can be run from the shell.  The exception to this is
the command driven version of image processing.  This requires the
user to start ICL (command: {\tt icl}), although most of the same
functions are available within Isys, the image processing GUI, which
is invoked from the shell.  All other ASTERIX commands will also run
from ICL.

\subsection{Getting help}
This document provides recipes for specific data analysis tasks, as well
as descriptions of the data formats. It does not provide detailed help on
individual ASTERIX ROSAT commands. 

Such help is provided by the on-line help system, invoked by the command

\begin{verbatim}
       > asthelp
\end{verbatim}

{\tt asthelp} attempts to provide complete information on all ASTERIX commands,
as well as more general guidance on how to get started with ASTERIX,
where to find documentation, information specific to the current ASTERIX
release, etc. 

With this release of ASTERIX, a hypertext version of {\tt asthelp} is also
available. This can be invoked with the command 

\begin{verbatim}
       > xasthelp
\end{verbatim}

Or referenced on the WWW at 

\begin{verbatim}
        http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/asterix-docs/Asthelp/base
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Related documents}
ROSAT is now a mature project, and there is a very large number of
documents available. 


The international ROSAT project has also produced a number of useful
documents, including individual calibration memos and the ROSAT Users
Handbook. These are available from the US anonymous ftp site {\it
legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov}.  More specific references are provided in later
section where appropriate.

News items, including the national ROSAT newsletters can be accessed
via the Leicester ROSAT home page and the HEASARC ROSAT guest observer
facility on the World Wide Web.  Information about ASTERIX is
available on Birmingham University's ASTERIX home page.

\subsection{Layout of this guide}
The following sections give information about the ROSAT satellite (section 2),
the data that you get from ROSAT (section 3), how to read a data tape and
how to get a quick idea of what your data contains (section 4), detailed
descriptions of how to analyse ROSAT PSPC and HRI data (section 5), how to
communicate with the ROSAT project and how to stay informed (section 6).
Finally, there is a number of appendices describing the dataset formats,
giving a full list of ASTERIX XRT commands.

\newpage
\section{ROSAT}
The ROSAT X-ray astronomy satellite (R\"ontgen Satellite) was launched on
June 1, 1990, and is now operated from Germany. ROSAT is a German satellite,
which also has scientific intrumentation supplied by the USA and the UK.
There are scientific data centres at the Max Planck Institut f\"ur
Extraterrestische Astrophysik (MPE) near Munich in Germany, the Goddard Space
Flight Center (GSFC) near Washington DC in the US, and RAL/University of
Leicester in the UK. 

\subsection{Project}
Following a performance verification and calibration phase, the ROSAT
satellite spent 6 months continuously scanning the sky to make an all-sky
survey. This ended on Jan 25 1991, since then observations have consisted
of pointings at individual targets. These targets are selected by
peer-review commitees from proposals made in response to annual announcements
of opportunity in the three countries.

\subsection{Satellite}
The ROSAT satellite is in a 96 minute period, low earth orbit having an
inclination of 53$^o$. It is a 3-axis stabilised spacecraft with two
co-aligned telescope systems. The main telescope is the X-Ray Telescope
(XRT), having at its focus a carousel which can place one of two Position
Sensitive Proportional Counters (PSPC) or a microchannel plate High
Resolution Imager (HRI) in the beam. There is also a Wide Field Camera
(WFC) for EUV astronomy co-mounted with the XRT. This document deals
only with the analysis of data from the XRT. SUN 62 describes the analysis
of data from the WFC.

\subsection{Attitude Measurement and Control System}
The ROSAT XRT has two CCD star trackers (one of which failed early in the
mission). The WFC has an independent star tracker. The data from this
star tracker are being incorporated into XRT attitude solutions in the Rev
2 data reprocessing.

During PSPC observations the ROSAT spacecraft is wobbled with an
amplitude of typically $\pm$ 3 arcminutes at a period of around 400
seconds. This avoids having the sharply focussed X-ray image of a point
source hitting a detector wire throughout the observation. HRI images are
also wobbled, but with a lower amplitude of typically $\pm$ 1.5 arcminutes.
Although the wobble is strictly periodic, the path of an image across the
detector varies from cycle to cycle.

Attitude reconstruction has not met specification. This can manifest
itself in distortion of the on-axis PSF seen with the HRI, and as offsets
of up to 30 arcseconds between the positions of objects observed after an
interval of months. 

\subsection{XRT Mirrors}
The ROSAT XRT consists of four nested co-focal Wolter type 1 gold-coated
Zerodur (glass) grazing incidence mirrors manufactured by Zeiss in
Germany. The system has a field of view larger than the 2$^o$ diameter of
the PSPC (the HRI is smaller), although vignetting is significant at large
off-axis angles, especially at high energies. The mirror system has a focal
length of 240cm, a focal plane scale of 11.64 $\mu$ per arcsecond, and a
geometric area of 1141 cm$^2$. The point spread function and effective area
is described in the sections on the PSPC and HRI detectors.

\subsection{PSPC}
There are two (nominally identical) position sensitive proportional
counters on ROSAT. PSPC C was in use up to Jan 25, 1991, after which PSPC
B only was used.

The PSPC is a multiwire proportional counter which provides both spectral
and spatial resolution. The counter gas is argon/methane/xenon, enclosed
by a 1 $\mu$ polypropylene/carbon/lexan window supported by a 
grid  with 72\% transmission. A window support structure consists of 8 
radial ribs meeting at a 20 arcminute diameter ring. The PSPC has a 2$^o$
diameter. It has effective area between 0.1 and 2.2 keV, peaking at 330
cm$^2$ just below the carbon edge at 0.28 keV.

In general, both spectral and spatial resolution improve with increasing
energy, but although the PSPC has 256 pha channels, it can make only
$\sim$ 5 independent spectral measures. The spectral resolution varies as
$$ FWHM/E = 0.43 (E/0.93)^{-0.5}$$

The PSPC detector used for observations was swapped (from detector `C' to
detector `B') on 25th January 1991, and the detector gain changed on
11th October 1991, so different combinations of response matrix and
effective area file must be used for observations taken between these dates.

The recommended combinations are: 

before 25th January 1991 - pspcc\_eff.sdf and drm\_06.sdf \\
25th January 1991 to 11th October 1991 - pspcb\_eff.sdf and drm\_06.sdf \\
after 11th October 1991 - pspcb\_eff.sdf and drm\_36.sdf \\

For further information on using these files, see the Leicester Database
and Archive Services (LEDAS) User Guide or the ASTERIX documentation. 

\begin{verbatim}
        http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/ledas/user_guide/user_guide.html 
\end{verbatim}


The PSPC PSF encloses 50\% of counts at 1 keV in a radius of 0.22
arcminutes. A model describing the the PSF as a function of energy and
off-axis angle (within the 20 arcminute ring) is a good fit to the data.
However, at large off-axis angles the PSF can no longer be treated as
circularly symmetric, and at the lowest energies electronic 'ghosting'
occurs, significantly broadening the PSF below 0.19 keV. Neither of these
extreme cases is covered by the PSF model.

The PSPC was occasionally used with a boron filter in the X-ray beam.
This filter has little transmission between the boron edge (0.188 keV)
and the carbon edge (0.28 keV), and thus can provide extra spectral
information in the energy range where the intrinsic spectral resolution
is poorest. The boron filter only covered the central part of the PSPC
field of view.

Since the end of 1994, the gas supply to the PSPC has been exhausted.
The HRI is now permanantly at the focus.  A typical PSPC image can be seen
in Figure 1.
  
\subsection{HRI}
The ROSAT HRI is an enhanced version of the HRI flown on the Einstein
satellite. It consists of two cascaded microchannel plates with a crossed
grid readout system. The quantum efficiency of the HRI is maximised by
use of a CsI coating on the front plate.
 
The HRI field of view is the intersection of a circle and a square,
having an effective radius of $\sim$ 18 arcminutes. Unlike the PSPC, it
is able to make full use of the very small mirror PSF, and has an on-axis 
50\% power radius of 3 arcseconds. However, point images also show a large
diameter, low surface brightness halo

The effective area of the HRI is less than that of the PSPC at all
energies, particularly so at the lowest energies. Like the PSPC, it has a
strong carbon edge at 0.28 keV.

The HRI has 16 pha channels, and is easily able to distinguish UV photons from
X-rays. Some X-ray spectral resolution may also be possible, however
this would be very limited. Spatial gain variations 
have not been corrected in the HRI datasets.  A typical HRI image can be
seen in Figure 2.

\newpage
\section{The ROSAT Data}

\subsection{Overview and Origins}
Data from the ROSAT XRT is processed by the SASS (Scientific Analysis
Software System) before being converted to a FITS format and then
distributed to the PI. This processing occurs at MPE for data belonging
to German and UK PIs, and at GSFC for US PIs. Both the SASS and the FITS
conversion software have evolved throughout the mission, but more
fundementally, the FITS conversion up until May 1994 was different at MPE
from that at GSFC. (This corresponds to SASS versions earlier than 7\_1.) 
Data distributed after that date was FITS converted
using yet another form of the FITS standard, `Rationalized Data Format'
(RDF). This FITS conversion is now common between MPE and GSFC.

Starting at around the same time as the FITS software change, a 
re-processing of all data using the evolved SASS was started. This has
become known as the `Rev 2 re-processing'. The ouput from this
re-processing are RDF files. Data in the Leicester public archives currently
consist of a mix of RDF and pre-RDF FITS files. However, after the 6-month
PI exclusive use interval for this re-processed data has elapsed, the RDF
version of the data will be placed in the public archive, and the old
FITS format data will be removed.  

ASTERIX does not read any of the FITS files directly, they must be converted
to HDS files by the program {\tt xrtconv} before other utilities are used.
{\tt xrtconv} will automatically deal with all possible ROSAT FITS formats.

\subsection{The SASS}
The Standard Analysis Software System converts the ROSAT telemetry into
scientifically useful files. It performs standard scientific operations on
these files, and generates postscript output summarising the observation.
The data in the files that make up a ROSAT XRT observation dataset have all
been through the SASS, however, the SASS does not make the FITS files that PIs
and archive users receive, this is done by later software.

The SASS was written by MPE and SAO. Identical copies run at MPE and
GSFC, although it has been continuously updated throughout the mission.  
A brief description of the SASS follows, however, the details of what
specific versions of the SASS have done have proved difficult to uncover.
What is clear is that later versions of the SASS produce significantly more
reliable results than earlier versions. Confidence has risen to the point
that with SASS version 7\_1 the entire set of observations to date are being
re-processed (the so-called `Rev 2 re-processing').

The following modules make up the SASS.

SAV -- copies telemetry tape to disk, deleting duplicate records, and
separates PSPC from HRI data.

TEL -- splits data into continuous observing intervals and identifies
these with the timeline, assigns quality flags to detector and aspect data.

OBI -- applies the aspect solution and screens out bad data. Determines
components of background map.

SEQ (PSPC) -- merges observation, makes images, performs source detection
and indentification, makes spectra and light curves and applies
statistical tests to these.

SEQ (HRI) -- as above, but no spectra or scientific lightcurves made.

\subsection{FITS Conversions}
The ROSAT datasets have always been distributed as collections of FITS
files, however there have been three different sets of file formats
within the  FITS convention. The MPE and GSFC FITS files represent the first
generation data format. They were developed independently, and were read by
the respective national analysis packages.  Datasets from the two sites
contained essentially the same information, although the GSFC datasets
included files that had no equivalent in the MPE datasets. UK and German
PIs had data in the MPE format, US PIs had data in the GSFC format.

The fact that there were two data formats, together with the
defficiencies of the individual FITS styles, led to the definition of the
a format common to both MPE and GSFC. This is the `Rationalised Data
Format' (RDF), which is decribed below. The switch between first
generation FITS files and RDF FITS files took place in April 1994. In
addition to current PI data, all prior data is being re-processed by the
SASS and converted to RDF files.   

Detailed descriptions of the files making up the datasets in the three
formats are given for both the PSPC and HRI in appendix 1. This appendix
also shows the correspondence between FITS files and HDS files. 

\newpage
\section{Getting a quick look at your data}
In this section you will find a description of how to get from the your
data tape or archive dataset useful images, spectra and lightcurves of
point sources.

\subsection{How to get your data onto disk}

\subsubsection{Reading a data tape}
The UK ROSAT Data Centre sends out data tapes to PIs. Until May 1994,
these tapes were always in VMS backup format. After that date, the
default format became unix tar.

You can read the unix data tapes to disk with the command

\begin{verbatim}
       > tar -xvf /dev/rmt0l
\end{verbatim} 

where /dev/rmt0l is the device filename for the tape drive.  Extracted
files will be placed in the current directory.

\subsubsection{Accessing the on-line public archive}
ROSAT data enters the public archive 1 year and 2 weeks after it was first sent
to the PI. Rev 2 data enters the archive 6 months after distribution.

UK investigators can easily get archive datasets from the on-line service
maintained by the Leicester Database and Archive Service (LEDAS). Access
is described in detail in The LEDAS User Guide but will be describe very
briefly here.

\begin{verbatim}
        http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/ledas/user_guide/user_guide.html
\end{verbatim}

The archive service is currently run from a DEC Alpha and is accessible via
telnet and the WWW.

Connect to the LEDAS machine:

\begin{verbatim}
        > telnet ledas.star.le.ac.uk
\end{verbatim}

Use the username {\tt xray}, no password is required. After giving your
name, you will see a prompt. Type

\begin{verbatim}
        ledas>  browse rospublic
\end{verbatim}

You will then be using the Browse Database Management System, which has
been described in a Users Guide (ESA TM-11, distributed to all Starlink
sites as a MUD). The system is not described here, however, if you know
the position or name of your target, or the original PI name, you can
issue one of the following commands: 

\begin{verbatim}
        rospublic_total_dec> sc 10 20 30 +20 30 40
        rospublic_total_dec> sn crab
        rospublic_total_dec> sif pi smith
\end{verbatim}

These perform searches, the results from which can be seen with the
display sample command {\tt ds}. Once the dataset required is identified,
the command {\tt request} will cause the dataset to be read from the CD
jukebox to a staging area from which you can copy the data over the net
to your home site. The system will mail you when the data is ready for
copying, usually within 5 minutes of the {\tt request} command being
issued.

An alternative method using the WWW at Leicester and the {\it ARNIE}
interface can be found at:

\begin{verbatim}
        http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/arnieV3
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{A Quick Look at the Data}
With your data on a local disk  you are now ready to run ASTERIX on it.
Start ASTERIX with the command:

\begin{verbatim}
        > aststart
\end{verbatim}

ASTERIX cannot read ROSAT data in its original FITS form, so the data must
be converted to HDS. Data sent to the PI from MPE and GSFC or taken from
the RDAC can be converted using this command:

\begin{verbatim}
        > xrtconv
\end{verbatim}

Datafiles from the HEASARC may need to be renamed to follow the original
filename conventions. It is recommended that the RDAC database datasets be
used in preference.

Following {\tt xrtconv} you can get a summary of the observation with the command {\tt showxrt}.

ROSAT data is in the form of event tables, that is a logical record
containing detection attributes such as position, time, etc. Most
analysis cannot make use of the data in this form, but requires uniformly
binned data. The ASTERIX command to bin data is {\tt xrtsort}. With this
you can make images, spectra, light curves, etc. It's probably
best to make an image first. From this you  can select regions for
further study using {\tt Isys}.

{\it Note:} that the older sorting application {\tt xsort} will be
included for one release for people with their own, pre-existing
scripts.)

{\tt Isys} or the command driven image processing can be used to
inspect the imager.  Specific regions can then be resorted either by
entering simple parameters into {\tt xrtsort}, such as positions and
redii of circles or annuli, or a regional description can be exported
from {\tt Isys} in ARD format then entered into xrtsort.  Subsequently
the background can be extracted with {\tt xrtsub}, calibrations and
corrections applied with {\tt xtrcorr}, and an energy response applied
with {\tt xrtresp}.  ASTERIX spectral fitting can then be used
directly, if you have it installed, or the command {\tt ast2xsp} can
be used to format the data to a form suitable for {\tt xspec}.

More detailed guidance on data analysis techniques appears in subsequent
sections of this guide.

\section{Detailed Analysis}

\subsection{PSPC}

The following is a brief overview of the basic reduction sequence, the
details are shown in the later subsections.

{\bf ROSAT} data may be obtained from a datatape or from the Leicester
data archive (LEDAS).  In either case the raw data should be copied
into a single directory.  It is important that this directory does not
contain any raw datafiles from another observation as this can cause
problems with the pre-processing.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Run {\tt xrtconv} on the raw dataset to convert into ASTERIX format.}
\item{{\tt showxrt} will produce a summary of the observation, listing
information such as target name, pointing direction and exposure time.}
\item{The program {\tt xrthk} may be used to "clean" the data by
producing a file of times when the background was low.}
\item{{\tt xrtsort} can now be used to sort the data directly into an
ASTERIX data file.  Example 1 shows {\tt xrtsort} being used to create an
image.  If a file of time slots has been created with {\tt xrthk} this
can be used in {\tt xrtsort} when sorting the data (see Example 2).}
\item{The data can be background subtracted with the program {\tt
xrtsub}.  A background file should first be sorted from a blank area
of sky with {\tt xrtsort}.}
\item{{\tt xrtcorr} is used to exposure correct a dataset.  This
includes corrections for instrumental effects, such as vignetting,
dead time as well as normalisation to on-axis counts/sec.}
\item{A detector matrix needs to be produced with {\tt xrtresp} before
spectral fitting can be performed.  To use {\tt xspec} convert the
files using {\tt ast2xsp}.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Background subtraction}
This is a complex problem and needs to be thought about carefully before
proceeding. The PSPC background consists of a cosmic X-ray background,
a particle induced detector background, solar scattered X-rays,
afterpulses, long and short term enhancements and auroral X-rays. 
A full description is given in Snowden et al, 1993.

The particles contribute $\sim2-3\%$ of the background on average 
($\sim 5\%$ for an observation with the boron filter), with their major
effect being above 1 keV. The needs of background subtraction are as
follows:

{\bf 1.} A representative region of background has to be selected 
from the observation using the {\tt Isys} GUI or the command driven image
processing commands.
The background region should satisfy the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
       \item{Large enough to give good statistics}
       \item{Free from sources}
       \item{Should not include the ribs or central ring}
       \item{As near to source as possible, to avoid ramps in the background}
\end{itemize}

{\bf 2.} The background data need to be corrected for vignetting effects
before subtraction. This is energy dependent and is complicated by the fact
that the particles in the background have a different radial dependency 
to the photons (i.e. they are not vignetted).

{\bf 3.} The background has to be normalised for the area of the source
and background boxes before subtraction.

{\tt xrtsub} calculates: 
\begin{math}
SUB = SRC - BCK \times \frac {A_{s}} {A_{b}} \left[
B_{phot} \frac {V_{s}} {V_{b}} + B_{part} \frac {P_{s}} {P_{b}} \right]
\end{math}

where A is the area, $B_{phot}$ the photon fraction of the background, 
$B_{part}$ the particle fraction, V is the vignetting function and P is the
position dependence of the particles. The subscripts 's' and 'b' refer to
source and background respectively.


The program {\tt xrtsub} caters for points 2 and 3, so the user only has to
worry about point 1. The program ignores source or background pixels with
bad quality and this feature may be used to create background regions with
complicated shapes, which satisfy the requirements of point 1. e.g. an
annulus at a large radius with sources and the ribs removed. See the 
section on subtracting extended sources for a recipe for creating such a
background file.

The particles in the background are calculated using a model developed in
Snowden et al. 1992 and updated by Plucinsky et al. 1993, which 
gives the particle flux as a function of energy,
time and detector position. Over a single observation this model is 
entirely dependent on the
housekeeping parameter master\_veto\_rate, which is contained in an array
in the eventrate file. The model is well constrained for values between
0 and 170, and this constraint should be applied to the data using
{\tt xrthk} before attempting a difficult subtraction. The model parameters
vary on a timescales of months. This effect is taken into account by providing
a different set of model parameters depending on the date of the 
observation. 

\subsubsection{Point source subtraction}
The background subtraction of point sources tends to be relatively easy
because of the low intrinsic background of the PSPC.  Use {\tt Isys}
to determine a suitable background area and then sort with {\tt xrtsort}.
This should be either an annulus around the source, with an inner radius of
at least 3 arcminutes, or if source confusion makes this impossible, a
circular box as near as possible to the source. The background box should
be as large as possible without including any sources or intersecting the
window support structure.  If a spectrum or time series is being
subtracted, the background datafile must have exactly the same range of
spectral bins and time bins as the source file.

\subsubsection{Extended source subtraction}
This is a much trickier problem. The {\tt asthelp} section 
"{\tt xrtsub} advice extended\_sources" gives up to date advice on the best 
subtraction method. The subtraction of an image provides a good illustration 
of the current best technique. Let's say a background subtracted image of 
the whole field between corrected pulse height channels 11 and 250 is
required. First, {\tt xrtsort} should be used to make a {\em spectral\_image}
over this channel range with about 6 spectral bins. A few spectral bins
need to be used to adequately sample the vignetting function which is energy
dependent.
(It is unnecessary to use more than about 10 spectral bins because of the
moderate energy resolution of the instrument. Indeed using a large number
of energy bins can cause problems due to irregularities in the vignetting
function). 

The background area needs to be large but constrained within a narrow range of 
off-axis angles (so that a single vignetting correction may be applied to
the data). The best shape to satisfy these criteria is an annulus at a
reasonably large off-axis angle (e.g. $r=0.6^o - 0.7^o$). To produce such
an annulus with sources and window support structure removed, use the
following procedure:

\begin{itemize}
       \item{Mask support structures using {\tt xspokes} and {\tt ardqual}.}
       \item{Select your background region using {\tt iregion annulus}.}
       \item{Export the remaining areas using {\tt iregion invert} and
{\tt iregion export}.}
       \item{Mask the un-selected regions using {\tt ardqual}.}
\end{itemize}

{\tt xrtsub} may then be run on the source and background spectral images.
The output spectral image can be compressed into an image using
{\tt project}. Alternatively it may be {\tt project}ed into a spectrum for spectral work.
{\em NB:} DO NOT compress the background spectral image into a
spectrum before background subtraction as this will result in the 
spatial information being lost and the program will be unable to normalise for 
the box areas.

The above procedure is fairly robust against spatial variations in the
background.  One problem is that beyond the central ring, it becomes harder
to resolve point sources from the background. This means that faint
sources may be included in the background region when they would have been
ignored in the middle. This can cause a slight over-subtraction and be a
problem for very accurate work. No data should be used beyond a radius of
50 arcminutes due to inaccuracies in the vignetting function at these large
radii. 

\subsubsection{Multiple point sources}
The situation where there are a large number of point sources within the 
central ring, such as a 'deep survey' field, has many similarities to the
case of the extended source. Choosing a nearby background region for each 
source is often impossible because of source confusion and anyway
is time consuming. One method of subtracting these sources is to use an
annulus at a large radius as described above. However, this method may
cause over-subtraction and since many of the sources are likely to be
faint, this can be a serious problem.

An alternative method is to use background from within the central ring.
Although much of the area may be contaminated by sources, there is usually
a reasonable amount of blank sky available. The method for producing such
a background file is very similar to the annular background described in the
'Extended source' section. 

\begin{itemize}
   \item{Produce a square spectral\_image with sides just larger than
the circle required$^{\star}$} 
   \item{Select the regions to be excluded using {\tt iregion}.}
   \item{Export the regions into an ARDFILE using {\tt iregion export}.}
   \item{Use {\tt ardqual} to remove the sources.}
\end{itemize}

$^{\star}$ Never {\tt xrtsort} directly to a circular or annular
spectral\_image.  The pixels at the edge of the circle will be only half
filled and there is no way of subsequently correcting for this in the software.

An example of this method is shown in Figure 3.

A restriction of this method is that a single vignetting correction has
to be applied to the whole background file. This means that the range of 
off-axis angles that can be used with this method is limited. A circular 
background region with off-axis angles 0--12 arcminutes or an annular box with 
angles 10--17 are acceptable. 

When removing   sources from the   background region, careful consideration
must be given to the point spread function of the instrument. Very high and
very  low energies are the  most affected  by photon  scattering  and so if
sources  are  inadequately  removed the   spectral  characteristics  of the
background will be strongly biased. A description  of the PSPC PSF is given
in Hasinger et al.  1992. Faint sources ($<  100$ counts) can be adequately
excluded with a circle  of 1--2 arcminutes radius, centered  on the source. 
Brighter sources should be treated individually. {\tt  Isys} can be used to
obtain a radial profile to ascertain the distance from  the source at which
the source counts  fall below the  level of the background.  Photons should
be excluded from a circle of this radius  centred on the source.  Its often
a good idea to smooth the image, before extracting the profile.

\subsection{Instrument Corrections}
\subsubsection{Spatial/Temporal Gain Correction}
The PSPC suffers from both spatial and temporal gain variations.  An
account of this can be found in {\it OGIP Calibration Memo CAL/ROS/95-003}.
ASTERIX doesn't currently take these into account, however, there is an
ftool, {\it pcpicor} which can be applied to the raw FITS data before {\tt
  xrtconv} is run. This will only work for data in RDF format.
\subsubsection{Exposure Correction} 
The program {\tt xrtcorr} performs exposure correction on binned datasets. The 
effects listed in the following table are corrected for:

\begin {table}
\caption{Correction factor dependencies}
\label{t:corr}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
  Correction    &  Energy   & Time  &  Position \\ \hline
Vignetting      &   YES     &  NO   &    YES    \\
PSF scattering  &   YES     &  NO   &    YES    \\
Filter absorption &   YES     &  NO   &    NO   \\
Dead time       &   NO      &  YES  &    NO     \\
Wires           &   NO      &  NO   &    NO    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{table}

All these effects are applied directly to the {\em data} when exposure
correcting a time series or an image, however, only the dead time correction
is applied to a spectrum; in this case the energy dependent corrections 
and the effect of the wires are applied to the detector matrix. 
For a time series or an image, the energy dependent 
corrections, vignetting,
PSF scattering and filter absorption, are applied assuming a mean energy.
The default energy for this correction is 0.2 keV but it may be overridden
on the command line, by :

\begin{verbatim}
        > xrtcorr energy=1.0
\end{verbatim}

The vignetting and filter corrections are read from the effective
area and detector matrix files held in the \$XRTCAL directory. The PSF
correction is calculated from an analytical function and is a strong
function of off-axis angle as well as energy. The wire correction is a
single value (1.27) and dead time is calculated from count rate values
stored in the eventrate file and is usually $\sim 2\%$.

The vignetting, PSF and filter corrections are {\em ENERGY} dependent
and {\em NOT} pulse height dependent. This means that they cannot be
directly applied to the data in a {\em spectrum} but rather must be applied
to the detector matrix used in spectral fitting.
The data in a spectrum are simply multiplied by the dead time factor
and divided by the exposure time during exposure correction. The wire
factor is not applied because this is also contained within the detector 
matrix.

Images and spectral\_images are corrected for dead time and vignetting.
The vignetting correction applied to an image assumes a mean energy
and so is not accurate. The correction applied to a spectral\_image,
uses the approximate energy to pulse height bin mapping of 
$E=(Ch.No.) / 100$ keV. This again is not accurate and under no circumstances
should a spectral image be corrected with {\tt xrtcorr} and then used for
{\em spectral} work by {\tt project}ing the file into a spectrum.

\subsection{Spectral analysis}
PSPC spectra may be produced over the channel range 1-256.  However the first
7 channels should be ignored in the spectral analysis of sources observed
before 11th October 1991. On this date, the operating voltage of the
detector was reduced in an attempt to lower the detector background. This
led to the first 10 channels becoming useless and so analysis of
observations post 11th October 1991 should ignore the first 10 channels. 

\subsubsection{Single point source}
This is the simplest case, a circular box should be used in {\tt xrtsort} to
extract the source counts into a spectrum (BIN\_AXIS=7). There is one 
subtlety which must be 
considered. The PSF of the PSPC is very energy dependent (Hasinger et al 1992),
e,g, on-axis the 95\% radius of a point source is 0.65 arcminutes at 
0.5 keV, but 8.8 arcminutes at 1.7 keV. Below $\sim 0.3 keV$ (channel 30),
PSPC images suffer from an effect known as 'electronic ghost imaging'.
This causes events to be recorded at the intersection of anode wires rather
than at their true position and results in the image appearing like a
rectangular grid rather than a point source. This effect varies
from source to source and so is impossible to correct for in the software.
It has been found that a source radius of 3 arcminutes usually includes
most of the counts at all energies and produces good results as a rule.
If low energies are not important and/or the source is very faint, this
can be reduced to $\sim 1$ arcminute to improve the signal to noise.
If very low energy counts are important for a particular source, e.g.
if it is a very soft source, then the radius which includes most of the soft
counts needs to be found. This may be done by displaying the {\em low energy}
image with {\tt idisplay}, centroiding on the source and producing a radial
profile with {\tt iradial}. The extraction radius should be set to the point
where the source profile merges into the background.

Having produced the source spectrum, it should be background subtracted
and exposure corrected as discussed earlier. After this a detector matrix
needs to be created using the program {\tt xrtresp}. The detector matrix is
unique for each source, being a function of off-axis angle and source
box radius. It is written directly into the spectral datafile. This file
may be used directly in the ASTERIX spectral fitting package, {\tt sfit}, or
within {\tt xspec} after format conversion by {\tt ast2xsp}.

For weak or very soft sources, modelling the particle component of the
background correctly is important. In this case the data should be
"cleaned" before sorting by only using times when the Master Veto Rate
parameter is between 0 and 170. 

\subsubsection{Extended source single spectrum}
Extended sources have higher background and so care needs to be taken
when performing the background subtraction. To help reduce the background
present in the data it is possible to "clean" the data using the Master
Veto Rate parameter, contained in the eventrate file. 
The program {\tt xrthk} may be used to generate a text file of time slots,
for when the MVR value is between 0 and 170. This typically 
results in a reduction in exposure time of about 10 \% but can significantly
reduce the background. The particle model of Snowden et al 1991, used
in the background subtraction assumes that the MVR is no greater than 
170. The text file generated by {\tt xrthk} can be used directly in
{\tt xrtsort}
to specify the time ranges wanted (see Example 2). The same time ranges
{\em must} be used when sorting the background file for the observation.

When analysing part or all of an extended source, e.g. the inner 0.1
degrees of a cluster of galaxies, there are no PSF considerations
when choosing the source box. 
However, the source box must be small enough that a single
vignetting correction (at a single off-axis angle) is appropriate for
the file. A reasonable size source box would be a circle of radius 
0.2 degrees within the inner ring, or an annulus of width 0.1 degrees 
outside the central ring. If a larger box is required, see the 
section on "radial\_spectra".

It is not always obvious which off-axis angle to use for the vignetting
correction of a large source box, centred on the optical axis. 
By default, the off-axis angle is set
as the half radius of a circle or the mid-radius of an annulus. For a point
source with a small source box this is not important, however, with a
large source box this may not be appropriate. For instance, if a circular 
source box was used with a uniform distribution of photons, then the
photon weighted mean off-axis angle would be $R / \sqrt{2}$, where R is
the radius of the box. On the other hand if the photon distribution is
strongly centrally peaked, then an off-axis angle less than the half
radius would be appropriate. In general with a smooth decrease in the
source radial profile, the half radius is the best value to use for the
mean off-axis value, however this default can be overridden on the 
command line if necessary with:

\begin{verbatim}
      > xrtcorr offax1=8.2
\end{verbatim}

Where the off-axis value is in arcminutes.

\subsubsection{Radial Spectra}
To save time analysing different sections of an extended object, it is
possible to produce a single file containing spectra at a number of
different radii. For instance a circular cluster, centred on the optical
axis, of extent 0.5 degrees, could be divided into 5 radial rings 
of width 0.1 degrees. To produce such a source file select a circular source
box in {\tt xrtsort} of radius 0.5 degrees, and select axes 7 and 8 at the
BIN\_AXIS prompt. As with extended sources, it is best to subset the
data by restricting the Master Veto Rate range to 170.

The subtraction should be performed as for an extended source, e.g. an
annular background region of radius 0.7--0.8 degrees might be appropriate.
{\tt xrtsub} and {\tt xrtcorr} will then background subtract and exposure
correct all the spectra in one go. 

If {\tt xspec} is used for spectral fitting, each spectrum may be converted
individually with {\tt ast2xsp}. The ASTERIX spectral fitting software will
work directly on a radial set of spectra, the desired spectra may be
selected with {\tt sdata} before using {\tt sfit}.

\subsubsection{Spectral analysis of the background}
To find the spectra of the cosmic background in a PSPC image,
the following procedure may be adopted. It is probably best to just
use data from within the central ring for this purpose to ensure
uniform point source rejection to a well defined threshold.

{\bf 1.} Use {\tt xrthk} to restrict the master veto rate to 170. 

{\bf 2.} Use {\tt xrtsort} to produce a square spectral\_image which includes 
    the inner ring. The spatial binsize should be about 15 arcseconds;
    any number of spectral channels may be used, but 32 or 64 is
    possibly best. A 256 by 256 by 32 spectral channel file should
    produce good results.

{\bf 3.} Use the {\tt quality} setting programs to set pixels outside a 
    radius of upto 17 arcminutes BAD and blank out the sources 
    and window support structure from the spectral image (this
    procedure is described in the section on background subtracting
    multiple point sources). 

{\bf 4.} The spectral\_image can now be compressed into a spectrum
    using {\tt project}.

{\bf 5.} Remove the particles (and detector noise) from the spectrum.
    This is accomplished by using {\tt xrtsub} to produce a spectrum 
    of the particle background by :

\begin{verbatim}
        a) xrtsub spectrum spec_image part_file=parts

           This just uses xrtsub to generate the particle file, throw
           away the subtracted file that it produces. This assumes that the
           spectral file is called spectrum.sdf and the spectral image,
           spec_image.sdf

        b) subtract spectrum parts

           Use to subtract the particles from the background spectrum
\end{verbatim}

{\bf 5.} Exposure correct the spectrum with:

\begin{verbatim}
        > xrtcorr offax1=n.n
\end{verbatim}

{\tt xrtcorr} will use an inappropriate default for the off-axis angle of this
spectrum. It must be supplied with the area weighted mean off-axis
angle of the photons, this is $R/\sqrt{2}$, where R is
the radius of the circular region specified with the quality setting
programs. OFFAX1 is in arcminutes.

{\bf 6.} {\tt xrtresp} will attatch a detector response structure using
instrument information calculated by {\tt xrtcorr}.  The default matrix should
be used with observations after mid 1991.  

\subsubsection{Spectra of many sources}
A common requirement in ROSAT analysis is to improve the signal to 
noise ratio by combining spectra from many similar sources in the same
field, e.g. AGN in a deep exposure field. Strictly speaking this is 
incorrect because a separate detector matrix is required for
each source, depending 
on the off-axis angle and the source extraction radius. However, if this
point is born in mind and the analysis is restricted to sources within
the central ring it is possible to use the technique.

Each source required should be extracted using a circular box with a
fixed radius. If all the sources are faint then {\tt xrtmspec} may be used
to extract each spectrum. This procedure uses an extraction radius of
0.01 degrees which is too small for bright sources ($>100$ counts). If
one or more bright sources are present, then {\tt xrtmspec} should be modified
to use a larger radius or each source should be extracted separately with
{\tt xrtsort}. Each source {\em must} be extracted with the same radius.

The spectra may be added together using:

\begin{verbatim}
        > meandat average=no
\end{verbatim}

This program adds the counts from each input spectrum. 
Subsequent programs will use the
off-axis angle from the first file used in {\tt meandat} to calculate the 
energy dependent corrections for the combined spectrum, so it is 
important that the first datafile is at an average 
off-axis angle for all the sources.
The resultant datafile may be subtracted and corrected as described earlier.

\subsection{Time series analysis}
ROSAT flies a near circular low earth orbit. The drawback of
such an orbit is that periodically the satellite must stop observing while
it passes through regions of high particle background such as the South 
Atlantic Anomoly. A {\em ROSAT} time series of greater than 30 minutes duration 
may have gaps in it due to this effect; this causes     difficulties for
traditional time series analysis routines. The ASTERIX document, USER\_006, 
provides a summary of the routines within ASTERIX which have
been designed to overcome this problem.

Analysis of PSPC data is further complicated by the window support
structure. The detector is continually wobbled while observing 
to ensure that sources are not continuously hidden behind the 
fine wire mesh of the 
support structure. This means that a source will continually pass under 
wires and its flux will be modulated at the wobble period, (about 
six minutes). Sources outside the central ring are less prone to this effect
because of the wide PSF at high off-axis angles. 

A time series may be background subtracted if required in a similar
manner to the spectral datasets mentioned earlier. It is likely that 
several of the time bins in the file will be only partly exposed and so 
it is important that the data is exposure corrected with {\tt xrtcorr} before
being analysed. 

Due to the nature of ROSAT observations there can be very long
gaps between data in a time series. To save disk space and processing time,
the gaps in the time series may be removed with the program {\tt streamline}.

The program {\tt lombscar} provides a good technique for searching for peaks
in the power spectrum of 'gappy' data.

\subsubsection{Barycentric correction}
There is currently no way to correct for the motions of the satellite and
the Earth from within ASTERIX.  However there are two FTOOLS available
{\tt abc} and {\tt bct}, wrapped up in a script {\tt rosbary} which may be
of some use.  These programs will not work on old MPE style datasets.

\subsection{Image analysis}
Images may be sorted over any energy range with {\tt xrtsort}. Occasionally,
observations are incorrectly processed by the SASS pre-processing
software and aspect errors are introduced. This is often the result of
a poor attitude solution from the star-trackers onboard ROSAT
and results in photons appearing in a different part of the image
from where they were recorded. A sign that this may have happened
is if sources appear to be elongated along the wobble direction.
If it is suspected that an observation contains aspect problems or if
very accurate work, e.g. a search for source extension, is being undertaken,
the problem can be reduced by subsetting the data on the aspect error
(ASP\_ERR) housekeeping parameter, contained in the attitude
file. {\tt xrthk} should be used to
produce a file of times when the aspect error parameter was between 0 and 1.
An image should then be produced with {\tt xrtsort}
between these times. At the same time, the Master Veto Rate parameter
may be used to reduce the background in the image.

The image may be background subtracted using the methods outlined in 
the "Background subtraction" section. 

{\tt xrtcorr} may be used to exposure correct an image. This includes a vignetting
correction, but it should be remembered that this correction
when applied to an image is only approximate because 
vignetting is calibrated in terms of energy and not pulse height channel.

The image may be manipulated in a wide variety of ways using {\tt
Isys} and the command driven image processing, within ASTERIX. 
See "{\tt asthelp} image" for details.

\subsubsection{Energy Mapping}
PSPC data contains energy as well as spatial information. It is possible
to indicate this on an image by producing an {\em energy map}. This may
be done in two ways :

{\bf 1.} Produce a spectral image, with 4-8 spectral channels. \\
{\bf 2.} Run {\tt enmap} with a suitable threshold (See the help entry). \\
{\bf 3.} Plot the result with {\tt idisplay}. \\

or by producing a 3-colour image, \\

{\bf 1.} Produce a low energy (chns: 8-40), medium energy (41-100) 
and high energy (101-200) image of the same region. \\
{\bf 2.} Combine these with {\tt mkcolim}. \\
{\bf 3.} Display after using {\tt icolour rgb}. \\

The first method is suitable for low signal to noise data whereas the 
3-colour image method works well on bright objects.

\subsubsection{Radial profiling}
A radial profile of a source may be produced with the {\tt iradial}
command. If the region of interest is contaminated by another source
or intersects the window support structure, the image may be cleaned 
before starting the analysis. A typical procedure may be :

\begin{verbatim}
        icl> idisplay im1           ! Display the image 
        icl> iregion                ! Choose the areas to set bad 
        icl> iexclude curr          ! Set these areas bad 
        icl> iradial                ! Produce the radial profile
        icl> isave1d im1_radp       ! Save the radial profile 
        icl> exit
\end{verbatim}

The saved radial profile may be analysed in detail with {\tt qdp}
if required after using the {\tt astqdp} command.

The above example uses the command driven image processing commands.
The same sequence, including the export to {\tt qdp}, can be performed
purely within {\tt Isys}.

\subsubsection{Test for extension}
A source may be tested for extension using the following procedure:

\begin{verbatim}
        icl> idisplay
        icl> icentroid            ! Find the centre of the source 
        icl> imode key            ! Switch to keyboard mode 
        icl> iradial              ! Produce a radial profile 
        icl> ipsf                 ! Compare with the expected PSF 
\end{verbatim}

{\tt ipsf} allows several PSF functions to be compared against the 
radial profile. The PSPC options may be accessed by selecting XRT\_PSPC.
The best options at present are, ONAXIS\_3 if the source is on
axis or VARPROFILE if it is off axis. The routine gives a $\chi^{2}$
value for the quality of the fit.

NB: if a source appears to be extended, the image should be
sorted over times when the aspect error value was low, to minimise 
possible aspect errors, and the above procedure repeated.

\subsection{Count rates and source searching}
Quick source counts and count rates may be extracted from a PSPC
observation with the image processing system. e.g. 

\begin{verbatim}
        icl> xrtsort              ! Sort an image
        icl> iload image xwin     ! Start the image processing system
        icl> idisplay             ! Display the image 
        icl> icircstats           ! Find the counts in a source
\end{verbatim}

To determine accurate source counts, the source searching routine, 
{\tt pss} should be used. This routine provides a sensitive means of 
finding the sources in an XRT observation. 
Full details are given in the help and in the document,
USER\_004. It has a large number of operational modes but the
following method works well for finding sources and obtaining count rates
from a PSPC image.

{\bf 1.} Produce a background model image using {\tt xrtsub}. This program 
creates a model of background by scaling the vignetting function as a
function of energy using a {\em source free} portion of the input data
and adding an estimate of the particle background (which is not vignetted). 
The simplest way to do this is to create a spectrum of a blank region 
using {\tt xrtsort}.
The lower and upper bounds in channels {\em must} be {\em exactly} the
same as used to create the image to be searched by {\tt pss}, and the
spectrum should contain between 4 and 10 bins. For instance
if the image was sorted over the corrected PH range 8-247, then the spectrum
must be produced over the same 240 channels and may consist of 4,6,8, or 10
bins. 

Invoke {\tt xrtsub} giving it the image you want to search at the SOURCE prompt,
your background spectrum at the BCKGND prompt, and supply it with a file
name for the background model using the BGMODEL parameter. It will also 
output a background subtracted copy of the SOURCE image using the OUT
parameter. {\tt pss} can accept either the raw image or the background
subtracted image.

{\bf 2.} Run {\tt pss} using the XRT\_PSPC VARPROFILE option in POLAR mode
as the PSF and giving the background image generated above as the 
background (BGND) option. See Example 3. {\tt pss} produces two outputs,
a significance map and source list. The first of these is optional
but useful in diagnosing problems. It is a map over the image region
searched of the likelihood ratio of the two models {\em background 
only} and {\em background + point source}. {\tt pss} searches for points
in this map above a user supplied threshold, identifies these as
sources and finds confidence intervals on the parameters describing
the source, ie. flux, X and Y. The flux output is in raw counts and
takes into account the fact that not all of the psf may be included
in the search box.

{\bf 3.} The source list from {\tt pss} may be displayed to the screen, file
or printer using the {\tt ssdump} command. 

{\bf 4.} The source counts in the list produced by {\tt pss} may be exposure 
      corrected using {\tt xpsscorr}.

{\tt xpsscorr} can be used to convert the source counts calculated by {\tt pss}
into a count rate. This is the count rate which would have been 
observed had the source been on axis. It does this by dividing by the
exposure time and by using calibration files to determine the 
vignetting. By default it also multiplies by a factor 1.0/0.79 to
correct for the absorption by the fine wires in the support structure. 

Alternatively the merged exposure map which is provided with each observation
may be used to calculate the exposure time. This latter approach has
the advantage of coping with sources which are partially obscured by
the window support structure, however, it is only valid for images
produced over the full time range and over the full pulse height
channel range. Any subset of these quantities will invalidate the use
of the exposure map.

With either method, the wire correction may be turned off by specifying
"wires=no" on the command line. If the count rates are going to be
subsequently converted into a flux using the effective area files or
used within spectral fitting, the wire correction should NOT be applied as
it is already included in the detector matrix.

{\bf 5.} Source positions can be marked on the displayed image using
{\tt imark}, or added as permanent annotations in the presentation graphics
using {\tt ssanot}.    

{\bf 6.} Time series or spectra can be extracted for every source in a
   {\tt pss} list using the {\tt xrtmtime} and {\tt xrtmspec} procedures
   respectively.

{\bf 7.} The whole process can be performed iteratively. To refine your
background estimate those regions of the image input to {\tt xrtsub} containing
sources can be masked out using {\tt iregion} and {\tt iexclude} or {\tt Isys}.
This produces a background unbiased by the presence of point sources which
can then be used in {\tt pss} again.

\subsection{HRI}
Before starting to analyse HRI data you should obtain a copy of the calibration
report (ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/rosat/doc/hri/HRI_report)

HRI data are sorted in an identical manner to PSPC data. The HRI has 
16 pulse height channels, which give very limited energy resolution. It is not
yet possible within ASTERIX to make use of this aspect of the data
except to subset the data on PH channel within {\tt xrtsort}.

Source spectra are significantly more peaked than background spectra
and an improvement in signal to noise may result from restricting the
channel range to 3--8, although the exact channel range will vary
from one source to the next.

\subsection{Background subtraction}
Basic background subtraction may be performed with {\tt xrtsub}. This will
subtract the background after normalising for area. At present
the software does not perform any correction for the different detector
efficiencies at the source and background box positions.

Alternatively, since most of the background is due to particles, it would
also be possible simply to subtract a flat background. Software to help
determine the level of this may be obtained from:

\begin{verbatim}
 ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/ in directory /rosat/publications/diff_bkgrd/temp
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Exposure correction} 
The exposure correction program, {\tt xrtcorr} performs dead-time corrections,
correction for the mirror vignetting, and correction for the quantum
efficiency of the detector.  All corrections are carried out according
to formulae given in the Calibration Report.  The one slight exception to
this is the quantum efficiency correction. The QE of the detector is 
provided as a 2-D map in detector coordinates.  To apply this to data
binned in world coordinates it is radially binned, and the averaged
correction applied only as a function of radial offset from the centre of
the FOV.
\subsection{Source searching}
The source search program uses the point spread function as specified
in the calibration report.

\section{A description of the PSF}
 
The ROSAT PSF describes the  spatial response of  the instrument to a point
source resulting from the scattering of photons due  to mirror figuring and
irregularities, and physical limitations of the detector. This response also
varies with energy.

The PSF results from a number of factors;

ON AXIS effects - see OGIP calibration memo. CAL/ROS/92-001
\begin{itemize}
\item A scattering effect  - caused by irregularities in the surface of the mirror.
\item A penetration effect - due to the varying depth penetration of X-rays in the counter gas.
\item A resolution effect  - because of the  manner in which electrons are generated.
\item Image ghosting    - in PHA channels less than channel 15. 
\item An ellipsoid blur    - due to the uncorrected attitude motion.
\end{itemize}

OFF AXIS effect - see OGIP calibration memo. CAL/ROS/93-015
\begin{itemize}
\item A blur effect - the blur of the XMA
\end{itemize}

There are a number of broad PSF issues which also bear consideration including;

\begin{itemize}
\item Dependence of the PSF upon off-axis angle.
\item Speed of processing PSFs.     
\item Size of PSF arrays. 
\item PSF accuracy.
\item Energy dependence of the PSF.
\item Re-calibrations which create new PSFs.
\item Instrument dependence of PSFs.
\end{itemize}

The PSF  has  to  be considered   to  perform an  optimal   analysis of  an
observation, in {\tt pss} for example.

Attempts  to improve the calculation  of the PSF and re-calibrations before and
after the satellite launch is one reason for the number of PSF options.

Because ASTERIX  is designed  as a multi-mission program it  facilitates the
inclusion  of instrument dependent code  for the PSF by  the use  of a PSF data
routines  library which  it  accesses   using  PSF system  routines.   (See
{\tt Prog/011})

The PSF system controls access to the numerous PSF options which are
presented to the user in the ASTERIX PSF user interface as follows;

\begin{verbatim}
        PSF system options :
 
        ANALYTIC       ASCA           EXOLE          PWFC           RADIAL
        RESPFILE       TABULAR        WFC            XRT_HRI        XRT_PSPC
 
        CSPEC(PSF/model,spec[,nbin])
        POLAR(PSF,rbin[,abin])        RECT(PSF,xbin[,ybin])

        PSF - Choose PSF to use for source model /'XRT_PSPC'/ >   
        MASK - PSPC PSF option (LIST for descriptions) /'VARPROFILE'/ > 
        Loaded XRT PSF cube with 10 energy channels
        AUX - Mean photon energy in KeV > 
        PSFRES - Enter PSF resolution in degrees > 
        PSFRAD - Maximum size of PSF in pixels >
\end{verbatim}

The  ANALYTIC option provides  simple analytical PSF descriptions while the
ASCA and  EXOLE   options are concerned  with   other missions.   The  WFC,
XRT\_HRI and  XRT\_PSPC refer  to  different ROSAT instruments   which each
require their own PSF.

\begin{verbatim}
        PWFC
        - The WFC in pointed mode 
        WFC 
        - The WFC in survey mode 
        XRT_HRI 
        - The ROSAT XRT, HRI detector 
        XRT_PSPC
        - The ROSAT XRT, PSPC 1 and 2 detectors 
\end{verbatim}

The RESPFILE and TABULAR options are an  attempt to increase the processing
speed in a PSF program. If a dataset repeatedly requires  a PSF the PSF can
be created and either kept in  a separate file or attached  to the dataset. 
The  TABULAR option reads in data  from a 2D  binned dataset written by the
{\tt crepsf} application.  The program {\tt spresp} creates the PSF SPatial
RESPonse  and  attaches it  to  the dataset  where it  can   be recalled if
required by selecting the RESPFILE  option.  These options are most  useful
in applications which make very intensive use of the psf. If such intensive
use is not envisaged it is better to keep using the normal psf system.

\subsection{PSPC Options and Masks}
 
The XRT\_PSPC is  the option for the  ROSAT PSPC for  which  four MASKS are
provided: VARPROFILE, VARGAUSSIAN, ONAXIS\_2,ONAXIS\_3

ONAXIS\_3 is the  recommended MASK if the source  is on  axis.  

The  ONAXIS\_3  mask returns a   single  on-axis PSF.  It  combines three
functions which account    for three of the  factors   which  make up   the
composite on-axis PSF;
\begin{verbatim}
        - primary electron generation is represented by a Gaussian function
        - penetration of the counter gases which is an exponential function
        - mirror scattering which is a Lorentzian function
\end{verbatim}      
        
At greater  than 20  arc minutes off  axis  the  off-axis blur becomes  the
dominant factor in the PSF and causes a noticable asymemetry in the
distribution of source counts. Because of the blur effect a PSF which varies
with off-angle is a more widely preferred option. 

VARPROFILE is the recommended MASK if the source is off axis.

The VARPROFILE  mask  attempts to   account for off-axis  angle and  energy
dependence by creating a variable PSF.

In order to   increase processing speed  the  VARPROFILE mask uses a  `data
cube' - a file in which calibration data has been pre-processed and stored.
The  values of radius   contained in US   Rod Calibration Tables  have been
transformed   into the `data cube'  with  ENERGY, OFF  AXIS  and RADIAL BIN
components.  The `data cube' applies  to the whole  ROSAT field of view and
can be used to calculate an individual PSF for each  data set.  The comment
`Loaded XRT PSF cube with 10 energy  channels' indicates that the data cube
has been loaded.

\begin{verbatim}
        THE CUBE'S DIMENSIONS

        DATA CUBE   BINS VALUES

        ENERGY      1-10    0.1 - 2.0keV
        OFF AXIS    1-30    2 arcmin
        RADIAL BIN  1-40    0.018 arcmin       
\end{verbatim}

The  `data cube' is used  by  the program to  calculate   the PSF which  is
contained  in a  data  structure composed of  a  series of  2D arrays.  The
VARPROFILE option creates the data structure after having prompted the user
for values which determine the off-axis bin size and array dimensions.  The
PSF at each off-axis bin is read into the 2D array as a value of integrated
probability.

An application applies the PSF  to each point in a  data set depending upon
which off-axis bin  the  point falls  in.  For  the VARPROFILE mask  it  is
recommended that the data  structure which is created  is of the order of -
30 off axis bins * 2D arrays of 10 pixels wide.

With  the VARPROFILE mask  the user will  be prompted for three values AUX,
PSFRES, PSFRAD which are important in determining the size  of the PSF data
structure.

The AUX value  provides the program with a  value of mean photon energy  in
KeV. For typical source spectra 0.5keV is  a recommended value for AUX. For
very hard or soft sources other values may be required - look at a spectrum
of the source to decide.

\begin{itemize}
\item{The PSFRES is a  value of resolution   entered in degrees. Both PSFRES  and
pixel size  are  used to  determine the number  of off-axis  bins for which
separate PSF arrays  will be created.  The PSF  arrays are filled  from the
pre-loaded 'data cube' which divides the off-axis into 30 bins [ie.  a size
of  2 arc minutes].   A  value of PSFRES  which  returns around 30 bins  is
therefore recommended.}

\item{Using a higher PSFRES creates a larger number  of PSFs.  This has speed and
storage implications but,  by interpolation, a  larger PSF array will apply
the PSF more smoothly when the source is off axis.}

\item{The  PSFRAD is an integer which  is used to indicate  the dimensions of the
PSF array to be created.  The PSF array values are calculated from the data
cube and the   pixel size is  determined  by  the data_set.   If  the array
dimensions makes the  PSF array larger than  the outside radial  bin of the
cube then the outer  PSF values are filled  with zeros. Ideally the program
should prompt the user to indicate the maximum PSF size to use.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HRI Option}

 The HRI model is an analytic fit to the in-flight response,
 performed by MPE/GSFC/SAO. The functional form is,

\begin{verbatim}
 PSF = A1*EXP(-0.5*(R/S1)**2) + A2*EXP(-0.5*(R/S2)**2) + EXP(-R/S3)
\end{verbatim}

 where the radial distance R from the PSF centre is in arcseconds.
 The constants A(n) and S(n) have values,

\begin{verbatim}
    A1 = 0.9638 S1 = 2.1858"
    A2 = 0.1798 S2 = 4.0419"
    A3 = 0.001168 S3 = 31.69"
\end{verbatim}

 This model provides a reasonable description of the psf out to
 radii of 100", but does not model the azimuthal asymmetry
 present within R less than 12". 
 
 This model does not vary with position in the field of view.

\section{A quick guide}

\subsection{PSPC}

This section gives brief details of the programs needed to process an
XRT observation.

ROSAT data may be obtained from a data tape or from the Leicester data
archive. In either case all the raw data files should be copied into
a single directory. It is important that this directory does not
contain any raw datafiles from another observation as this can cause
problems with the pre-processing.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Run {\tt xrtconv } on the raw dataset to convert into ASTERIX format.}
\item{Running program{\tt showxrt} will produce a summary of the observation, listing
information such as target name, pointing direction and exposure time.}
\item{The program {\tt xrthk} may be used to "clean" the data by
producing a file of times when the background was low.}
\item{{\tt xrtsort} can now be used to sort the data directly into an
ASTERIX data file.  Example 1 shows {\tt xrtsort} being used to create an
image.  If a file of time slots has been created with {\tt xrthk} this
can be used in {\tt xrtsort} when sorting the data (see Example 2).}
\item{The data can be background subtracted with the program {\tt
xrtsub}.  A background file should first be sorted from a blank area
of sky with {\tt xrtsort}.}
\item{{\tt xrtcorr} is used to exposure correct a dataset.  This
includes corrdctions for instrumental effects, such as vignetting,
dead time as well as normalisation to on-axis counts/sec.}
\item{A detector matrix needs to be produced with {\tt xrtresp} before
spectral fitting can be performed.  To use {\tt xspec} convert the
files using {\tt ast2xsp}.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HRI}
Processing of HRI data preceeds on an identical path to PSPC data,
with the obvious omission of the spectral fitting.

\newpage
\section{Housekeeping and calibration data}
A list of the important housekeeping parameters are included later in this
document (Appendix 4).
{\tt plotxy} may be used to plot one array in a file against
another.  e.g. to display the ASP\_ERR value as a function of time.

\begin{verbatim}
    plotxy sa_att.time sa_att.asp_err
\end{verbatim}

Plots of the vignetting function are given in 
Figures 5 \& 6. The vignetting function is defined at fourteen different
off-axis angles from 0--60 arcminutes. 

The approximate relationship between pulse height channel and energy
for the PSPC is $E=(Ch.No.) / 100$ keV, e.g. channel 100 is approximately 
1.0 keV.

To plot the relative vignetting on-axis against that at 15 arcminutes:

\begin{verbatim}
    plotxy $XRTCAL/pspcb_eff.effar_1 $XRTCAL/pspcb_eff.effar_4
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt xspokes} program uses the satellite roll angle to determine the 
position of the window support structure on the image. This system
can be flawed if an observation has been performed in two sections,
with the satellite at different roll angles. To check the roll angle :

\begin{verbatim}
    plotxy rtname_att.time rtname_att.roll 
\end{verbatim}

Where rtname is the rootname selected for the files. The roll angle is
stored in the file rtname\_att\_extra in a US observation.

The sky pixels are defined and numbered differently in the US and MPE datafiles.
US data increases from bottom to top, so for the PSPC, the 
bottom left hand corner 
pixel is 1,1. MPE pixel numbers decrease with increasing Y value, so
the bottom left hand pixel is -7680,7680 and the top left hand corner
pixel is -7680,-7680. Corrected PH channels have the same meaning in
the two datasets, but the US supply channels 0--255 for PSPC data 
whereas the MPE
data ranges from 1--256. The channel 0 PSPC data in the US files 
may not be used within ASTERIX.
