#  Name:
#     ast_link_ftool

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against ADAM ASTERIX.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building ADAM applications
#     which use ASTERIX in order to generate the correct arguments for the
#     compiler (or ld) command. The arguments generated are written to
#     the standard output.

#  Invocation:
#     The script may be invoked as part of a command such as:
#
#         f77 -o program program.f `ast_link_ftool`
