*+  MATH_INTEGRATE - Uses Rhomberg's method to integrate a function.
      SUBROUTINE MATH_INTEGRATE (MAX_K, MIN_K, CHANGE, START, STOP, Fn,
     :                              WORK1, WORK2, WORK3, ANSWER, STATUS)
*    Description :
*     Integrates the DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION Fn(x) from START to STOP using
*     Rhomberg's method.
*
*     The function must be specified in the calling application, and
*     declared as EXTERNAL. It must be able to return the value of the
*     function for ANY value of x in the range START to STOP.
*
*     Any extra variables required by Fn must be passed to it via COMMON blocks.
*
*     The integration is REPEATED with K = K + 1 untill the desired accuracy,
*     expressed as the fractional change in the value of the integral
*     between one value of K and the next, is achieved, or untill K > MAX_K.
*
*     Idealy MAX_K should be chosen so that it is just large enough to give
*     the desired accuracy. MIN_K can then be MAX_K - 1.
*
*     For normal use, set MAX_K to something large (but not too large as there
*     are 2 work arrays of length 1+2^MAX_K), and set MIN_K to 1.
*
*     If MIN_K = MAX_K this routine will complain that it could not test the
*     accuracy of its solution. STATUS is not altered as the answer is
*     'correct' i.e. the best estimate possible with that value of K.
*
*     If the desired accuracy is not reached the application will also complain.
*     Again STATUS is not altered as the best estimate of the integral possible
*     with the given value of MAX_K has been obtained.
*    Method :
*     For a given value of K a series of trapezoidal approximations to the
*     integral using 1, 2, 4, ... 2^K panels are made. These are then combined,
*     useing Rhomberg's method, to eliminate errors to give a far superior
*     estimate of the value of the integral.

*+  MATH_INTKING2D - Return array of integrated 2D King profile distribution
      SUBROUTINE MATH_INTKING2D( RC, ALPHA, X0, Y0, QX, QY,
     :                           DX, DY, NX, NY, ARRAY, STATUS )
*
*    Description :
*
*     The value of the integrated unit normalised King distribution
*     described by RC,ALPHA (core radius & index) is found for each
*     element of ARRAY.
*
*     The King profile is centred at 0,0. The centre of ARRAY is X0,Y0.
*
*    Method :
*
*     Each pixel of ARRAY is subdivided in X and Y depending on the
*     distance in terms of RC in each axis at that point. The formula used
*     coded in the function SPIX. The sub-pixelling is given by 10
*     times the binsize / sigma, modified by SQRT(offset/rc) to
*     tend to unity for large offsets. This combines high accuracy
*     where the gradient is highest, with fast operation in large
*     areas at large sigma values.
*
*     The spot value of the King profile is found in each sub-pixel, the
*     sum of the sub-pixels contributing to each major (ARRAY) pixel.
*     The normalisation of the King profile in 2 dimensions is
*     PI * RC^2 / (ALPHA-1).
*
*     The case where the array centre coincides with the centre of
*     the profile is handled separately as there is 4-fold symmetry
*     about X and Y axes.
