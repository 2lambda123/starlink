*
* THE RADIUS (ARCMIN) THAT ENCIRCLES FRACTION F OF FLUX AT DIFFERENT ENERGIES
*
*
* The telescope component, TELRAD, was derived by subtracting quadratically
* the detector component at 0.5 keV as given in the OGIP calibration Memo
* from the total PSF given in the American ROD table.
* Values derived by LTVAD::IG  16/9/1992
* Updated values derived by IG 5/10/1992
* Local constants :
      INTEGER MAXENG
        PARAMETER (MAXENG=5)
      INTEGER MAXFRAC
        PARAMETER (MAXFRAC=10)
* Local variables :
      REAL DEFENG(MAXENG)         ! Energies at which the detector PSF is def'd
      REAL FRAC(MAXFRAC)          ! Fractions at which the PSF is determined
      REAL TELRAD(MAXFRAC,0:60)   ! The telescope PSF radii (arcmins)
      REAL DETRAD(MAXFRAC,MAXENG) ! The detector PSF radii (arcmins)
*
* Must make 6 small arrays to hold the telescope contributions,
* because the number of continuation lines is limited.
