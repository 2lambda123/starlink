#        intermediate files created during the building process.
#     make executable
#        Causes make to remove those files not required for an executable
#        version of :PKG:
#     make rebuild
#        Causes make to clean up after building the package, deleting all
#        intermediate and target files created during the building process.
#     make install
#        Causes make to install components of the built package into the
#        appropriate directories on Starlink machines.
#     make deinstall
#        Causes make to de-install components of the built package from the
#        appropriate directories on Starlink systems.
#     make unbuild
#        Remove those files not in the distributed :PKG: system. Assumed
#        to work from an installed system
#
#  External Dependencies:
#     The :PKG: help system depends on the following external files and 
#     systems, which must previously have been installed in the appropriate 
#     Starlink directories:
