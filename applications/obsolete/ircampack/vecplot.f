      SUBROUTINE VECPLOT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     VECPLOT

*  Purpose:
*     Plots a 2-d vector map

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL VECPLOT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application plots vectors defined by the values contained
*     within a pair of 2-d NDFs, the first holding the magnitude of the
*     vector quantity at each pixel, and the second holding the
*     corresponding vector orientations. The number of vectors in the
*     plot is kept to a managable value by only plotting vectors for
*     pixels on a sparse regular matrix. The increment (in pixels)
*     between plotted vectors is given by parameter STEP. Zero
*     orientation may be fixed at any position angle within the plot by
*     specifying an appropriate value for parameter ANGROT. Each vector
*     may be represented either by an arrow or by a simple line, as
*     selected by parameter VTYPE.
*
*     The plot is situated within the current graphics-database
*     picture, and may reside within optional, annotated and enumerated
*     axes.  An optional, but recommended, key may be drawn to the
*     right of the plot.  It reports the data units if there are any
*     (taken from the NDF associated with parameter NDF1) and gives the
*     scale used for drawing the vectors in data units per centimetre.
*     It also displays a typical vector and the corresponding data
*     value. The justification of the vector is indicated by a small
*     circle placed at the position of the corresponding pixel centre.
*
*     If the current graphics-database picture is a DATA picture or
*     contains a DATA picture (such as created by the applications
*     DISPLAY, CONTOUR, etc), then the vector plot is overlayed on
*     top of the existing DATA plot. In this case any requested
*     annotation and key are drawn outside the DATA picture but within
*     the current picture. If there is insufficient room within the
*     currrent picture, then the annotation and/or key may not be
*     drawn. The user is warned if this happens but the application
*     continues. If no DATA picture can be found within the current
*     picture then the user specifies ther total size of the plot frame
*     using parameters PXSIZE and PYSIZE, but the application itself
*     chooses how to position the vector plot and key within this
*     frame.

*  Usage:
*     VECPLOT NDF1 NDF2 [COMP] [STEP] [VSCALE] [VTYPE] [JUST] [KEY]
*             [DEVICE] 

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ABSLAB  =  LITERAL (Read)
*        Label for the plot abscissa, in which NCAR fancy founts may be
*        embedded when FONT = "NCAR".  If axis information is present
*        in NDF1 the suggested default is the axis label from NDF1
*        followed by the units, in parentheses.  If an error occurs
*        obtaining the label the suggested default is "X". []
*     ANGROT = _REAL (Read)
*        A rotation angle in degrees to be added to each vector
*        orientation before plotting the vectors (see parameter NDF2).
*        [0.0]
*     AXES = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        True if labelled and annotated axes are to be drawn around the
*        plot.  The annotations are either the data co-ordinates from
*        the axis components of NDF1, provided these are present and
*        linear and COSYS = "DATA"; otherwise pixel co-ordinates are
*        used.
*     BORDER = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        True if a box is to be drawn about the plot. This is only
*        accessed if no axes are drawn. [TRUE]
*     CLEAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        True if the graphics device is to be cleared before display
*        of the array. [TRUE]
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The component of NDF1 which is to be used to define the vector
*        magnitudes. It may be "Data", or "Variance". The vector
*        orientations are always defined by the "Data" component of
*        NDF2. ["Data"]
*     COSYS = LITERAL (Read)
*        The co-ordinate system to be used.  This can be either "WORLD"
*        or "DATA".  "WORLD" makes pixel co-ordinates to appear on axes.
*        If COSYS = "DATA" the axis information from NDF1 is used to
*        annotate axes (if it exists).  [Current co-ordinate system]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The plotting device. [Current image-display device]
*     FONT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The fount to be used for the line graphics.  It can be either
*        "NCAR" for the NCAR fancy characters and "GKS" for the standard
*        GKS san-serif fount.   The former is intended for hardcopy
*        publication-quality plots, since it is relatively slow; the
*        latter is intended for normal interactive graphics requiring
*        rapid plotting, and it is clearer on small plots. The
*        suggested default is the current value. ["GKS"]
*     JUST = LITERAL (Read)
*        The justification for each vector; can take any of the
*        following values:
*
*         "Centre" - The vectors are drawn centred on the
*                    corresponding pixel.
*
*         "Start"  - The vectors are drawn starting at the
*                    corresponding pixel
*
*         "End"    - The vectors are drawn ending at the corresponding
*                    pixel.  ["CENTRE"]
*     KEY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        True if a key is to be produced. [TRUE]
*     KEYVEC = _REAL (Read)
*        Length of the vector to be displayed in the key, in data units.
*        A default value is generated based on the spread of vector
*        lengths in the plot. []
*     MAJTIC( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The parameter controlling the numbers of major tick marks
*        for the x and y axes.  (Number used is between MAJTIC+2 and
*        5*MAJTIC/2+4.) [3.,3.]
*     MINTIC( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The number of minor tick marks between each major tick mark
*        for the x and y axes.  A negative value forces the graphics
*        package to compute appropriate values. [-1.,-1.]
*     NDF1 = NDF (Read)
*        NDF structure containing the 2-d image giving the vector
*        magnitudes.
*     NDF2 = NDF (Read)
*        NDF structure containing the 2-d image giving the vector
*        orientations.The values are considered to be in units of
*        degrees unless the "UNITS" component of the NDF has the value
*        "Radians" (case insensitive). The positive y axis defines zero
*        orientation, and rotation from the x axis to the y axis is
*        considered positive.
*     ORDLAB  =  LITERAL (Read)
*        Label for the plot ordinate, in which NCAR fancy founts may be
*        embedded when FONT = "NCAR".  If axis information is present
*        in NDF1 the suggested default is the axis label from NDF1
*        followed by the units, in parentheses.  If an error occurs
*        obtaining the label the suggested default is "Y". []
*     OUTTIC = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        True if the axis tick marks are to appear on the outside of
*        the axes instead of inside. By default, the tick marks are
*        drawn outside the plotting region to eliminate
*        intersections of ticks with the vectors. [TRUE]
*     PLTITL = LITERAL (Read)
*        The title of the plot.  Up to about 40 characters can be
*        accommodated, and NCAR fancy founts may be embedded when FONT =
*        "NCAR". If an error occurs obtaining the title, it is
*        defaulted to "VECPLOT map".  [The title from NDF1]
*     PXSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The length (x axis) of the plot in metres. [Maximum that can
*        fit in the current picture whilst preserving square pixels]
*     PYSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The length (y axis) of the plot in metres. [Maximum that can
*        fit in the current picture whilst preserving square pixels]
*     STEP = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of pixels between adjacent displayed vectors (along
*        both axes). Increasing this value reduces the number of
*        displayed vectors. The default value gives about 30 vectors 
*        along the longest axis of the plot. []
*     THICK = _REAL (Read)
*        The thickness of the axes and annotations in the plot, where
*        1.0 is the normal thickness. Currently, this is only available
*        on a few devices.  It must take a value in the range 0.5--5.0.
*        [1.0]
*     VECCOL = LITERAL (Read)
*        The colour for the vectors. The options are:
*          "MAX"          - The maximum colour index in the image 
*                           display colour lookup table.
*          "MIN"          - The minimum (non-reserved) colour index in 
*                           the image display colour lookup table.
*          An integer     - The actual colour index. It is constrained
*                           between 0 and the maximum colour index
*                           available on the device. 
*          A named colour - Uses the named colour from the palette, and
*                           if it is not present, the nearest colour
*                           from the palette is selected.
*        The suggested default is the current value. [The current value,
*        but equals "MIN" if there is no current value.] 
*     VSCALE = _REAL (Given)
*        The scale to be used for the vectors. The supplied value
*        should give the data value corresponding to a vector length of
*        one centimetre. The default makes 5% of all displayed vectors
*        larger than the interval between adjacent vectors. []
*     VTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The type of vector to be plotted; can take the value "Arrow"
*        or "Line". Vectors are drawn as arrows or lines accordingly.
*        ["LINE"]

*  Examples:
*     VECPLOT POLINT POLANG
*        Produces a vector map on the current graphics device with
*        vector magnitude taken from POLINT and vector orientation
*        taken from POLANG.  All other settings are defaulted, so
*        for example about 20 vectors are displayed along the longest
*        axis, and a key is plotted.
*     VECPLOT POLINT POLANG ANGROT=23.4 
*        Produces a vector map in which the primary axis of the vectors
*        (as defined by the value zero in the NDF "POLANG") is at the
*        position angle 23.4 degrees (measured anti-clockwise from the
*        positove Y axis) in the displayed map.
*     VECPLOT STACK(,,2) STACK(,,1) VTYPE=ARROW JUST=START NOKEY
*        Produces a vector map in which the vectors are defined by two
*        planes in the 3-d NDF "STACK". There is no need to copy the
*        two planes into two separate NDFs before running VECPLOT.
*        Each vector is represented by an arrow, starting at the
*        position of the corresponding pixel. No key to the vector scale
*        and justification is produced.

*  Notes:
*     -  The application stores a number of pictures in the graphics
*     database in the following order: a FRAME of the specified size
*     containing the title, annotated axes, vector map and key; a DATA
*     picture which is stored with world co-ordinates in units of data
*     pixels; and a KEY picture to store the key if present.  The DATA
*     picture may also have double-precision data co-ordinates derived
*     from the axis components of NDF1 provided these are linear and
*     different from pixel co-ordinates; the data co-ordinates are
*     stored via a linear transformation.  A reference to NDF1 is
*     stored with the DATA picture.  On exit the current database
*     picture for the chosen device reverts to the input picture.

*     1-MAY-1995 (DSB):
*        ANGFAC set to DTOR if no UNITS component found in NDF2 (i.e. 
*        assume angles are in degrees if units are unspecified). This
*        is what the docs says has always happened, but in fact it was
*        previously assumed that angles were in radians if units were 
*        unspecified (i.e. ANGFAC was incorrrectly set to 1.0).
