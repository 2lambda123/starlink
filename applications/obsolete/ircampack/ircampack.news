1 IRCAMPACK

 Version 1.1-2:
    Maintenance release to include the old kps1_cuxyr routine
    which has been retired from KAPPA.

 Version 1.0-1 of IRCAMPACK has been released.  This version fixes a
 bug in the VECPLOT application in which orientations supplied by
 parameter NDF2 were assumed to be in radians instead of degrees.

 Other changes at v1.0-1:

    o  New makefile and mk script.

    o  Revised linking and startup scripts.
