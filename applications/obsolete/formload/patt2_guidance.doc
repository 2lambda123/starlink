Notes for Guidance on the completion of the application form PATT2 for
observing time on the PPARC's optical and infrared telescopes.

1 USE OF FORM PATT2

Use form PATT2 only if you are applying to PATT for observing time on one of
the following telescopes:

     the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) at Siding Spring, New South
     Wales;

     the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) at the Roque de los Muchachos,
     La Palma;    *******ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION FOR (UK) PATT*******

     the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) at the Roque de los Muchachos,
     La Palma;   *******ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION FOR (UK) PATT********

     the 1.0m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope (JKT) at the Roque de los Muchachos,
     La Palma;   *******ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION FOR (UK) PATT********

     the 3.8m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) on Hawaii.

**The WHT, INT and JKT forms are to be submitted electronically for Sem 96B**

Note, however, that there are special arrangements for service schemes on these
telescopes (see notes to section 11 below).

Do not use PATT2 for applications for the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT),
the UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) or the Multi-Element Radio-Link Interferometer
MERLIN. Separate application forms for these facilities are available as
follows: for the JCMT (form PATT3) from the PATT secretariat; for the UKST,
from the Schmidt Unit, Royal Observatory Edinburgh; for MERLIN, from the
Director, NRAL, Jodrell Bank.

PATT also considers requests from UK university based personnel, including
students, for travel and subsistence to take up time awarded on non-PPARC
telescopes (or time awarded on PPARC facilities by committees other than PATT).
Applications to PATT for such support should be made on form RG2 (in the case
of PPARC research students, form S102) and must be sent to the Executive
Secretary, PATT (or PPARC Studentship Section) at the same time that
application is made to the telescope. A copy of the scientific case should
accompany the application and details of the travel and subsistence funds
required should also be included.

2 HOW TO OBTAIN FORM PATT2

WHT, INT and JKT
---------------- 
At Starlink sites:
Applications for PATT (UK) time must be made by submitting the .DAT
file which you would normally construct for FORMLOAD. This should be sent
electronically by email to:   patt@ast.cam.ac.uk  where it will be processed
and (if there are no processing problems) you will then receive an 
acknowledgement and a Reference Number. Diagrams should be sent as .ps 
files (not encapsulated) please.

It would help RGO if you run your .dat file through FORMLOAD anyway
and print (or view) the result to check that there are no errors.

AAT and UKIRT
-------------
Submit (hard copies) to PATT in the normal way using FORMLOAD.

At non-Starlink sites, copies of the FORMLOAAD program may be obtained by 
contacting Starlink (ussc@star.rl.ac.uk). 

3 NOTES ON THE COMPLETION OF THE APPLICATION FORM

A separate application form must be completed for each observing programme. Use
standard sized typescript (no smaller than 12 letters per inch and 6 lines per
inch); do not photoreduce the application form.

Section 1: Telescope. A separate application form must be completed for each
telescope requested, even if the same programme is proposed.

Section 2: Semester. Semesters are designated as follows. February 1994 - July
1994 is Semester 94A; August 1994 - January 1995 is Semester 94B; February 1995
- July 1995 is Semester 95A, etc.

Section 3: Principal Applicant (PA). The PA must be a member of the permanent
staff of an educational or research institution, or a postdoctoral fellow. The
PA may not be a student, but an application may be made on behalf of a student
with his or her supervisor as PA. During the consideration of the application
the PA may be contacted by the office or by assessors.

Section 4: Collaborators. Those applicants thought likely to participate in the
observing run should be identified; UK applicants seeking financial support
should see the notes to section 24. Space for four collaborators allowed for.

Section 5: Short title. This title (12 words maximum) should serve to identify
the proposed investigation.

Section 6: Summary. This should be a summary of the essential features of the
scientific case for support.

Section 7: Focal station, instrument, detector, gratings. Provide this 
information here and also complete the (AAT only) instrument scheduling form.
The ING Instrument Form has been discontinued for the present, so please
provide as much information here as you can.
Details of any user-supplied instruments not previously used on the telescope 
should be given on a separate page.

Section 8: Observing time requested. Observing time is offered in units of
whole nights on the AAT, the WHT and UKIRT, and whole weeks on the INT and JKT.
Enter the number of nights/weeks needed to complete the programme. PATT defines
nights as dark, grey or bright according to the proportion of dark hours
available in the night concerned: dark time is defined to be that time between
the limits of astronomical twilight when the moon is beneath the horizon.
Breakdowns of nights or weeks into dark, grey and bright are given in the PATT
Newsletter or SPECTRUM. Dark time on all optical telescopes is normally heavily
oversubscribed and should therefore only be requested if absolutely necessary;
grey time may be allocated to those programmes where dark time is not
considered essential. If you require dark time on UKIRT you should justify your
request in your main case for support in section 16.

Section 9: Long term proposals. Long term status will be granted only to
applications of very high scientific merit needing a large number of nights
over more than one semester. Enter the total number of nights/weeks needed to
complete the programme. If a proposal is awarded long term status, it is not
necessary to make reapplication in subsequent semesters; it is however
necessary to reconfirm the amount of time required at each PATT round.

Section 10: Scheduling information. Applicants must complete the panels on
preferred dates and impossible nights for the observing run. It is imperative
that all impossible nights in the semester are listed and reasons given. For
this purpose an impossible night is one on which it is not possible to observe
at least one of your target objects at a reasonable altitude at any time in the
night concerned. Teaching and other similar commitments do not count as
impossible nights. Indicate any other scheduling constraints in this section,
such as a need for simultaneity with other telescopes or satellites, dates of
occultations and necessity to avoid the Moon; if requesting grey time you
should indicate if you require the first or third quarter of the lunar month.

If the Moon is likely to be a problem positionally with respect to a (single)
target, you should work out and LIST the relevant impossible dates.

Section 11: Service observing. Investigators should indicate whether they wish
their programme to be observed in service time should it be possible. Service
observing is only offered for certain instruments and schemes vary from
telescope to telescope. Smaller requests can generally be made directly to the
telescope concerned rather than via PATT. Applicants should check the details
of these schemes; these are given in the PATT Newsletter or SPECTRUM.

Section 12: Support astronomer. Indicate what astronomical staff support is
required when observing in addition to a telescope operator. (No operator is
provided for the JKT). Support for WHT,INT and JKT is on first night only.

Section 13: List of principal targets. Details of the principal targets
referred to in the scientific case must be included here. Magnitudes and
colours should be given in systems that will enable an assessment of the
feasibility of the observations, eg of exposure times.

Section 14: Other applications. Applicants must list all other applications for
observing time on this or other telescopes or satellites for the same or
similar programmes in the coming semester. And any other telescope committees.

Section 15: Scientific justification. This section should contain the
scientific justification of the proposed investigation within the maximum of
the one side of A4 provided. One separate side of A4 paper containing 
diagrams and/or references may be attached (page 4a) if desired. If the
scientific justification exceeds one page, only the first page will be copied
to the Panel. Further supplementary material such as preprints may be provided
but will only be made available to referees and assessors: three copies should
be supplied. The information provided must be sufficiently self-contained to
enable PATT to assess the scientific merit of the proposal without reference to
other material. It should include a description of the overall aims of the
research, the order of importance of the objectives, an explanation of any
unusual methods or techniques, details of scientific results achieved from
previous time allocations and the relationship of these results and related
work elsewhere to the current work of the applicants.

Section 16: Technical information (I). Provide any additional information about
the targets, the desired signal-to-noise and the wavelength or velocity 
resolution, so that a technical assessment can be made of the feasibility of 
the proposal given the telescope and instrument configuration and the 
requested number of nights and phase of Moon.
Also describe here any NON-STANDARD technical requirements including any
software requirements.

Section 16: Technical information (II). This is an additional page for 
References and Figures (see also Section 15 -Notes).

Section 17: Backup programme. Investigators are asked to give a short abstract
of an alternative programme which they could carry out should poor observing
conditions or other unexpected problems make it impossible to run the main
programme. The backup programme is expected to use the same instrumental
configuration and setup as the main programme; give full details if this is not
the case.

Section 18: Related PATT applications. Applicants should list applications
which were submitted to PATT for any of the previous four semesters and which
relate to the present proposal. Include successful and unsuccessful
applications involving the present principal applicant, whether as PA or as a
named collaborator.

Section 19: Publications. Give a list of all publications (first author and
reference) based on usage of PATT telescopes during the same interval which
include the present principal applicant as an author, whether or not they are
related to the present application.

Section 20: Experience of observers who have not previously used the telescope.
Complete this section for anyone identified in section 4 as a possible observer
who has not used the telescope in question.

Section 21: Student research training. If the observations are primarily for a
student research training programme, give the details requested.

Section 22: PPARC research grants. If the observations are associated with a
current PPARC research grant, give the details requested.

Section 23: Travel and subsistence. This section applies to UK observers only.
PATT will only award travel, subsistence and freight costs associated with the
take up of observing time. As a general rule no more than one applicant
(excluding students) will be supported for any observing programme, or two if
the applicant's own equipment is being used: complete this section if a request
is being made for more than one observer or if freight, remote observing or
other costs are being sought. PPARC research grant funds are not awarded in
support of PPARC students, and for such students, support should be sought from
PPARC Studentship Section using form S102. Support will normally only be
provided for PPARC research students who have been identified on the PATT
application form in section 21.

Section 24: Signatures. All UK application forms must be authorised by the
appropriate university or institute authorities.

Section 25: Acknowledgement slip. Applicants are required to complete the
summary on the acknowledgement slip, which will normally be returned by the
office within 7 days.
