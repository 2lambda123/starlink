#  Name:
#     rcslink

#  Purpose:
#     Check that the current directory has a softlink to the RCS repository

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This procedure checks that the current directory contains
#     a softlink called RCS to the directory named by the PROJECTDIR
#     variable.
#
#     If the necessary softlink does not exists then it will be
#     created, if an invalid called RCS exists then an error
#     message will be output.

#  Invocation:
#     rcslink

#  Parameters:
#     None

#  Notes:
#     To test the position of the RCS directory we use /bin/pwd.
#     This is necessary as some shells (bash) track movement and
#     will only report where you think you are (even to the extent
#     that "cd RCS; cd .." will get you back to where you started
#     even though RCS is a softlink to a directory elsewhere).
