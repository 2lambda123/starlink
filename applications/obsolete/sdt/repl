#  Name:
#     repl

#  Purpose:
#     Replace reserved files into the (RCS) repository.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This command replaces modified files into the repository from which they
#     have been reserved.  It allows "wild-card" file name expansion based on
#     the set of currently reserved files.

#  Invocation:
#     repl filespec

#  Parameters:
#     filespec
#        Specification for the file(s) to be replaced (normally a "wild-card"
#        is given).

#  Examples:
#     repl manual.tex
#        Replaces the reserved file manual.tex into the repository.
#
#     repl `grp routines docs` *.h
#        Replaces all the reserved files in the "routines" and "docs" groups,
#        as well as all the reserved C include (.h) files (see the "grp"
#        command for futher details).
