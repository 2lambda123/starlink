#  Name:
#     showel

#  Purpose:
#     Produce a list of files in the (RCS) repository.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This command writes a list of the files in the repository to the
#     standard output. "Wild-card" file name expansion is performed if
#     necessary, based on the complete set of files in the repository.

#  Invocation:
#     showel [filespec]

#  Parameters:
#     filespec
#        An optional specification for the files to be listed (normally a
#        "wild-card" is given). If this is omitted, all files in the
#        repository are listed.

#  Examples:
#     showel
#        Lists all the files in the repository.
#
#     showel a*.f
#        Lists all the Fortran (.f) files in the repository whose names begin
#        with "a".

#  Notes:
#     If output is to a terminal, then one file name is listed on each line.
#     Otherwise, a space separated list is generated which is suitable for
#     supplying to other commands.
