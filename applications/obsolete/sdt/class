#  Name:
#     class

#  Purpose:
#     Create a class reference in the (RCS) repository.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This command takes a snapshot of a set of files in the repository,
#     recording their current (highest) version numbers and associating
#     them with a symbolic string. This string can then be used to 
#     recall copies of all the files at the current time.

#  Invocation:
#     class tag [filespec]

#  Parameters:
#     tag
#        The symbolic string to be used to tag the files. These
#        can be recalled using the "co -rtag RCS/*" command.
#     filespec
#        An optional list of files in the repository whose current highest
#        version number is to be recorded. If pattern matching characters are
#        included, they will be expanded using the complete set of files in
#        the repository. If this is omitted, all files in the respository are
#        recorded.

#  Examples:
#     class V4-1-6
#        Records the most recent version number of every file in the
#        repository using the tag V4-1-6. Note that the characters
#        in this string is restricted ("." is definitely not allowed).
#
#     class tmp_state *.f
#        Records the most recent version number of every Fortran (.f) file in
#        the repository in the file tmp.class.
#
#     class docs_class `grp documentation`
#        Records the most recent version number of all the files in the
#        "documentation" group in the file docs_class (see the "grp" command
#        for further details).

#  Recommended Usage:
#     It is recommended that classes be used to record details of
#     released versions (etc.) of software systems. 

#  Notes:
#     A list of all the classes which have been set is available
#     in the file RCS/.classes. It is not possible to use the same
#     name twice once any of the files have been changed.
