#  Name:
#     showres

#  Purpose:
#     Produce a list of reservations from the (RCS) repository.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This command writes a list of the files currently reserved from the
#     repository to the standard output. "Wild-card" file name expansion is
#     performed if necessary, based on the complete set of files currently
#     reserved.

#  Invocation:
#     showres [filespec]

#  Parameters:
#     filespec
#        An optional specification for the reservation(s) to be listed
#        (normally a "wild-card" is given). If this is omitted, all
#        reservations are listed.

#  Examples:
#     showres
#        Lists all the reservations from the repository.
#
#     showres n*.c
#        Lists all the .c files which are reserved from the repository and
#        whose names begin with "n".
#
#     showres `grp include_files`
#        Lists all files from the include_files group which are currently
#        reserved (see the "grp" command for further details).
#
#     details `showres`
#        Lists descriptive details of all the files currently reserved from
#        the repository.
