#  Name:
#     unres

#  Purpose:
#     Unreserve files reserved from the (RCS) repository.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This command unreserves files which have been reserved from the
#     repository. It discards any changes and removes the reserved file.
#     "Wild-card" file name expansion is performed, based on the set of
#     currently reserved files.

#  Invocation:
#     unres filespec

#  Parameters:
#     filespec
#        Specification for the file(s) to be unreserved (normally a
#        "wild-card" is given).

#  Examples:
#     unres wrong.f
#        Unreserves the file wrong.f, discarding any changes and removing the
#        file. The copy retained in the repository (and reference copy
#        directory) is that most recently inserted, replaced or flushed.
#
#     unres `grp to-do`
#        Backs out of any changes made to reserved files in the to-do group
#        (see the "grp" command for further details).

#  WARNING:
#     Use this command with the care you reserve for the UNIX "rm" command -
#     you can remove a great deal of work if you accidentally specify files you
#     didn't intend. THERE IS NO WAY OF RECOVERING THE LOST CHANGES!!
