#  Name:
#     describe

#  Purpose:
#     Associate descriptive text with a file in the (RCS) repository.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This command associates a string of descriptive text with a file in
#     the repository, over-writing any previous text. It may also be used
#     to remove the descriptive text from a file.

#  Invocation:
#     describe file [text]

#  Parameters:
#     file
#        The name of the file. It should be given exactly (no file name
#        expansion is performed by this command).
#     text
#        The descriptive text to be associated with the file (normally this
#        should be quoted as it will contain spaces, etc.). If no text is
#        given, then any existing descriptive text associated with the file
#        is removed.

#  Examples:
#     describe read.f 'Read data from the input file'
#        Associates the text 'Read data...' with the file read.f.
#
#     describe junk
#        Removes any descriptive text from the file junk.

#  Notes:
#     The descriptive text is associated with the file by RCS - it is not
#     stored within the file itself.
