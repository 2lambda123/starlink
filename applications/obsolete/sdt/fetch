#  Name:
#     fetch

#  Purpose:
#     Fetch read-only copies of files from the (RCS) repository.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This procedure fetches copies of files from the repository into the
#     current working directory. It allows "wild-card" file name expansion
#     based on the complete set of files in the repository. The fetched files
#     are read-only and are not intended for editing (the "res" command
#     should be used for this).

#  Invocation:
#     fetch filespec

#  Parameters:
#     filespec
#        Specification for the file(s) to be fetched (normally a "wild-card"
#        is given).

#  Notes:
#     The command will not over-write a writable copy of a file with a
#     read-only copy.

#  Examples:
#     fetch fred.dat bill.txt
#        Fetches read-only copies of the files fred.dat and bill.txt from the
#        repository, and puts them into your working directory.
#
#     fetch *.f
#        Fetches read-only copies of all the Fortran (.f) files in the
#        repository.
#
#     fetch `grp c_routines`
#        Fetches read-only copies of all the repository files belonging to
#        the group "c_routines" (see the "grp" command for more details).
