# Parse the output from date.

      set tmp = ` date | awk '{split($4,t,":");print t[1]t[2]t[3]}' `
# 
# Add a preceding letter (since the ADAM parameter system doesn't like
# file names beginning with a number) and prepend the process number to
# increase the resolution. Echo to standard output.
#
     set tmp = "t$$"$tmp
     echo $tmp
