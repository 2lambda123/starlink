<P>
P4 has the following types of plot available:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL ><DT>IMAGE <DD> - Plots an image in colour or greyscale using the full dynamic range of the data and the display device.
<DT>GRAPH <DD> - Plots 1-D lines graphics as summed through several rows (or columns) of the array.
<DT>OVERGRAPH <DD> - A 1-D graph on the same scale as a previous graph with the overlay in a different colour.
<DT>HISTOGRAM <DD> - Standard histogram using any number of bins. The data may be sampled with any number of steps 
  in either direction.
<DT>SURFACE <DD> - A sequence of 1-D plots offset to give the impression of a surface.
<DT>CONTOUR <DD> - A contour map derived from linear scaling, n-Sigma about the mean or increment or decrement in magnitudes,
  common logarithms or natural logarithms. The contour levels are written to <em> filename</em>_contours.lis for the plotted
  <em> filename</em>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
The data may be plotted either in axis (x,y) units or pixel (i,j) units. For example, a spectrum of a source might
be plotted  by an astronomer between, say, 2.1 - 2.5 &#181;m whereas an engineer might look at the same data from pixels
20 - 50 to see if there is any noise on the detector. The natural units of P4 are axis units. 
If you want to plot in pixel units, you must set any (or all) of the istart, iend, jstart, jend values to be
non-negative. In the latter case, the labels are ignored and a default title is printed.
