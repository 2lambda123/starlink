<H1>Ratio-ing by a Standard Star</H1>
<P>
Any spectra observed at the Earth's surface will differ from true due to
atmospheric effects, particularly wavelength dependent transmission,
noticeable in the infra-red due to water vapour and carbon dioxide.
The correction of these effects is to compare the source with another
having a well-behaved and understood spectral shape <em> i.e. viz.</em> a
standard source.
<P>
In general, the flux density from an astronomical source, <em>S</em>,
and the flux density of a standard, <em>R</em>,
will suffer attenuation and diminution by atmospheric transmission,
<I>T</I>, and the instrumental response, <I>I</I>. The measured
signals for each type of source will be proportional to the products of
the three terms. Early type A stars are known to
approximate very well to black body sources and so, for a star of known spectral type
and luminosity class, the spectrum can be re-created using the black body flux density,
<I>B</I>, of the standard at some effective temperature: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I> Spectrum = BSTI / RTI </I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
where all terms on the right-hand side are functions of wavelength.
This must be
proportional to the product of flux density of the standard and some term which is
dependent only upon the arbitrary brightness, <em>k</em>, of the
`ratio-ing' source thus:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I> Spectrum = kS </I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It can be seen that dividing by a standard star in this way removes
atmospheric absorption features from the spectrum. This depends upon the
path length through which both source and standard are measured. To remain
true both must be observed at, or close to, the same airmass.
<P>
The first equation contains the key. Standard stars are observed in
exactly the same way as other astronomical objects. They are sky
subtracted into reduced group files, although a reduced observation can be
filed as a standard if desired.  Converting an observation to a standard
involves Portable-CGS4DR extracting a 1-D spectrum, generating a
normalised (model) black body, dividing the spectrum by this model black
body and growing the result along the slit. It is filed in the index file
as a frame beginning with `st' and stored in $RGDIR/.
<P>
When the time comes to ratio a source, Portable-CGS4DR will select a
standard based upon pre-determined criteria and divide the observation to
be calibrated by it and, hence, re-create the spectrum. The output file
has the label _dbs appended to it and is simply the ratio of the DN/exp
in the source divided by the DN/exp in the standard <em> i.e.</em> no account
is taken of exposure times.
