<H1>Reducing an Object, Sky or Arc</H1>
<P>
To reduce an OBJECT, SKY or ARC, Portable-CGS4DR reads
the raw data from store in $idir/ and FITS header information
from store in $odir/, applies a bad pixel mask, optionally
subtracts a reduced BIAS frame, linearises the data (if required),
optionally subtracts a reduced DARK, optionally divides by a flat
field and wavelength calibrates the data (if required), and writes the
reduced data parameters into the index file and stores the reduced OBJECT, 
SKY or ARC in $rodir/ as shown in figure 3.0.
<P>
Note that if the bad pixel mask is changed between the calibration frame
and the astronomical data, the resultant quality array will contain the
logical AND of the two masks until the calibration data is
re-reduced with the new mask and the RED4 task is re-initialised to
force it to memory map the new calibration frame. This has caused some
confusion in the past.
