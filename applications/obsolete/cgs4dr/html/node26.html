<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>
This section describes the ICL command line interface to
Portable-CGS4DR now available under all Unix platforms supported by
Starlink. Significant modifications to the task structures were made
during the porting process (Daly 1995) but every attempt has been made to achieve the
same `look and feel' as the older software.
<P>
The command line interface offers a limited subset of the previous 
functionality for two reasons:
<P>
<UL><LI> CGS4 data reduction is not well suited to a command line interface
      and some users may find the software rather `kludgey'. 
      Writing the scripts to give the full functionality required is a 
      tiresome process and little effort is available to do it.
<LI> Limited time was available for testing the software so only the key 
      elements of the data reduction were tested. That does not mean that the
      other aspects of CGS4 data reduction do not work merely that they have
      not been tested. If you do try the more advanced features of Portable-CGS4DR,
      please let me know how you get on.
