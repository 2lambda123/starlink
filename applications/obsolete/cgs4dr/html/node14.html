<P>
After BIAS subtraction, the signal from the detector array may be
corrected for non-linearity by modifying it with a suitable polynomial of
the form:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I> S(x) = Ax + Bx<SUP>2</SUP> + Cx<SUP>3</SUP> + Dx<SUP>4</SUP> + Ex<SUP>5</SUP></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
where <em>x</em> is the measured signal and <em>S(x)</em> is proportional to the light
intensity falling on the detector. These coefficients may determined
manually by examining FLAT fields taken at different exposure times
as the software does not contain any automated way of doing this. Such
coefficients are specified in ASCII text in a linearization file:

<P>
Note that this means that all pixels are calibrated with the same
polynomial. The file type must be .dat and it is stored in the directory
$CGS4_MASKS/. Note that, although every effort has been made to
avoid arithmetic errors during linearization, floating point overflows can
occur if the coefficients are set to ridiculous values. The higher order
terms, in particular, should be <b>&lt;&lt;</b> 1.00 to avoid such problems.
<P>
For the arrays used in CGS4, no measurable non-linearity has been found to
within 98% of full well. For these reasons, this facility is normally
turned off by setting the value to #.
