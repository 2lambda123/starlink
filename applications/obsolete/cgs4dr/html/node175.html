<H1>How Do I Read Old Index Files?</H1>
<P>
If you mean old index files generated under VMS, you can't. Under VMS the index file was maintained as an indexed sequential
access method (ISAM) file. These files were DEC Fortran compiler extensions and, as such,
were not portable between systems.
<P>
There is a similar problem under Unix: if you write an index file under, say, Solaris (as you do at UKIRT) then that file will 
<em>not</em> be readable under Digital Unix and vice-versa. You can re-create the index file (from the reduced observations)
by entering a series of `END oyymmdd_nnnn' commands into the queue using the `End Range' dialogue box in the Queue
Manager options menu.
