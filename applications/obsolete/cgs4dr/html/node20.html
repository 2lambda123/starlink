<H1>Sky Subtraction and the Propagation of Variance</H1>
<P>
There are two strategies for combining observations into groups depending
upon the value of the logical flag add_in_pairs. If TRUE the
reduction routines combine reduced observations belonging to a particular
group into pairs of observations. Each pair must consist of one
observation of type OBJECT and one of type SKY. Other
combinations are not allowed.
<P>
If an observation is the first of the pair, it is simply remembered until
next time around. If it is the second observation, the SKY member of
the pair may be multiplied by a weighting factor indicated by the sky_wt
parameter before being subtracted from the OBJECT member, and the
result co-added to the group. Pairs of observations may also be weighted
according to their variance.
<P>
The variance, <I>V</I>, in the group may be propagated by combining together the
variances contained in the individual (<em>m</em>) reduced observations comprising 
the group according to the familiar variance rule (Bevington 1969):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I> V&#178;<SUB>grp(n)</SUB> = V&#178;<SUB>obs(n)</SUB> + 
V&#178;<SUB>obs(n+1)</SUB> + V&#178;<SUB>obs(n+2)</SUB> + ... + 
V&#178;<SUB>obs(n+m-1)</SUB> + V&#178;<SUB>obs(n+m)</SUB></I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This scheme is called propagation of errors FROM_INT.
If these are poorly determined, we can estimate the standard error, <I>S</I>,
in the variation between the pairs of reduced observations when they are
co-added into the group according to the formula:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I> S&#178; = V&#178; / n = { (x<SUB>1</SUB>&#178; + x<SUB>2</SUB>&#178; + ... + x<SUB>n</SUB>&#178; ) - 
(x<SUB>1</SUB> + x<SUB>2</SUB> + ... + x<SUB>n</SUB> )&#178;/n } / n(n - 1) </I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This scheme is called propagation of errors FROM_OBS 
and is necessary if the observations consist of only one
exposure per integration and one detector scan, and therefore contain no
error information themselves.
<P>
It is important to grasp that variance weighting of errors can only be
used when the errors are already determined. It makes no sense, therefore,
to enable variance weighting and attempt to propagate errors using the
FROM_OBS regime.
<P>
Indeed, at the present time, although the data reduction provides both
methods for error propagation <em> i.e. viz.</em> FROM_INT and FROM_OBS, the user is advised to default to FROM_OBS as, aside from
the aforementioned caveat, a bug exists somewhere in the FROM_INT code that has never been traced. For completeness, however,
both are documented here.
<P>
If add_in_pairs is FALSE, the routines apply a reduced observation
belonging to a particular group to a reduced group file.  Reduced
observations of type OBJECT are added to the contents of the reduced
group file whilst reduced observations of type SKY are subtracted
from the contents of the reduced group file, after being optionally
multiplied by a weighting factor indicated by the sky_wt parameter. 
Observations may also be weighted according to their variance if observing
conditions dictate. Observation types other than OBJECT and SKY are not allowed.
<P>
You might well ask, then, what is the difference between add_in_pairs
set to FALSE as opposed to TRUE since both appear to produce
sky subtracted reduced groups?
<P>
First, if an equal number of OBJECT and SKY observations are
taken, the running mean should be calculated using the number of pairs of
observations, rather than the total number of observations, or the mean
signal calculated will be a factor of 2 smaller than it should be. The
signal will be calculated correctly for a series of OBJECT
observations with no SKYs.
<P>
Second, if there are unequal numbers of bad pixels at a given location
from the SKY and OBJECT observations, that particular point
will not be sky-subtracted properly.
<P>
Third, the variance weighting algorithm will work properly only for a
series of consecutive OBJECT observations. If both OBJECT and
SKY observations are reduced, different weights may be applied to
OBJECT and SKY, and the data will not be properly
sky-subtracted.
<P>
For these reasons, it is better to add such observations in pairs <em>
i.e.</em> with add_in_pairs set to TRUE.
<P>
This is only part of the story, however, as CGS4 can take data in several
modes the two most common of which are CHOP and STARE.  For
CHOP mode sky subtraction, phase A - B is calculated within the
acquisition electronics and groups are formed as a sum of objects. If
chopping and nodding are enabled then OBJECT-SKY pairs are formed
as for STARE mode (essentially already described above but, of
course, there should be an equal number of OBJECT and SKY
frames taken during the acquisition phase).
<P>
Note that when observations are combined into reduced groups, a running
average is maintained, with hooks built in for first and second
observations so that a sensible mean and variance are generated, broadly
according to the formula:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I> D<SUB>grp</SUB> = { nD<SUB>grp</SUB> + (D<SUB>obj</SUB> - D<SUB>sky</SUB> ) } / n + 1 </I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
where <I>D<SUB>item</SUB></I> is the data value for group, 
object and sky (as appropriate) and <em>n</em> is
the number of coadds. Some observers have noted that coadding many sky
subtracted frames into reduced groups (<em> i.e.</em> <em> n &gt; 50 </em>) slows the data reduction down by a significant factor and have attributed this to
re-averaging the whole stack. That is incorrect. The probable cause of the
slow down is the many FITS items and Portable-CGS4DR specific
structures that must be included in the reduced group as part of the
reduction. Extending such structures is, unfortunately, a costly process.
