Preliminary reduction of array data is common to both spectroscopy and
photometry and techniques describing the removal of instrumental
effects are noted elsewhere (Daly 1987). Before starting to use
Portable-CGS4DR, however, you should be familiar with the reduction of
spectroscopic data (Puxley 1988).  It would also be advantageous to be
familiar with Figaro data reduction (Bailey 1990, Bailey 1991).
Portable-CGS4DR software knows about the following observation types:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL ><DT>BIAS
<DD>- A short blank observation.
<DT>DARK
<DD>- Blank observation with the same on-chip exposure time as 
 another observation.
<DT>FLAT
<DD>- Observation of black-body source in calibration unit, 
 the sky or the illuminated dome.
<DT>OBJECT
<DD>- Observation of an astronomical object.
<DT>SKY
<DD>- Observation to subtract from an OBJECT frame to 
 perform first order sky subtraction. 
<DT>ARC
<DD>- Uncalibrated observation of the arc lamp or OH-lines from
 the sky. 
<DT>CALIBR
<DD>- An ARC observation converted into a wavelength 
 calibrated frame.
<DT>STANDARD
<DD>- A standard star observation divided by a model 
 black-body.

In a common data reduction sequence the following operations would be
carried out:
<P>
<OL><LI> Apply a bad pixel mask.
<LI> Subtract a BIAS frame.
<LI> Linearise the signal.
<LI> Subtract a DARK frame.
<LI> Divide by a FLAT field.
<LI> Interlace integrations taken at different detector positions.
<LI> Calibrate x-axis into wavelength.
<LI> Co-add observations and subtract SKY frames.
<LI> Divide by a STANDARD source.
<LI> Extract up to 3 spectra nodded along the slit.
</OL>
<P>
These steps are configurable to allow for a wide variety of astronomical
configurations. When observations are reduced they are recorded in an
index file of the form CGS4_yymmdd.INDEX, where <em>
yyddmm</em> is the UT date on which the observations were made, in the
directory $cgs4_index/. The system will try to replace the date
string with an appropriate value whenever possible based upon universal
time. The contents of the index file may also be manipulated.
