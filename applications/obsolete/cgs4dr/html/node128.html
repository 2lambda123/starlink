<H1>Common Problems Upon Startup</H1>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <i> /star/bin/cgs4dr/tcl/cgs4dr_tcl: Command not found.</i>
<P>
  The awish program has not been found.
<P>
  By default, awish is installed in /star/bin/awish and this is reflected
  in the first line of the file $CGS4DR_ROOT/tcl/cgs4dr_tcl:
  <PRE>  #!/star/bin/awish -file </PRE>
  If awish has been installed elsewhere, this line will need editing to reflect 
  the correct location.
<P>
<LI> <i> Invalid command name "adamtask".</i>
<P>
  The ADAM extensions to tcl are not readable.
<P>
  The STARTCL software specifies a series of extensions to tcl that allow
  communications with the ADAM messaging system and, hence, the tasks. These
  extensions are held in some directory in a file called adamtask.tcl (and others).
  The GUI startup file $CGS4DR_ROOT/tcl/cgs4dr_tcl has a line thus:
  <PRE>  set tclAdamLib /star/lib/tk/adam </PRE>
  This needs to reflect the location of your site's copy of the STARTCL software.
<P>
<LI> <i> cgs4dr_tcl aborting, failed creating task rendezvous file: File exists.</i>
<P>
  Task redezvous files were not deleted by previous shutdown.
<P>
  The task rendezvous files are located in the directory $HOME/adam and have the generic form 
  <i>xxxx</i>_<em>task</em>_<i>yyyy</i> where <i>xxxx</i> and <i>yyyy</i> are unique numbers
  and <em>task</em> is one of the Portable-CGS4DR tasks (cred4, red4, p4, qman and, possibly, ukirtfig).
  There are also files called cgs4dr_tcl_relay_<i>zzzz</i> and the like where <i>zzzz</i>
  is another unique identifier. These are the task rendezvous files. If the software is, 
  for example, aborted (using % kill -9 <em>something</em>) rather than shutdown, these files may not be deleted.
  Subsequent attempts to run the software will fail until these rendezvous files are
  deleted. A list of current rendezvous files can be created thus:
<P>
  <PRE>  % ls -l ~/adam | grep 'p---' </PRE>
<P>
  Note that if you run the software more than once, some files are created with names such as
  `cgs4dr_tcl #2_xxxx'. The quotes are deliberate as the filename contains a space character
  which is completely legal under Unix. Such files must be deleted properly.
<P>
<LI> <i> grab failed: another application has grab while executing "grab $QmanWidgets(INTERRUPT)".</i>
<P>
  Tcl/tk can't grab the widget defining the interrupt.
<P>
  This occurs when another version of the queue manager task is running or a previous incantation was
  not shut down properly. The solution is to run the cgs4dr_kill script before re-invoking the software.
<P>
<LI> <i>parameter prompt box appears.</i>
<P>
  The parameter prompt box shown, for example, in figure 11.4 appears.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=CENTER SRC="cgs4drParams.gif"><P>
Figure 11.4: The Paramter Prompt Box</CENTER>
<P>
  This is a result of file corruption probably in the ADAM parameter file. There are two solutions.
  The easier, and preferred, solution is to shut the software down using the commands in the section 
  <A HREF="node178.html">How Do I Start from Scratch?</A>. If you wish to persevere, though, the parameter
  prompt box appears due to character items having a missing end-quote as shown in the figure. You can
  always just add the end-quote (or delete the start-quote) and click on OK for each item.
<P>
<LI> <i> Unable to allocate colour cells.</i>
<P>
  Software could not allocate enough colour cells.
<P>
  The number of colour cells is finite. Running too many (colour) applications (such as
  netscape, xmosaic etc) can exhaust the number of colour cells resulting in a failure
  to load the GUI. If this happens, you must delete some applications.
<P>
<LI> <i> adamnet failed to bind socket: Address already in use <br>
         adamnet: bad initialisation status = 141525083</i>
<P>
 This only happens at UKIRT where distributed ADAMnet communications are required
 between the VAX data acquisition and Unix data reduction systems. This happens because
 another user left ADAMnet running. The solution is to login as a privileged user and do:
<P>
  <PRE>  % kill -9 `ps -ef | grep adamnet | grep -v grep | nawk '{print $2}'` </PRE>
