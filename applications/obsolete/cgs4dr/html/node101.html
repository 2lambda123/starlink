<H1>The Plotting Task</H1>
<P>
P4 is the generic plotting package. The lower
layers of the software call PGPLOT routines and access to the data is via
Figaro's DSA library. Thus P4 can handle either NDF or DST files
and plots to any Starlink supported graphics device for which a PGPLOT driver
is available.
<P>
A noticeboard is maintained in memory describing the attributes of the available 
display surfaces, plotting devices open on each surface and some aspects of the data.
This noticeboard can be manipulated directly by the user giving a wide-variety
of options to tailor the display. Indeed, some users may find the range of 
options too broad and confusing.
<P>
Although the package is quite generic and may be invoked separately from other
items of software, it still retains some intelligence regarding CGS4 data and directory structures.
<P>
P4 can plot data as an image, a graph, an overgraph (over-laid graph upon
a previous graph), a surface, a histogram or a contour map (with several
algorithms to determine contour levels). Nearly seventy colour (look-up) tables are
shipped with the software that should cater to most tastes.
P4 also generates labels and titles from the contents of the data-file or
as specified by the user.
<P>
Any number of users may run P4 concurrently. Each viewport (0 - 8)
may have a separate plot device defined but a PGPLOT restriction is that only one may be
open at any one time. Thus using multiple devices on different viewports may
slow the software down.
