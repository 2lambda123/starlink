<H1>Invoking Dynamic Defaults and On-line Help</H1><P>
The generic mouse supplied with workstations has three buttons labelled
left-to-right as MB1, MB2 and MB3. The Portable-CGS4DR style is to use
all three buttons:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
MB1 - Single Click - Invoke an action or dialogue box or similar <br>
MB1 - Double Click - Invoke an action or dialogue box from a listbox widget <br>
MB2 - Single Click - Invoke a dynamic default value <br>
MB2 - Double Click - Reset a text entry widget to a null string (empty) <br>
MB3 - Single Click - Invoke on-line help <br>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In listboxes, the primary selection of text is made using a single click with MB1.
This <em>must</em> be done prior to using MB3 for on-line help. Failure to do so will 
either invoke the help text associated with the current selected item (which is 
likely to be different from the one you want) or return the error dialogue box
shown in figure 11.2 which says that no listbox item is currently selected.

<P>
Also note that some in-line images may have an incorrect label (within the
image). This is to save space as several functions use the same type of dialogue
box and the displayed widgets are very similar to those shown.
<P>
Dynamic defaulting has been enabled, where appropriate, using MB2. The following
scheme has been enabled: using MB2 within any particular data input widget will set the
dynamic default for just that widget whereas using MB2 on any text label within
that widget tree sets all defaults within that tree.
<P>
As an example, the CRED4 setup button invokes a dialogue box with the various
data reduction sequences offerred via a series of radiobuttons. Using MB2
within any horizontal level of radiobuttons will set just that value to some
sensible default. If, however, you position the mouse over any text label
(such as `Subtract BIAS Frame?', `Subtract DARK Frame?' etc), the all of the
displayed values will be set to sensible defaults when MB2 is depressed.
