<H1>Introduction to Tcl/tk</H1>
<P>
Tcl/tk (Ousterhout, 1994) stands for the `tool command language/toolkit'.
It was written by John Ousterhout of the University of California in
response to the continual development of ad-hoc interfaces to different
projects. What was needed was a generic command language that could be
modified to suit the user's needs <em> i.e.</em> it had to be <em>
extensible</em>. Thus tcl was born. The addition of the toolkit at a later
stage made tcl/tk a very powerful GUI prototyping environment available
with little effort and, perhaps more importantly, at no cost to the
community.
<P>
In September 1993, the ADAM V Workshop provided demonstrations of two
proposed GUIs for Starlink development: Xadam (based upon tcl/tk's expect
command) and ICLmenus (an in-house solution). GUI-builders were ruled out
at any early stage. In October 1994, at the Baltimore ADASS IV meeting, it
was clear that tcl/tk was taking the astronomical world by storm (as, for
example, had xmosaic a year or so earlier). Starlink had implemented some
extensions to tcl to allow the system to communicate with ADAM tasks.
Later work done at ROE provided tcl extensions to communicate with NBS.
Together these systems formed what is now known as STARTCL (Terrett, 1995)
and it is this product that is the basis for the Portable-CGS4DR graphical
user interface.

GUI stands for graphical user interface. Personally, I prefer the term
`pictorial interface' as it gets the idea across must quicker. In a GUI
there are graphical (pictorial) elements such as pull-down menus, action
buttons, radiobuttons, checkbuttons, slide bars, scroll bars, text panes
and the like. All of these elements are generically termed `widgets' and
they can be ordered into hierarchies called widget trees. GUIs are also
capable of providing colourful interfaces and usually require a mouse to
interact with the system. Advanced GUIs have <em> keyboard traveral</em> so
that a keyboard can be used for input when a mouse is not available.
