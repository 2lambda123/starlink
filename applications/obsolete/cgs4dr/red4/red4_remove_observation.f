*+  RED4_REMOVE_OBSERVATION - Subtract an observation from a reduced group file
      SUBROUTINE RED4_REMOVE_OBSERVATION( STATUS )
*    Description :
*     This routine removes a reduced observation belonging to a particular 
*     group from a reduced group file, provided that observation has
*     previously been co-added. It is assumed that reduced observations
*     of type OBJECT were added to the contents of the reduced group 
*     file, and reduced observations of type SKY were subtracted from the
*     contents of the reduced group file, after being optionally 
*     multiplied by a weighting factor indicated by the SKY_WT parameter.
*     Observations may also have been weighted according to their variance
*     if observing conditions dictate.
*     Observation types other than OBJECT and SKY are not allowed.
*
*     The COADDS structure in the reduced group file corresponding to
*     the given observation is deleted.
*
*     Note that it is not possible to reverse the changes to the FITS
*     header that were made when the observation was added. The exposure
*     time is removed from the EXPOSED or SKYEXP parameters, but the
*     previous values of RUTSTART, RUTEND, UTSTART, UTEND, AMSTART and
*     AMEND cannot be restored.
*    Invocation :
*     CALL RED4_REMOVE_OBSERVATION( STATUS )
*    Parameters :
*     STATUS  = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*           Global ADAM status
*    Method :
*    Deficiencies :
*     As stated in "Description", it is not possible to reverse the
*     changes made to the FITS header by the addition of the observation
*     being removed by this routine.

*    History :
*     31-Oct-1990: Original version, based on RED4_ADD_OBSERVATION.(SMB)
*      1-Nov-1990: VARIANCE_WT and SKY_WT parameters obtained.     (SMB)
*     24-Feb-1991: Some error reporting mistakes fixed,
*                  which would have made this routine
*                  fail under ADAM V1.9.                           (SMB)
*     23-Feb-1993: Conform to error strategy                       (PND)
