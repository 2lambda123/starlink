*+ RED4_NORMALISE_FIT - Normalise 2-D spectrum by polynomial fitting
      SUBROUTINE RED4_NORMALISE_FIT( NPIX, NLINE, ORDER, DATA,
     :  VARIANCE, QUALITY, SPECTRUM, SUM, X, Y, STATUS )
*    Description :
*     This normalises a 2-D spectrum (usually a flat-field) and removes
*     any large-scale changes with wavelength by applying the following
*     procedure :-
*
*     1. The 2-D spectrum is collapsed in Y to an average 1-D spectrum.
*     2. A polynomial is fitted to the 1-D spectrum, in log space.
*     3. Each row of the 2-D spectrum is divided by this polynomial.
*     4. Errors are also divided by this polynomial.
*
*     The routine will also zero any area of the data which is assigned
*     a bad quality.
*
*     It is assumed that wavelength increases monotonically with column
*     number on the 2-D array.
*
*     The routine is based on the Figaro routine FIG_FLAT2D, which
*     normalises a flat field and uses it to flatten a 2-D spectrum.
*     It uses the same Figaro routines, FITLPOLY and LPOLY, as used
*     by FIG_FLAT2D.
*    Invocation :
*      CALL RED4_NORMALISE_FIT( NPIX, NLINE, ORDER, DATA,
*     :  VARIANCE, QUALITY, SPECTRUM, SUM, X, Y, STATUS )
*    Parameters :
*     NPIX                = INTEGER( READ )
*           x-dimension of data
*     NLINE               = INTEGER( READ )
*           y-dimension of data
*     ORDER               = INTEGER( READ )
*           order for polynomial fit to profile.
*           Only values in the range 1-7 are allowed.
*     DATA( NPIX, NLINE ) = REAL( UPDATE )
*           2-D (flat field) data to be normalised.
*           This array is overwritten in situ.
*     VARIANCE( NPIX, NLINE ) = REAL( UPDATE )
*           The variance of the 2-D data (to be processed 
*           simultateously).
*     QUALITY( NPIX, NLINE )  = BYTE( UPDATE )
*           The quality array associated with the input data.
*           (0 is assumed to mean "good").
*     SPECTRUM( NPIX )    = REAL( WRITE )
*           work area to hold fitted profile.
*           On exit this will contain the fitted profile.
*     SUM( NPIX )         = INTEGER( WRITE )
*           Work area to hold the number of items summed.
*     X( NPIX )           = REAL( WRITE )
*           work area for profile fit
*     Y( NPIX )           = REAL( WRITE )
*           work area for profile fit
*     STATUS              = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*           Global status
*    Method :
*    Deficiencies :
*     The routine may return an array with an average value 
*     significantly greater than 1.0 if many if the data values
*     end up being below <fracmin> of the fitted polynomial.
*     This is because the data are normalised to the fit.
*     This routine may have to be rewritten if the Figaro functions
*     used are changed drastically.
