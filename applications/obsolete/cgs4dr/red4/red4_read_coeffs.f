*+  RED4_READ_COEFFS - Read linearisation coefficients from a file.
      SUBROUTINE RED4_READ_COEFFS( FILE, MAXCOEFFS, NCOEFFS, COEFFS, 
     :  STATUS )
*    Description :
*     This routine reads the linearisation coefficients from the
*     given text file. Any number of coefficients can be included
*     in the file, up to a maximum of MAXCOEFFS. The coefficients
*     should be arranged one per line in the file as follows:
*        Coefficient of X
*        Coefficient of X**2
*        Coefficient of X**3
*        Coefficient of X**4
*        etc...
*     If a directory specification is not given, the file will be
*     assumed to be in the CGS4_MASKS directory.
*     Comments lines can be included at the beginning of the file
*     preceded by "!" characters.
*    Invocation :
*     CALL RED4_READ_COEFFS( FILE, MAXCOEFFS, NCOEFFS, COEFFS, STATUS )
*    Parameters :
*     FILE                = CHARACTER*(*)( READ )
*           The name of the file to be opened.
*     MAXCOEFFS           = INTEGER( READ )
*           The maximum number of coefficients allowed.
*     NCOEFFS             = INTEGER( WRITE )
*           The actual number of coefficients read
*     COEFFS( MAXCOEFFS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION( WRITE )
*           The coefficients read from the file.
*     STATUS        = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*           Global status. This must be ADAM__OK on entry.
*           If this routine completes successfully, the STATUS
*           will be ADAM__OK on exit. Any other value indicates
*           an error.
