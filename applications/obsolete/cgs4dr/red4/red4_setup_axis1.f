      SUBROUTINE RED4_SETUP_AXIS1 (AXIS1, INDEX, AXIS1_DIM, 
     :   DCOLUMNS, DETINCR, DETNINCR, GLAMBDA, GDISP, STATUS)
*    Description :
*     This routine sets up the X axis array for a data set which is
*     oversampled in the X direction. An INDEX array is also filled with
*     a look-up table indicating how pixels in the individual
*     integrations at each detector position map onto pixels in the main
*     data set. The X axis array may be filled with pixel co-ordinates
*     or wavelength values according to the values of GLAMBDA and GDISP.
*    Invocation :
*     CALL RED4_SETUP_AXIS1 (AXIS1, INDEX, AXIS1_DIM, DCOLUMNS, DETINCR, 
*    :   DETNINCR, GLAMBDA, GDISP, STATUS)
*    Parameters :
*     AXIS1( AXIS1_DIM )               = DOUBLE PRECISION( WRITE )
*           The X axis array to be set up.
*     INDEX( DCOLUMNS, DETNINCR )      = INTEGER( WRITE )
*           Index array containing a look-up table to convert integration
*           element + detector position into observation element.
*     RANK( AXIS1_DIM )                = INTEGER( WRITE )
*           A work array to hold ordering information.
*     AXIS1_DIM                        = INTEGER( READ )
*           Dimension of the AXIS1 array.
*     DCOLUMNS                         = INTEGER( READ )
*           The number of columns on the detector.
*     DETINCR                          = REAL( READ )
*           The co-ordinate increment required per step in pixels
*           (normally 1.0/NUMBER_STEPS, but can have other values)
*     DETNINCR                         = INTEGER( READ )
*           The number of detector positions (i.e. the oversampling 
*           factor).
*     GLAMBDA                          = REAL( READ )
*           The wavelength corresponding to pixel co-ordinate 31.0.
*           (If this parameter is set to 31.0, the axis1 array will
*           be filled with pixel co-ordinates).
*     GDISP                            = REAL( READ )
*           The wavelength increment per increment of 1.0 in the
*           pixel co-ordinate.
*           (If this parameter is set to 1.0, the axis1 array will
*           be filled with pixel co-ordinates).
*     STATUS                           = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*           Global status
*    Method :
*    Deficiencies :
*     The Starlink convention on the labelling of axes, described in 
*     SSN/22, states that the left hand side of the first bin should
*     be labelled 0.0.
*     However, the Figaro convention, described in the Figaro user guide,
*     states that the left hand side of the first bin should be 0.5.
*     This routine now uses the Figaro convention.
*
*     It would probably have been better if the setting up of the AXIS1
*     and INDEX arrays had been done in separate routines.

*    History :
*           1989?: Original version.                                   (JFL)
*      9-Nov-1990: Source code and NAG manual examined, to determine
*                  what this routine does! Description, Parameters,
*                  Method, Deficiencies and History sections added.
*                  Source comments improved and code spaced out. Checks
*                  on the value of IFAIL returned by the NAG routines
*                  added. "REAL*8" changed to "DOUBLE PRECISION". POS_1
*                  declared DOUBLE PRECISION for consistency.          (SMB)
*      9-Nov-1990: Tentatively modified so that the axis is labelled
*                  according to the Figaro co-ordinate convention.     (SMB)
*     21-Nov-1990: GLAMBDA and GDISP parameters added, so this routine
*                  can also be used to fill the axis1 array with 
*                  wavelength values. This same routine is used because
*                  it is necessary to call it to fill the index array
*                  anyway.                                             (SMB)
*     22-Feb-1991: Loading up the X axis, using a NAG routine to sort
*                  it and produce a RANK array, which then magically
*                  contains exactly the right numbers for the INDEX
*                  array, is not only obscure, but totally incompatible
*                  with "supersampling" (scanning the detector over
*                  more than one pixel to remove bad pixels). At last
*                  this is a good excuse to throw away the contents of
*                  this routine and start again from scratch !
*                  Completely rewritten (at summit - please check).   (SMB)
*     23-Feb-1991: Code checked. Some mistakes corrected.             (SMB)
*     23-Feb-1991: More mistakes corrected!                           (SMB)

*   Determine if "supersampling" is being used (i.e. scanning the 
*   detector over more than one pixel  to remove bad pixels).
*   For normal operation this will be 1. For scanning over N pixels
*   it will be N. (If DETNINCR is 1 there is no SUPERSAMPLING,
