*+  RED4_SUBTRACT_PAIR - Subtract OBJECT/SKY pair of observations from current group
      SUBROUTINE RED4_SUBTRACT_PAIR( DIM1, DIM2, SKYWT,
     :  OBJDATA, OBJQUAL, SKYDATA, SKYQUAL, DATA, VARIANCE, QUALITY, 
     :  COADDS, STATUS )
*    Description :
*     This subroutine subtracts a pair of OBJECT and SKY observations from
*     the current reduced group. Variances are calculated from the
*     spread of values co-added into the group. SKY observations are
*     weighted by the factor supplied in SKYWT.
*    Invocation :
*      CALL RED4_SUBTRACT_PAIR( DIM1, DIM2, SKYWT,
*     :  OBJDATA, OBJQUAL, SKYDATA, SKYQUAL, DATA, VARIANCE, QUALITY, 
*     :  COADDS, STATUS )
*    Parameters :
*     DIM1                             = INTEGER( READ )
*        First dimension of observation array
*     DIM2                             = INTEGER( READ )
*        Second dimension of observation array
*     SKYWT                            = REAL( READ )
*        Weighting to multiply SKY data by before subtracting.
*     OBJDATA( DIM1, DIM2 )            = REAL( READ )
*        OBJECT observation data array to be co-added.
*     OBJQUAL( DIM1, DIM2 )            = BYTE( READ )
*        OBJECT observation data quality array.
*     SKYDATA( DIM1, DIM2 )            = REAL( READ )
*        SKY observation data array to be co-added.
*     SKYQUAL( DIM1, DIM2 )            = BYTE( READ )
*        SKY observation data quality array.
*     DATA( DIM1, DIM2 )               = REAL( UPDATE )
*        The reduced group data array from which observations are to be
*        subtracted.
*     VARIANCE( DIM1, DIM2 )           = REAL( UPDATE )
*        The current variance of the reduced group array.
*     QUALITY( DIM1, DIM2 )            = BYTE( UPDATE )
*        The current data quality of the reduced group array.
*     COADDS( DATADIM1, DATADIM2 )     = WORD( UPDATE )
*        An array containing the number of observations which
*        have been co-added into each element of the reduced
*        group array. (NOTE: There are two observations per
*        pair, so the numbers within this array need to be
*        divided by 2 to make the number of pairs, which is
*        used in the calculations. This is done to be compatible
*        with RED4_COADD_OBS, where observations are co-added
*        one at a time).
*     STATUS                           = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*        Global status. It can be returned with the following values:
*        ADAM__OK    - Success.
*        SAI__WARN   - Variance weighting required, and the
*                      variance array in the group file contains
*                      one or more zeros.
*    Method :
*     The mean and variance are calculated by the method of moments,
*     as described in J.F.Kerry and E.S.Keeping, 1939. "Mathematics
*     of Statistics", Van Nostrand (see p.78). The population variance
*     is used and converted to "standard error squared".
*    Deficiencies :
*     Zero variance values are written when the variance cannot be
*     calculated. The preferred way of doing this (according to
*     Rodney Warren-Smith, Starlink) is to flag these points
*     with special "bad" (possibly negative) values in the
*     variance array. At the moment, negative values will cause DSA
*     to crash so zero is used. The value is defined in a parameter
*     which can be changed later when "bad" variance values are
*     supported.
