*+  RED4_LIST_INDEX - List the contents of the CGS4 index file.
      SUBROUTINE RED4_LIST_INDEX( STATUS )
*    Description :
*     This subroutine reads the observation index file and displays
*     its contents. The output may be directed to the screen or written
*     to a file, which may optionally be printed. The screen display may
*     be in one of two selected formats. 
*     Format 1 gives:
*      Observation, Quality, Type, Time, Exposure, Grating, Slit, CVF, Filters
*     Format 2 gives:
*      Observation, Quality, Type, Time, Mode, Group, Row,Col,Osmp, Cnfindex,
*      Airmass
*     Writing to disk combines both the above formats together.
*    Invocation :
*     CALL RED4_LIST_INDEX( STATUS )
*    Parameters :
*     STATUS   = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*         Global ADAM status.
*    Method :
*    Deficiencies :
*     The system IDATE routine does not distinguish between years
*     before or after the year 2000. A fudge is used which assumes
*     that year numbers greater than 50 are in the 20th century
*     and year numbers less than or equal to 50 are in the 21st
*     century. (Now that only 2 digit year numbers are used this
*     fudge is hidden anyway, but may reappear if the specification
*     were to change again ...).

*     P.N.Daly     (JACH::PND)
*    History :
*     11-Jul-1990: Original version.                            (SMB)
*     23-Jul-1990: Output format altered to allow 4 digit
*                  observation numbers. Also, INDDIR changed
*                  to CGS4_INDEX.                               (SMB)
*     30-Jul-1990: Modified to use 4 digits for the year
*                  number instead of 2, so the software will
*                  work correctly after the year 2000.          (SMB)
*     31-Jul-1990: Specification changed back to how it was !!!!
*                  Year number changed from 4 digits back to
*                  2. Modulo used instead of subtracting 1900,
*                  so the software will still work after the
*                  year 2000. Also modified to construct year
*                  code with I6.6 format.                        (SMB)
*      4-Sep-1990: ERR_OUT replaced with ERR_REP.                (SMB)
*     23-Oct-1990: Commented out code removed.                   (SMB)
*     19-Nov-1990: Index file format changed again to include
*                  parameters required for wavelength and flux
*                  calibration. Two output formats defined,
*                  because there are more parameters than can
*                  be displayed on one line.                     (SMB)
*     12-Dec-1990: Index file format changed again! This is because
*                  it is possible for different observations to be
*                  made in NDR mode with different effective detector
*                  sizes, and the calibration frames for these must
*                  not get mixed up. Format 2 made to include
*                  detector size.                                (SMB)
*     13-Dec-1990: Split into RED4_LIST_INDEX and
*                  RED4_LIST_INDEX_SCREEN.                       (SMB)
*     13-Dec-1990: Ability to send output to screen, file or
*                  printer added.                                (SMB)
*     22-Feb-1993: Conform to error strategy                     (PND)
*     28-Nov-1994: Portable version                              (AB)
