*+  RED4_SEEK_OBSERVATION - Look up a calibration observation from index file
      SUBROUTINE RED4_SEEK_OBSERVATION ( INDEX_FILE, OBSREF,
     :  TYPE_REQUIRED, SEARCH_MODE, OBS_MATCH, AMTOLER, OBS_NAME,
     :  STATUS)
*    Description :
*     This subroutine searches the observation cache and index for a reduced 
*     observation that will be of use in the reduction sequence of the
*     current integration/observation. For example the observation of
*     a star will need the results of BIAS, DARK, and FLAT
*     observations in its reduction sequence, each of these will be
*     selected using this routine. 
*
*     Currently the routine selects the suitable observation of the 
*     desired type that was taken closest in time to the observation
*     being reduced. The SEARCH_MODE argument controls whether 
*     this search is made to cover observations taken before the current 
*     observation (backwards search), after the current observation
*     (forwards search), or both. 'Suitability' depends on the type of the
*     desired observation, it may require many of the array exposure and
*     optical setup parameters to match those of the current observation.
*     Some of the matching criteria are compulsory, and others are optional
*     and selectable by parameter. The matching criteria are as follows:-

*     :  SEARCH_MODE, OBS_MATCH, AMTOLER, OBS_NAME, STATUS)
*    Parameters :
*    Method :
*    Deficiencies :
*     This code needs restructuring without GOTOs. It is also far more
*     complicated than it needs to be, and requires simplification.
*
*     DSA status values do not conform to the ADAM scheme. It has
*     therefore been necessary to trap these statuses before they
*     get translated into confusing messages like "exceeded quota".
*     The traps can be removed once DSA conforms.
*
*     Real values, such as the grating wavelength, are tested against
*     an absolute tolerance. A percentage difference test should
*     perhaps have been used instead (as is done with air mass).

*    History :
*     18-Dec-1989: Original version.                            (JFL)
*      4-Feb-1990: Changed to read observations into common     (JFL)
*      2-Mar-1990: SLIT_NUMBER changed to SLIT_NAME.            (SMB)
*      2-Mar-1990: CVF_STATE changed to CVF_NAME.               (SMB)
*     12-Mar-1990: Bug, in which wrong length obtained for
*                  OBSREC.SLIT_NAME, fixed. Status report
*                  included in error reports.  MAXDIM and
*                  IMAXDIM parameters included.                 (SMB)
*     23-Apr-1990: FLAT_FIELD changed to FLAT.                  (SMB)
*     23-Apr-1990: There is a very subtle bug in which,
*                  under some circumstances, DTA will write
*                  a different data structure to that which
*                  it has been told to create. I suspect
*                  this is a memory corruption problem. The
*                  problem seems to occur when a DARK
*                  observation is reduced after another one
*                  which has used the same BIAS. This routine
*                  is the prime candidate for the bug. Code
*                  checked and found to make use of some
*                  uninitialised variables. This fault
*                  corrected and code spaced out. Bug still
*                  not fixed, though. Error checking improved.
*                  Status checked after LIB$GET_LUN             (SMB)
*     23-Apr-1990: I/O errors were not being tested properly.
*                  "attempt to access non-existent record"
*                  errors should be treated as an end-of-file
*                  Relevant code included.                      (SMB)
*     24-Apr-1990: Because of memory corruption problems, the
*                  code needs to be compiled with array bounds
*                  checking switched on. The Figaro dynamic
*                  memory functions (DYN_ELEMENT, DYNAMIC_MEM,
*                  DYN_INCREMENT) would not allow this. Code
*                  modified to use %val() instead.              (SMB)
*     27-Apr-1990: The "memory corruption/DTA" bug does not
*                  occur if a DARK is reduced which requires
*                  a different BIAS. Try a fudge in which a
*                  new BIAS is always mapped for a DARK, to
*                  allow the system to be used while the real
*                  bug is hunted. The fudge worked.             (SMB)
*     27-Apr-1990: The GOTO structure was found to be incorrect.
*                  If an error occurred, the routine would
*                  attempt to close a file which hadn't been
*                  opened, and free a logical unit which had
*                  not been obtained. GOTOs corrected, but they
*                  should eventually be removed!!               (SMB)
*     27-Apr-1990: Fudge to get over "memory corruption/DTA"
*                  bug removed, so the code may be debugged.    (SMB)
*     27-Apr-1990: Close scrutiny of the code revealed more
*                  bugs. The check for TYPE_REQUIRED being
*                  invalid was made in the wrong place.
*                  Also, a typing mistake was found in which
*                  LIB$FREE_VM could free a different amount
*                  of virtual memory than that allocated by
*                  LIB$GET_VM. These bugs fixed. Substantially
*                  more comments added after consultation with
*                  JFL.                                         (SMB)
*     30-Apr-1990: Fudge to get around DTA/corruption bug now
*                  implemented permenantly, since
*                  investigations have failed to track the bug
*                  down. It is logged as an outstanding bug.   (SMB)
*      5-Jul-1990: Major changes: It has been decided that the
*                  requirement that flat fields should be taken
*                  with identical instrument settings be dropped,
*                  as flat fields can now be normalised to take
*                  out large scale variations with wavelength.
*                  Flat field index pointers and dimensions are
*                  therefore no longer needed, and have been
*                  removed from the common block and are no
*                  longer initialised by this routine. The
*                  contents of the index file remains the same
*                  "for historical reasons" to maintain
*                  compatibility with existing index files.
*                  Definition of OBSREC structure moved to
*                  include file. Commented out code removed.  (SMB)
*      9-Jul-1990: It has now been decided that this routine
*                  should insist that a flat-field has the
*                  same grating name, grating order, slit name,
*                  slit angle, cvf name and filters, but not
*                  exposure time. This is because these parameters
*                  may affect the instrument vigneting along the
*                  slit, which cannot be removed by normnalisation.
*                  The grating order and slit angle checks should
*                  be commented out for the time being so as not
*                  to frustrate the engineering checks. Original
*                  code modified so that checks for equality
*                  between REAL values are not made.          (SMB)
*      9-Jul-1990: Modified so the reasons for rejecting
*                  an observation are given.                  (SMB)
*     12-Jul-1990: Routine checked to ensure all character
*                  strings are converted to upper case before
*                  comparison. Discovered SLIT_NAME was not
*                  being converted - fixed.                   (SMB)
*     12-Jul-1990: Fudge added for engineering checks. ANY
*                  flat-field will be accepted.               (SMB)
*     12-Jul-1990: Fudge removed. As it is likely that the
*                  items which need to be matched for a
*                  suitable flat-field will vary during
*                  future engineering tests, these items are
*                  now obtained via a parameter, FLAT_MATCH,
*                  which is defaulted in the interface file.  (SMB)
*     20-Jul-1990: Messages about DARK and FLAT frames having
*                  "incorrect" settings was confusing. Changed
*                  to "non-matching".                         (SMB)
*     23-Jul-1990: Character handling improved by using utility
*                  routines to convert between file names, and
*                  modified to accept 4 digit observation numbers. (SMB)
*     23-Jul-1990: INDDIR changed to CGS4_INDEX.                   (SMB)
*     24-Jul-1990: Mistake fixed. The change to the format of the
*                  index file has also changed its KEY positions.  (SMB)
*     28-Aug-1990: Phase 1 of major changes: Header
*                  information in the observation and reduced
*                  observation files is now written in a .FITS
*                  structure. Linearisation coefficients are
*                  now obtained from a file rather than being
*                  buried in the data structure. KTC mode
*                  replaced by NDR.                                (SMB)
*      3-Sep-1990: Phase 2 of major changes: Header
*                  information in the integration and reduced
*                  integration files is now written in a .FITS
*                  structure.                                      (SMB)
*      4-Sep-1990: ERR_OUT replaced with ERR_REP.                  (SMB)
*      6-Sep-1990: I think the DTA cache bug has been fixed. Code
*                  uncommented tentatively. Also modified to check
*                  the NORMALIS item in the FITS structure to find
*                  out if a FLAT has been normalised.              (SMB)
*      7-Sep-1990: All output commented out, as it was too verbose.(SMB)
*      2-Oct-1990: Made to open index file READONLY.               (SMB)
*     23-Oct-1990: Commented out code removed.                     (SMB)
*     19-Nov-1990: Index file format changed again to include
*                  parameters required for wavelength and flux
*                  calibration. Ability to search for CALIBRATION
*                  observation added. Quantity of output controlled
*                  by VERBOSE flag. "Non-matching" replaced by
*                  the more grammatical "different"                (SMB)
*     21-Nov-1990: INTREF replaced by INDEX_FILE, to try and make
*                  this routine more general-purpose. As a side
*                  effect of this, the end time is now obtained
*                  from the OBSERVATION file and not the
*                  INTEGRATION file.                               (SMB)
*     21-Nov-1990: Mistake correction: A CALIBRATION observation
*                  does not have to be opened and mapped.          (SMB)
*     29-Nov-1990: MAXDIM moved to RED4_COMMON.INC                 (SMB)
*     12-Dec-1990: Index file format changed again! This is because
*                  it is possible for different observations to be
*                  made in NDR mode with different effective detector
*                  sizes, and the calibration frames for these must
*                  not get mixed up. Description improved.
*                  Bug fix. The TIME will no longer wrap at 24.0,
*                  so remove the midnight adjustment.              (SMB)
*     18-Dec-1990: Typing mistakes fixed.                          (SMB)
*     17-Jan-1991: END_TIME replaced by START_TIME.                (SMB)
*      7-Feb-1991: Bug in calculation of mean air mass fixed.      (SMB)
*      8-Feb-1991: Observation mode (integration type) matched for
*                  DARK observations.                              (SMB)
*     24-Feb-1991: Some error reporting mistakes fixed, which would
*                  have made this routine fail under ADAM V1.9.    (SMB)
*     24-Feb-1991: DSA error statuses trapped, as these do
*                  not conform to the ADAM error scheme.           (SMB)
*     27-Feb-1991: Match tolerance reduced slightly. (It would
*                  probably be better if real values were matched
*                  by percentage, as with air mass).               (SMB)
*     20-May-1991: Fix bug with GLAMBDA which was being compared
*                  with GANGLE                                     (PND)
*      7-Oct-1991: Major change to incorporate DRIMP/5.1 and 5.2.
*                  Parts of this routine have been transferred to
*                  RED4_GET_OBSERVATION, which now calls this
*                  routine. Ability to search either forwards or
