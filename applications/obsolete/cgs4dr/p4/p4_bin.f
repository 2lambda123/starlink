*+  P4_BIN - Determine frequency distribution withing 2-D array subset
      SUBROUTINE P4_BIN( XDIM, YDIM, IN, QUAL, QUALITY, I1, I2, IINC,
     :  J1, J2, JINC, LOW, HIGH, SMOOTH, NBINS, XBIN, FREQ, WORK,
     :  TOOSMALL, TOOLARGE, FMIN, FMAX, MODE, STATUS ) 
*    Description :
*     This routine takes a subset of a 2-D array, delimited by
*     I1, I2, J1, and J2 in steps of IINC and JINC, and determines the
*     frequencies of the data values in NBINS bins between the values
*     LOW and HIGH. If a data value is found exactly on the boundary
*     between two bins it is assigned to the higher bin. The frequency
*     array may optionally be smoothed with a moving box filter, to
*     remove noise spikes which may affect the mode.
*     This routine is used when preparing a histogram of the data.
*    Invocation :
*      CALL P4_BIN( XDIM, YDIM, IN, QUAL, QUALITY, I1, I2, IINC, J1, J2,
*     :  JINC, LOW, HIGH, SMOOTH, NBINS, XBIN, FREQ, WORK, TOOSMALL,
*     :  TOOLARGE, FMIN, FMAX, MODE, STATUS )
*    Parameters :
