      SUBROUTINE CAP_GINIT (STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAP_GINIT 
*  Purpose:
*     Initialise the catview common blocks on startup.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAP_GINIT (STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Initialise the catview common blocks on startup.
*
*     Note that this routine is called before any catalogue is opened.
*  Arguments:
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Set the 'catalogue open' flag to false.
*     Initialise the screen details.
*     Initialise the output text file details.
*     Initialise the flag to say that the details of the set of
*     components have changed.
*     Initialise the flag to determine whether any units attributes
*     recognised as angles are to be reformatted prior to display to
*     indicate that they are.
*     Initialise the scatterplot common block.
