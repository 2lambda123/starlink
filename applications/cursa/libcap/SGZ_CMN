*
*    Details of the catalogue.

      LOGICAL COPEN__SGZ  ! Flag indicating a catalogue has been opened.

      CHARACTER CNAME__SGZ*(CAT__SZCNF)  ! Catalogue name.

      INTEGER CI__SGZ                    ! Catalogue identifier.

*
*    Components to be listed.  Here the components may be either
*    columns, parameters or expressions.

      INTEGER CMPS__SGZ             ! Number of components.

      CHARACTER
     :  CMPNM__SGZ(SGZ__MXCMP)*(CAT__SZEXP)  ! Component names.

      INTEGER
     :  CMPID__SGZ(SGZ__MXCMP)      ! Component identifiers.

*
*    Flag indicating whether any of the details of the set of components
*    to be listed may have changed.  It is coded as follows:
*    .TRUE.   -  the details may have changed,
*    .FALSE.  -  the details have not changed.

      LOGICAL CMPCG__SGZ

*
*    Components for which statistics are to be computed.  Here the
*    components must be columns.

      INTEGER SCPS__SGZ             ! Number of components.

      CHARACTER
     :  SCPNM__SGZ(SGZ__MXCMP)*(CAT__SZEXP)  ! Component names.

      INTEGER
     :  SCPID__SGZ(SGZ__MXCMP)      ! Component identifiers.

*
*    Number of decimal places with which the column statistics will be
*    displayed.

      INTEGER
     :  SDCPL__SGZ

*
*    Selections created.

      INTEGER SELS__SGZ             ! Number of selections.

      CHARACTER CRIT__SGZ(SGZ__MXSEL)*(CAT__SZEXP) ! Selection criteria.

      INTEGER
     :  SELID__SGZ(SGZ__MXSEL),     ! Selection identifiers.
     :  SELBS__SGZ(SGZ__MXSEL),     ! Base selection of each selection.
     :  SELRW__SGZ(SGZ__MXSEL)      ! No. of rows in each selection.

*
*    Current selection.

      INTEGER CSEL__SGZ

*
*    Number of the current row in the current selection.

      INTEGER CROW__SGZ

*
*    Is the application being driven from a GUI.

      LOGICAL GUI__SGZ

*
*    Screen details.

      INTEGER
     :  SWID__SGZ,           ! Screen width.
     :  SHT__SGZ             ! Screen height.

*
*    The number of spaces to reserved in a screen listing for a running
*    sequence number.  A value of zero implies that a sequence number is
*    not required.

      INTEGER RUN__SGZ

*
*    Number of rows to be listed by a single invocation of action LIST.

      INTEGER NLIST__SGZ

*
*    Flag determining whether a UNITS attribute is recognised as describing
*    a column of angles is displayed unaltered or reformatted prior to
*    display.  If it is reformatted then the contents of the attribute
*    are replaced (for display only) by either the sexagesimal format
*    specifier (extracted from the attribute) or the string 'Radians',
*    depending on whether or not angles are currently being output as
*    sexagesimal values or radians.  The values are:
*    .TRUE.  -  reformat the UNITS attribute,
*    .FALSE. -  do not reformat the UNITS attribute.

      LOGICAL ANGRF__SGZ

*
*    Variables holding details for the output text file.

      LOGICAL
     :  FPRNT__SGZ   ! Flag: is the file a print file?
      INTEGER
     :  FSUMM__SGZ,  ! Flag: level of detail for summary listing.
