      SUBROUTINE CAP_GSCNF (SWID, SHT, SEQNO, NLIST, ANGRPN, ANGRF,
     :  GUI, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CAP_GSCNF
*  Purpose:
*     Set the screen configuration.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAP_GSCNF (SWID, SHT, SEQNO, NLIST, ANGRPN, ANGRF, GUI;
*       STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Set the screen configuration.
*  Arguments:
*     SWID  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Screen width in characters.
*     SHT  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Screen height in characters.
*     SEQNO  =  LOGICAL (Given)
*        Flag indicating whether listed rows are preceeded by a running
*        sequence number, coded as follows:
*        .TRUE.  - include a sequence number,
*        .FALSE. - do not include a sequence number.
*     NLIST  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lines to display in a single invocation of action
*        'LIST'.
*     ANGRPN  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Flag indicating whether columns of angles are to be displayed
*        as hours or degrees formatted as sexagesimal values or as
*        radians.  The permitted values are:
*        'RADIANS'     -  output angles in radians,
*        'SEXAGESIMAL' -  output angles in hours or degrees, formatted
*           as sexagesimal values.
*     ANGRF  =  LOGICAL (Given)
*        Flag determining whether a UNITS attribute is recognised as
*        describing a column of angles is displayed unaltered or
*        reformatted prior to display.  If it is reformatted then the
*        contents of the attribute are replaced (for display only) by
*        either the sexagesimal format specifier (extracted from the
*        attribute) or the string 'Radians', depending on whether or not
*        angles are currently being output as sexagesimal values or
*        radians.  The values are:
*        .TRUE.  -  reformat the UNITS attribute,
*        .FALSE. -  do not reformat the UNITS attribute.
*     GUI  =  LOGICAL (Given)
*        Flag indicating whether or not the application is being
*        driven from a GUI.  It is coded as follows:
*        .TRUE.  -  driven from a GUI,
*        .FALSE. -  driven from the command line.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Set the screen width if the given value lies in the permitted
*     range.
*     Set the screen height.
*     If the catalogue is open then
*       If each row is to be preceded by a sequence number then
*         Get the number of rows in the catalogue.
*         Compute the width required to hold the sequence number.
*       else
*         Set the width for the sequence number to zero.
*       end if
*    else
*      Set the width for the sequence number to zero.
*    end if
*    Set the number of lines to be displayed by 'LIST'.
*    Set the external representation of columns of angles.
*    Set the flag determining whether a UNITS attribute is recognised as
*    describing a column of angles is displayed unaltered or
*    reformatted.
*    Set the GUI flag.
*    Set the flag saying that the details of the set of components
*    have changed.
