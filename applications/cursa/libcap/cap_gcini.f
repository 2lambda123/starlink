*+
*  Name:
*     CAP_GCINI 
*  Purpose:
*     Initialise StarGaze for a new catalogue.
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CAP_GCINI (CNAME, CI; STATUS)
*  Description:
*     Initialise StarGaze for a new catalogue.
*  Arguments:
*     CNAME  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Name of the catalogue.
*     CI  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Catalogue identifier.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*  Algorithm:
*     Set the catalogue name and identifier.
*     Set the number of selections to one.
*     Set the first selection to be the entire catalogue.
*     Set the current selection to be the first selection.
*     Set the current row to 1.
