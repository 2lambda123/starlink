#  History:
#     26-MAY-1995 (BLY):
#       Version for CURSA v1.0
#     14-OCT-1995 (ACD):
#       Added aliases for application catgscin (which is new in
#       release 1.1).
#     20-DEC-1996 (ACD):
#       Added aliases for application catselect (which is new in
#       release 2.1).
#     13-JUN-1997 (ACD):
#       Added aliases for applications catcoord, catchart, catchartrn
#       and catremote (which are new in release 3.1).  Also set
#       environment variable SKYCAT_CONFIG so that the default set
#       of remote catalogues is the copy of the HEASARC at Leicester.
#     13-NOV-1997 (ACD):
#       Added aliases for applications catphotomfit, catphotomtrn
#       and catphotomlst (which are new in release 4.1).

#       Added aliases for application (Perl script) catremote.
#     {enter_changes_here}
#     29-NOV-1999 (ACD):
#       Added aliases for application catgrid.  Corrected the URL for
#       the default configuration file.
#     31-MAY-2001 (ACD):
#       Modified to correspond to the new catremote which is a Perl script
#       rather than a C++ program.

#  Prepare to run ADAM applications if this has not been done already.
#  ===================================================================
#
#  Here look to see if there is an ADAM_USER directory.  If there is not
#  check whether or not there is an adam file that is not a directory.
#  If there is, issue a warning and exit.  Otherwise create the required
#  directory.
#
if (-d ${HOME}/adam) then
   echo -n
else
   if (-f ${HOME}/adam) then
      echo "You have a file called adam in your home directory.  Please rename "

      exit
   else

#
#  Define aliases for the applications.
#  There should be a plain alias, and a package specific alias
#  so thatapplications that have conflicting command names are
#  still available.

#  Environment variables for catremote.
#  ===================================
#
#  Define the utility program to be used to submit the query.  The options
#  are:
#    "/star/bin/cursa/geturl" -- geturl utility, 
#    "lynx -source"           -- lynx command line browser,
#    "java  UrlReader"        -- Java utility.
#    "wget -q -O -"           -- wget utility (probably RedHat Linux only).

setenv  CATREM_URLREADER @bindir@/geturl

#
#  Specify the configuration file to be used.  The URL given here is the
#  the CURSA default.

setenv  CATREM_CONFIG  http://harris.roe.ac.uk/~acd/catremote/cursa.cfg

#
#  Define the maximum number of objects which may be included in the
#  returned table.

setenv  CATREM_MAXOBJ  200

#
#  Specify whether the URL constituting the query is echoed to the
#  command line.  The options re:
#    no   -  do not echo the URL (default),
#    yes  -  echo the URL.

setenv  CATREM_ECHOURL no

#
#  Set the Java CLASSPATH environment variable to pick up the URLreader
#  (note that CLASSPATH has to be set rather than setting the corresponding
#  command line option because the latter does not work on alphas).

setenv CLASSPATH @bindir@:/usr/lib/netscape/java/classes


#
#  Announce the availability of the CURSA commands.

echo ""
echo "   CURSA commands are now available -- (Version @PACKAGE_VERSION@)"
