! STL for PISA results file.
!
! This STL header describes a PISA results file, containing
! parameterised details for objects detected in a 2D image frame.
!
! See SUN/109 for further details of the PISA column definitions and
! SUN/190 for further details of the STL format.

C INDEX     INTEGER 1             ! Index number (running count).
C XPOS      REAL    2 EXFMT=F9.3  ! Central X position (pixels).
C YPOS      REAL    3 EXFMT=F9.3  ! Central Y position (pixels).
C INTENSITY REAL    4 EXFMT=F9.0  ! Integrated intensity.
C NPIX      INTEGER 5             ! Number of pixels above the threshold.
C PEAK      REAL    6 EXFMT=F9.0  ! Peak intensity in one pixel.
C ELLIPT    REAL    7 EXFMT=F6.3  ! Ellipticity.
C ANGLE     REAL    8 EXFMT=F6.1  ! Orientation, anti-clockwise from y-axis.
C SXX       REAL    9 EXFMT=E10.3 ! Second moment in X.
C SYY       REAL   10 EXFMT=E10.3 ! Second moment in Y.
C SXY       REAL   11 EXFMT=E10.3 ! Cross moment in X and Y.

! To access a given PISA results file either:
!
! (a) Change the following FILE specification by replacing pisafind.dat
!     with the name of the required results file, as appropriate (but
!     remember to leave the file name enclosed in single quotes,
!
! (b) or comment out or delete the FILE specification and un-comment the
!     BEGINTABLE line and append the contents of the results file to follow
!     this line.  Note that the table of results must follow the BEGINTABLE
!     line immediately, without intervening blank lines.
