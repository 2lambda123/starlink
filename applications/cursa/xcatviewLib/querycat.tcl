#
#  Set variables to hold the name of the catalogue to be queried
#  (usno@eso) and the details of the region to be searched (the area
#  within 10 minutes of arc of Right Ascension 12:15:00, Declination
#  30:30:00 (J2000)).

    set remoteQueryCat    "usno@eso"
    set remoteQueryRA     "12:15:00"
    set remoteQueryDec    "30:30:00"
    set remoteQueryRadius "10"

#  Set the remote server to one which includes the catalogue usno@eso.

#  Attempt to execute catremote to submit the query and proceed if ok.
#  The output is written to temporary file QUERY_RESULT.

#
#     Read back the output written to temporary file QUERY_RESULT and
#     copy it to standard output.  Reading continues until an empty
#     line is encountered.
#
#     If the query succeeded a single line will be returned which includes
#     the name of the catalogue of retrieved objects, whereas a failed
#     query will return a different message.  A typical application might
#     parse the line to check for success or failure and obtain the catalogue 
#     name in the case of success, eg. so that the catalogue can be opened.
#     In this example the line is parsed and simple messages written.
