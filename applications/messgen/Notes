messgen autoconfed and added to CVS repository by Norman Gray, on
2003 December 8

Actions: Created simple bootstrap, configure.ac and Makefile.am;
filled in component.xml.  Added cremsg.c, messgen.c and sun185.tex to
repository.  Added generated Makefile.in and configure as usual.
Added test file sai_err.msg, and news file messgen.news to repository,
though neither is (at present) used.
