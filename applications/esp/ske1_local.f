      SUBROUTINE SKE1_LOCAL(MULT,ELEMS,ARRAY,RADIUS, 
     :                  XMAX,YMAX,STATUS,ARRAY2)    
*+
*  Name: 
*     SKE1_LOCAL

*  Purpose:
*     Performs skewness calculations for a circular symmetrical
*     template of known width. The mode value used is the average pixel
*     value found within the template.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SKE1_LOCAL(MULT,ELEMS,%VAL(POINT1(1)),RADIUS,MODE,
*                      XMAX,YMAX,STATUS,%VAL(POINT2(1)))  
      
*  Description:
*     Given a source image, the routine generates an equivalent image of
*     similar size that shows, at each pixel, the degree of skewness
*     that was present in the circular area around the equivalent point
*     in the source image. Skewness should normally be near zero for
*     a Gaussian (Normal) distribution. Large deviations from this 
*     suggest regions either containing objects or flatfielding flaws.
*
*     The calculation is carried out as follows:
*
*     The value for each pixel of the output image is determined 
*     as follows. An imaginary circle is drawn about the pixel
*     and the count values for all pixels within that circle, 
*     are stored. 
*
*     The count values are then used to calculate the skewness using 
*     a local mode value.
 
*  Arguments:
*     MULT = REAL (Given)
*        The multiplying value applied to all the skewness values
*        generated.
*     ELEMS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in the image.
*     ARRAY(ELEMS) = REAL (Given)
*        The array containing the source NDF image count values.
*     RADIUS = REAL (Given)
*        The radius of the circular template that is used to define
*        the region about a given pixel, that might contribute to the 
*        skewness value that will be inserted into
*        the equivalent pixel in ARRAY2.
*     MODE = REAL (Given)
*        The global mode value supplied by the user. Units counts.
*     XMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of the image x axis. Units pixels.
*     YMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of the y axis of the image. Units pixels.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned) 
*        The global status.     
*     ARRAY2(ELEMS) = REAL (Returned)
*        The array that eventually contains the skewness 'image'.
