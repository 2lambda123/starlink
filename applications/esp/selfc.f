      SUBROUTINE SELFC( STATUS )             
*+
*  Name:
*     SELFC

*  Purpose:
*     To perform self-correlations on an NDF image file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SELFC( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER(Given and Returned)
*     The global status.

*  Description:
*     Performs a self-correlation calculation on an input NDF image 
*     file. The resulting correlation image/plot is stored to disk.
*
*     The self-correlated image may be used to find flat-fielding 
*     faults and faint diffuse objects of a given size.
*
*     To reduce the influence of bright objects or cosmic rays;
*     the user may elect to employ a cut out pixel count value where 
*     any pixel found to be above that value is ignored. The cutout
*     value is determined by the user inputting a global mode value 
*     (usually the sky background count - obtained via HISTPEAK), 
*     the background count standard deviation and the number of standard  
*     deviations above sky level at which the cutout should occur.
*
*     The user is required to enter a value for the size of object(s) 
*     of interest (roughly the template size) and also the image pixel 
*     size.
*
*     The value for each pixel of the output image is determined 
*     as follows. An imaginary circle is drawn about the pixel
*     and all pixel pairs within that circle, that lie on opposite
*     sides of the centre from each other, are stored. 
*
*     Each pair is then considered in turn and the modal count value
*     subtracted from each. The resultant residual pixel count values 
*     are then multiplied together. The values found for all the pairs 
*     are then summed, the total divided by the number of pixel pairs 
*     found and the square root taken. In the event of a negative sum 
*     being found the value given is the square root of the magnitude 
*     of the self-correlation multiplied by -1.
*
*     The resultant value is some measure of the extent to
*     which points within that circle (about the current pixel)
*     are correlated. 
*
*     The method assumes some sort of symmetry is present in the 
*     objects detected but appears to work well on a wide range of 
*     image types.
*
*     A border is present in the output image which the same width
*     as the radius of the template. All pixels within this border
*     are assigned the value bad.
*

*  Usage:
*     SELFC IN OUT DIAM PSIZE BACK USEALL [SIGMA] [NSIGMA]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BACK = _REAL (Read)
*        The modal pixel count value found in the input NDF.
*        Units counts.
*     DIAM = _REAL (Read)
*        The diameter of the galaxies to be searched for in the
*        image. Units arc seconds.
*     IN = _NDF (Read)
*        The name of the NDF data that is to be examined.
*     NSIGMA = _REAL(Read)
*        The number of standard deviations above the sky level
*        count value, where the pixel count cutoff occurs. 
*     OUT = _NDF (Write)
*        The name of the NDF that will be created. 
*     PSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The size of each pixel in arc seconds.  If the image contains
*        a SKY co-ordinate frame this value will be determined 
*        automatically.
*     SIGMA = _REAL (Read)
*        The standard deviation of the background count within the 
*        input NDF. Should be determined using a routine such as
*        HISTPEAK which ignores outliers. 
*     USEALL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Used to indicate whether a pixel count threshold is to
*        be a applied when calculating the self-correlation.

*  Examples:
*     selfc in=search out=scorr diam=15. psize=0.5 back=727. 
*           useall=true
*        A self-correlation is carried out on image GALAXIES. The 
*        search is for an object 15 arc seconds across. The image 
*        pixel size is .5 arc seconds and the background count level 
*        is 727. USEALL=TRUE ensures that no pixels are excluded from 
*        the correlation calculation.     
*
*     selfc in=plate out=plates diam=5. back=6600. 
*           useall=false sigma=35. nsigma=5.
*        A self-correlation is carried out on image PLATE. The search
*        is for an object 5 arc seconds across.  The background count
*        level is 6600 and the image pixel size in arc seconds will 
*        be determined from a SKY coordinate frame in the image's WCS
*        component if possible.  Since USEALL=FALSE, all pixels with 
*        a count value above 6600+35.x5. are excluded from the 
*        correlation calculation.  The output image is named PLATES.

*  Implementation Status:
*     At present suitable normalisation factors have not been 
*     implemented. These may be added. As the program stands it is 
*     useful for looking at an image to detect faint objects and 
*     provides a comparison for users employing cross-correlation 
*     techniques. In addition, it provides a simple way of detecting 
*     areas of an image where flatfielding has not been entirely 
*     successful.
