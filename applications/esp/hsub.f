      SUBROUTINE HSUB( STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     HSUB
*
*  Purpose:
*     A subroutine version of HISTPEAK for developers.
*
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL HSUB( STATUS )
*
*  Arguments:   
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
*
*  Description: 
*     A subroutine version of HISTPEAK that has been designed to be
*     easily transplanted into the users ADAM programs. It establishes 
*     the mode, median and other statistics for NDF image files. Calls a 
*     subroutine based upon a modified version of HISTPEAK to obtain 
*     values for the mode, skewness and kurtosis values for an NDF image.
*
*     The method employed to calculate the modal value from the 
*     count versus frequency histogram is user selected using
*     parameter TYPE.
*
*     The histogram may also be smoothed using a Normal distribution 
*     filter of integer radius SFACT. In general, values less than 3 
*     have very little effect. A value of 0 indicates no smoothing is to
*     be employed. 
* 
*  Usage:
*     HSUB IN SFACT TYPE OUT OUTCAT
*
*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IN = _NDF (Read)
*        The name of the NDF data structure/file that is to be 
*        examined.
*     SFACT = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The Gaussian smoothing filter radius requested. This may be:
*        - -1 to indicate that the application should automatically
*          assign a filter radius to apply to the histogram.
*        - 0 to indicate that the histogram should not be smoothed.
*        - >0 to indicate the radius of the Gaussian filter to use. 
*        Values greater than HSB__SFLIM (see include file HSUB_PAR)
*        are not allowed. The value returned is that actually  
*        employed. Units counts.
*     TYPE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Allows the user to define which method is to be used to 
*        calculate the modal count value.
*        1 = raw histogram
*        2 = smoothed histogram
*        3 = extrapolate the length of chords through histogram peak
*            to zero length
*        4 = interpolation of data points near the histogram peak
*        0 = computer selection i.e. the highest method number that
*            didnt fail
*        A negative value is returned if the application cannot supply a
*        result using the method requested. The value returned for 
*        mode is the next best estimate.
*     OUT = _CHAR (Read)
*        The name of an output file which is to receive the results.  If
*        not present, then the results are printed on stdout.
*     OUTCAT = _CHAR (Read)
*        The name of a file which is to receive the results formatted as
*        an STL file, as defined in SUN/190.  Both OUT and OUTCAT may be
*        specified, in which case output is sent to both.  If neither
*        is specified, then output is sent to stdout, in the format
*        appropriate for the OUT parameter.  OUTCAT may only be
*        specified on the command line.
*
*  Examples:
*     hsub in=ic3374 sfact=0 type=0
*
*        A histogram of the values in image IC3374 is constructed. 
*        The image is not smoothed (SFACT=0) and the results returned
*        correspond to the highest value (1-4) of TYPE that was 
*        obtainable.
*
*     hsub in=galaxy sfact=10 type=4
*
*        A histogram of the values in image GALAXY is used. The image 
*        is smoothed (SFACT=10) using a Gaussian filter of radius 10. 
*        The results required are those for the smoothed histogram 
*        only.
*
*     hsub in=forn4 sfact=6 type=3 outcat=hsub.txt
*
*        A histogram of the values in image FORN4 is used. The image 
*        is smoothed using a gaussian filter of radius 6 and the 
*        results returned those for the projected mode value.
*
*  Implementation Status:
*     The current version will not accept a pixel value range greater 
*     than the largest integer value possible. 
*
*  Notes: 
*     HSUB should be viewed as a coding example for users wishing
*     to incorporate the functions of HISTPEAK into their own 
*     programs.
*
*     This application is intended to form the basis of a user 
*     program requiring image statistics. The user requiring other
*     data from the application will need to modify subroutines HSUB
*     and HISTPEA2 so that the desired parameters (say mean or median)
*     are passed between them.
*
*     With the addition of the OUTCAT keyword, HSUB is now used by GAIA
*     to generate backgrounds, so it is not merely an example.  It is
*     still, of course, useful as an example of how to use the HISTPEAK
*     functions.  Specifically, you should not change the keywords in
*     the STL output.

*        set to -1. If all the methods (up to and including the method
*        required) fail then TYPE returns as -2.

*        3 = extrapolation to zero length of chords through histogram peak
*        4 = interpolation of smoothed histogram

*        The best modal count value estimate. Units counts.

*     NUPOI = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of non-bad pixels used. Units pixels.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description: 
*     Allows the user to input the name of an NDF image file and 
*     then constructs an image count value versus occurence histogram.
*     This is used to allow count median, mode, kurtosis, standard 
*     deviation, background standard deviation and skewness values to be estimated. 
*
*     It is assumed that all ARD file manipulation has already been 
*     carried out by the calling subroutine.
*
*     Bad valued points are excluded from the calculations.
*
*     Four estimates of the modal value are generated:
*     - unsmoothed mode.
*     - smoothed mode.
*     - projected mode. Calculated by extrapolating the lengths of a 
*       series of chords through the peak to zero length and determining
*       the count value at which this occurs.
*     - interpolated mode. Calculated by assuming a Normal form 
*       for the histogram peak and 'fitting' a function to it.
*       The function is then used to provide both a modal value and
*       the background standard deviation.  
*    
*     The value of greatest probable accuracy is returned to the calling
*     subroutine.
*     
*     Both the standard deviation of pixel count values and the background
*     count standard deviation value are generated:
*
*     The value standard deviation value is returned if the standard deviation value
*     was not calculated.

*  Implementation Status:
*     The current version will not accept a pixel value range greater 
*     than the largest integer value possible. This will be corrected 
*     in a later version.
