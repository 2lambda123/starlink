*
*   This module contains a call to the non-linear solving routine NSG, as
*   contained in module dnsg.f.
*
*   It has the same calling sequence as gau1_pro, as it is intended
*   to be a drop-in replacement.
*
*   Below, I will use the term NSG (as in `NSG's working arrays', or `the
*   data as seen by NSG') to refer both to the algorithm as
*   expressed in the routine gau2_drnsg and the module dnsg.f, and
*   to the supporting parts of the algorithm contained in the
*   harness below.  This is true even though we're using DRNSG
*   (double-precision, reverse-communication, NSG), and the module
*   dnsg.f actually contains all the code for NSF as well.  References
*   to page or section numbers in `NSG' are to the `Usage Summary for
*   Selected Optimization Routines', in the file port-usage.ps.  The
*   detailed documentation of the routines is in port3doc.tar.gz,
*   available where PORT is (http://www.bell-labs.com/project/PORT/ is
*   the master).
*
*   Where there is any conflict between the variable names as used in
*   gaufit and gau2_pro, and the variable names as used in the NSG
*   documentation (ie, two names for the same object), I have used the
*   latter here, to make matching this module with its documentation
*   easier.  The conflicts are:
*
*      gaufit | NSG    | meaning
*     --------+--------+-------------------------------------------
*      upix   |  n     | number of good pixels/data points
*      nsour  |  l     | number of gaussians/linear parameters
*     5*nsour |  p     | 5 per gaussian/number of non-linear params
*
*
*   Bugs:
*     None I'm aware of at present.
*
*   Deficiencies:
*
*     We calculate the uncertainties on the fitted parameters by
*     square-rooting the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix
*     produced by NSG.  It would probably be useful to examine the
*     off-diagonal elements and produce some sort of goodness-of-fit
*     diagnostic based on those, but I don't know how to do that at
*     present.  Similarly, is there anything we could do with the
*     `regression diagnostic'?  NSG's covariance calculation makes two
*     assumptions about the observational errors (see gau2_xerrs below):
*     these seem to be borne out, but it would be good to check.
*     Finally, fully half the number of function evaluations in NSG are
*     for the calculation of the covariance matrix: should I support a
*     no-errors mode which omits these with consequent speedup?
*
*     NSG doesn't appear to produce uncertainties on the linear
*     parameters.  Is this an NSG limitation (surely not!), or something
*     I can easily supply myself?
*
*     Development wrinkles: gau1_texto doesn't deal with passerrs;
*     gau1_fmode hasn't been altered at all; gau2_* still have writes;
*     make sure to restrict the output gaussian angle to +/- pi,
*     worrying about what this will do to the corresponding error.

*  Name:
*     GAU2_PRO
*
*  Purpose:
*     Determines the optimal parameters to fit NSOUR model gaussians to
*     the image data.
*
*  Language:
*     Fortran 77
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL GAU2_PRO(NSOUR,MODTYP,
*                   ANGCON,ANGOFF,PSIZE,NITER,
*                   RLIM,BACK,SIGMA,
*                   ELEMS,UPIX,POINT,PRANGE,GUESS,GUESSERRS,
*                   STATUS)
*
*  Description:
*     The routine is an interface to the routine gau2_nlfit below, which
*     handles the interaction with the NSG routines taken from the
*     public-domain part of the PORT library, and incorporated into
*     dnsg.F
*
*  Arguments:
*     In general, the arguments here have the same meanings as in
*      gau1_pro, but with some omissions.
*
*     NSOUR = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of sources.
*     MODTYP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Type of output image.  If it's gau2whole
*        image of the complete model, if gau2residual, create the image and
*        subtract it from the residuals.  If gau2regdiag, get NSG to
*        calculate the regression diagnostic and put it in here.
*        The image goes into point(3).
*     ANGCON = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Angle rotation convention. Defines if clockwise or
*        anticlockwise is considered positive. TRUE=Clockwise.  NOT YET USED!
*     ANGOFF = REAL (Given)
*        Angular offset for position angles generated. Units degrees.
*       NOT YET USED!
*     PSIZE = REAL (Given)
*        Pixel size for display.  Units arcsec
*     NITER = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of iterations.  Negative means use default 150.
*     RLIM(gau2maxfits) = REAL (Given)
*        The maximum distance from the origin at which profiling
*        takes place.
*     BACK = REAL (Given, and possibly returned)
*        The background count for the image.  If negative, this is to be
*        fitted for, rather than given as input.
*     SIGMA = REAL (Given and returned)
*        Standard deviation value of BACK (ignored if back<0).  In fact,
*        the input value of this is _always_ ignored in this version, as
*        the calculation of the covariance matrix assumes a value based
*        on the size of the residual, and it is this value which is
*        returned on completion (see the NSG documentation and notes
*        below in gau2_xerrs).
*     ELEMS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of elements/pixels in the image array. Units pixels.
*     UPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of non-masked pixels
*     POINT(6) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointers to the image arrays.
*     PRANGE(2) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Length of the X and Y axes of the image. Units pixels.  NOT YET USED!
*     GUESS(gau2maxfits,7) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Current parameter estimates.  Also returns best-fit estimates
*        of parameters.
*     GUESSERRS(gau2maxfits,7) = REAL (Returned)
*        Standard deviations of the corresponding parameters in guess
*     CALCERRS = REAL (given)
*        Should this routine calculate errors on GUESS()?
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
