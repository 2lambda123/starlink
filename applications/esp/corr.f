      SUBROUTINE CORR( STATUS )             
*+
*  Name:
*     CORR

*  Purpose:
*     Performs cross-correlations on an image using a galaxy template.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CORR( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER(Given and Returned)
*     The global status.

*  Description:
*     Performs calculations to cross-correlate a circular shaped 
*     exponential template with an image. 
*     The exponential profile template chosen optimises the chances of 
*     identifying faint diffuse galaxies/galaxies of (and near) a 
*     scale length defined by the user.
*
*     Performs cross-correlation calculations on an input NDF image 
*     file. The resulting image/plot is stored in an output NDF.
*
*     For each image pixel in turn, all the pixels within a defined
*     radius are identified. The values for each of these in turn have 
*     their background values subtracted and the result (F1)
*     multiplied by a factor (F2) generated using an exponential function. 
*     The values obtained for all the surrounding image pixels are 
*     summed. The total generated is divided by using a normalisation
*     value created by taking the sums of square for F1 and F2, 
*     multiplying them together and then taking the square root.
*     This normalised sum is placed in the 
*     appropriate pixel of the output image and the program moves on 
*     to the next input image pixel to be considered.
*
*     The circular elliptical mask used is of a radius 1.8x the
*     scale length requested. Studies undertaken by Phillipps and 
*     Davies at Cardiff suggest that this value optimises the 
*     detection sensitivity.
*
*     The correlation value obtained is multiplied by 1000 (or a user 
*     defined value) to make display easier.
*
*     A border is present in the final output image which is the
*     same width as the radius of the template used. Pixels within the 
*     border have been assigned the value bad.

*  Usage:
*     CORR IN OUT SCALE PSIZE BACK USEALL MULT [SIGMA] [NSIGMA]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BACK = _REAL (Read)
*        The modal pixel count value found in the input NDF.
*        Units counts.
*     IN = _NDF (Read)
*        The name of the NDF image that is to be examined.
*     MULT = _REAL (Read)
*        A multiplying factor applied to each of the results.
*        Default value is 1000.
*     NSIGMA = _REAL(Read)
*        The number of standard deviations above the sky level
*        count value, where the pixel count cutoff occurs. 
*     OUT = _NDF (Write)
*        The name of the NDF data that will be created. 
*     PSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The size of each image pixel. Units arc seconds.
*     SCALE = _REAL (Read)
*        The scale length of the galaxies to be highlighted in the 
*        output image. Units arc seconds.
*     SIGMA = _REAL (Read)
*        The standard deviations of the background pixel count within the 
*        input NDF. Should be determined using a routine such as
*        HISTPEAK which ignores outliers. 
*     USEALL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Used to indicate whether a pixel count threshold is to
*        be a applied when calculating the correlation.

*  Examples:
*     corr in=hh1826 out=correl scale=8. psize=0.3 back=7437.
*          useall=true mult=1000.
*
*       Correlates image HH1826 with a mask/template optimised for 
*       galaxies of 8 arc seconds scale length. The pixel size on the 
*       image is .3 arc second, the background count value 7437 and 
*       all the pixels on the image can be used in the calculation. 
*       The output image is to be named CORREL.  
*
*     corr in=forn out=forn4 scale=4. psize=0.22 mult=1000. back=666
*          useall=false sigma=15 nsigma=3
*
*       Correlates image FORN with a mask/template optimised for
*       galaxies of 4 arc seconds scale length. The pixel size is .22
*       arc seconds and the background count value 666.
*
*       Pixels that are brighter than 666+15x3 counts are not 
*       included in the correlation calculations (USEALL=FALSE). 
*       The output image is to be named FORN4.

*  Notes:
*     It is assumed that the x and y axis pixels are of the same size.
* 
*     To establish the statistical significance of a detection, this 
*     application should be used in conjunction with MIXUP to allow noise 
*     equivalent images to be generated and correlated thereby 
*     establishing a 3 sigma limit.

*  Name: 
*     COR1_CORR

*  Purpose:
*     Performs correlation calculations for a circular symmetrical
*     template of known diameter. It assumes a global mode value.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COR1_CORR(MULT,ELEMS,%VAL(POINT1(1)),RADIUS,MODE,

*  Description:
*     Given a source image, the routine generates an equivalent image of
*     similar size that shows, at each pixel, the degree of correlation
*     that was present in the circular area around the equivalent point
*     in the source image. Correlation should normally be near zero for
*     a Gaussian (Normal) distribution. Large deviations from this 
*     suggest regions either containing objects.
*
*     The calculation is carried out as follows:
*
*     The value for each pixel of the output image is determined 
*     as follows. An imaginary circle is drawn about the pixel
*     and the count values for all pixels within that circle, 
*     are stored. 
*
*     The values then have the background value subtracted and are
*     multiplied by an elliptical factor depending on the distance of
*     pixel from the resident pixel. 
*
*     The template size is set as 1.8x the size of the galaxy to be detected.
*     This is the optimal size.
*
*     The individual contributions from all the pixels within the user defined
*     radius are summed and then divided by the number found (non-bad) to
*     normalise the result. 

*  Arguments:
*     MULT = REAL (Given)
*        The multiplying value applied to all the correlation values.
*     ELEMS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in the image.
*     ARRAY(ELEMS) = REAL (Given)
*        The array containing the source NDF image count values.
*     RADIUS = REAL (Given)
*        The radius of the circular template that is used to define
*        the region about a given pixel, that might contribute to the 
*        correlation value that will be inserted into
*        the equivalent pixel in ARRAY2.
*     MODE = REAL (Given)
*        The global mode value supplied by the user. Units counts.
*     XMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of the image x axis. Units pixels.
*     YMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of the y axis of the image. Units pixels.
*     USEALL = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Flag indicating whether or not pixels of too high a value will be
*        ignored.
*     HIEST = REAL (Given)
*        The highest pixel count value that will be used in the analysis.
*        All pixels with count values above this will be ignored. Units 
*        counts.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned) 
*        The global status.     
*     ARRAY2(ELEMS) = REAL (Returned)
*        The array that eventually contains the correlation 'image'.
