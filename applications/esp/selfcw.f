      SUBROUTINE SELFCW( STATUS )             
*+
*  Name:
*     SELFCW

*  Purpose:
*     To perform mixed cross-self-correlations on an NDF image file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SELFCW( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER(Given and Returned)
*     The global status.

*  Description:
*     Performs a mixed cross-self-correlation calculation on an input 
*     NDF image file. The resulting correlation image/plot is stored 
*     to disk.
*
*     The cross-self-correlated image may be used to find faint 
*     diffuse objects for a given scale length.
*
*     The circular exponential profile template used is of a size that 
*     optimises the search for galaxies of the scale length
*     requested by the user.
*
*     To reduce the influence of bright objects or cosmic rays;
*     the user may elect to employ a cut out pixel count value where 
*     any pixel found to be above that value is ignored. The cutout
*     value is determined by the user inputting a global background
*     count value (available via HISTPEAK), the background count 
*     standard deviation and the number of standard deviations above 
*     sky level at which the cutout should occur.
*
*     The user is required to enter a value for the scale length of 
*     of the object(s) of interest and also the image pixel size.
*
*     The method assumes some sort of symmetry is present in the 
*     objects detected but appears to work well on a wide range of 
*     image types.
*
*     A border is present in the output image which is of the same 
*     width as the radius of the template. All pixels within this 
*     border are assigned the value bad.
*
*     The correlation is optimised by making the template size 1.8x 
*     that of the galaxy scale length required. This factor was 
*     determined from simulations by Phillipps and Davies at Cardiff.

*  Usage:
*     SELFCW IN OUT SCALE PSIZE BACK USEALL MULT [SIGMA] [NSIGMA] 

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BACK = _REAL (Read)
*        The modal pixel count value found in the input NDF.
*        Units counts.
*     IN = _NDF (Read)
*        The name of the NDF that is to be examined.
*     NSIGMA = _REAL(Read)
*        The number of standard deviations above the sky level
*        count value at which the pixel count cutoff occurs. 
*     MULT = _REAL (Read)
*        A multiplying factor used to modify the output range. 
*     OUT = _NDF (Write)
*        The name of the NDF that will be created. 
*     PSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The size of each pixel in arc seconds.  If the image contains
*        a SKY co-ordinate frame this value will be determined 
*        automatically.
*     SCALE = _REAL (Read)
*        The scale length of the galaxies being searched for.
*        Units arc seconds.
*     SIGMA = _REAL (Read)
*        The standard deviation of the pixel background count within the 
*        input NDF. Should be determined using a routine such as
*        HISTPEAK which ignores outliers. 
*     USEALL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Used to indicate whether a pixel count threshold is to
*        be a applied when calculating the self-correlation.

*  Examples:
*     selfcw in=p2 out=scp2 scale=15. psize=0.96 back=1000.2 
*            useall=true
*        A self-correlation image, optimised for galaxies of a 15 arc
*        second scale length, is generated using image P2 as the input 
*        source image and SCP2 as the output image. The pixel size
*        on the image is .96 arc second and the background count value 
*        for the source image is 1000.2
*
*     selfcw in=lsbg1 out=lsbg2 scale=8. back=444.  useall=false 
*            sigma=12. nsigma=4.
*        A self-correlation image, optimised for galaxies of a 8 arc
*        second scale length, is generated using image P2 as the input 
*        source image and SCP2 as the output image.  The background 
*        count value for the source image is 444 and the pixel size
*        in arc seconds will be determined from a SKY frame in the 
*        image's WCS component if possible.
*
*        All pixels with a count value greater than 444.+12.x4. are
*        excluded from the correlation calculations.

*  Notes:
*     It is assumed that the x and y axis pixels sizes are the same 
*     size.
*     
*     To establish the statistical significance of a detection, this
*     application should be used in conjunction with MIXUP to allow noise
*     equivalent images to be generated and correlated thereby 
*     establishing a 3 sigma limit.

*  Name:

*  Purpose:

*  Language:

*  Description:
*     Given a source image, the routine generates an equivalent image of
*     similar size that shows, at each pixel, the degree of self-correlation
*     that was present in the circular area around the equivalent point
*     in the source image. Correlation may be both negative, indicating
*     that the object is below sky - probably due to poor flat fielding, or
*     may be positive indicating that there may be an object present.
*
*     The calculation is carried out as follows:
*
*     The value for each pixel of the output image is determined 
*     as follows. An imaginary circle is drawn about the pixel
*     and all pixel pairs within that circle, that lie on opposite
*     sides of the centre from each other, are stored. 
*
*     For each image pixel in turn, all the pixels within a defined
*     radius are identified. These are then examiined to locate pairs of
*     diametrically opposed pixels. The rms value for each of the pairs of
*     pixels (background subtracted) is retained with sign maintained.
*     The value for each of these pairs are multiplied by an exponential
*     function and summed. The total is divided by the number of 
*     pixel pairs used (pairs with bad pixels ignored). This normalised
*     sum is then placed in the appropriate pixel of the output
*     image pixel. The procedure is then returned for the next pixel of
*     the image. 
 
*  Arguments:
*     MULT = REAL (Given)
*        Multiplying factor for the output.
*     ELEMS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in the image.
*     ARRAY(ELEMS) = REAL (Given)
*        The array containing the source NDF image count values.
*     RADIUS = REAL (Given)
*        The radius of the circular template that is used to define
*        the region about a given pixel, that might contribute to the 
*        self-correlation function value that will be inserted into
*        the equivalent pixel in ARRAY2.
*     MODE = REAL (Given)
*        The global mode value supplied by the user. Units counts.
*     XMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of the image x axis. Units pixels.

*        Flag indicating whether or not a pixel count cutoff threshold is
*        being used.
*     HIEST = REAL (Given)
*        The highest pixel count value that will be used in the analysis.
*        All pixels with count values above this will be ignored. Units 
*        counts.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned) 
*        The global status.
