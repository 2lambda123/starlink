*+
*  Name:
*     ELF1_LEVEL

*  Purpose:
*     Provides an estimate of how far out from the image centre you must
*     normally go before the average count is below the threshold level.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ELF1_LEVEL(THRESH,XO,YO,ELEMS,ARRAY,PRANGE,

*  Description:
*     Looks outward from the chosen origin location along lines separated by
*     45 degrees. Determines how far along each of these lines you must

*     
*  Arguments:
*     THRESH = REAL (Given) 
*        Threshold pixel brightness value. Units counts.
*     XO = REAL (Given)
*        Suggested X co-ordinate for the galaxy centre.
*     YO = REAL (Given)
*        Suggested Y co-ordinate for the galaxy centre.
*     ELEMS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels in the image.
*     ARRAY(ELEMS) = REAL (Given)
*        The image array.
*     PRANGE(2) = INTEGE (Given)
*        Size of the image axes. Units pixels.
*     RADIUS = REAL (Returned)
*        First radius of the galaxy to try. Units pixels.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
