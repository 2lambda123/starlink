      SUBROUTINE SKEW( STATUS )             
*+
*  Name:
*     SKEW

*  Purpose:
*     Generates a skewness representation of the image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SKEW( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER(Given and Returned)
*     The global status.

*  Description:
*     Performs skewness calculations on an input NDF image 
*     file. The resulting skewness image/plot is stored to disk.
*
*     Two actions have been taken to reduce the influence of bright 
*     objects or cosmic rays:
*     
*     - the user may elect to employ a cut out pixel count value 
*       where any pixel found to be above that value is ignored. The 
*       cutout value is determined by the user inputting a global mode 
*       value, the background count standard deviation (available via 
*       HISTPEAK) and the number of standard deviations above sky level 
*       at which the cutout should be.
*
*     - a local mean value may be used as the mode.
* 
*     The user is required to enter the size of the sampling area
*     and the pixel size in arc secs. This is used to define the 
*     width of pixel template radius employed. It is assumed that 
*     pixels are the same size in the x and y directions.
*      
*     The skewness value assigned to each pixel of the output image
*     is calculated using the values of pixel count found for all the
*     non-bad pixels within the calculated radius. The value obtained 
*     is multiplied by 1000 (or a user defined value) to make display
*     easier.
*
*     The modal count value used during the calculation is either the
*     global value (defined by the user) or a local value calculated
*     as required.
*
*     The resultant value is some measure of the extent to which the
*     pixel count values surrounding a given pixel are not distributed
*     in a Gaussian manner.
*
*     A border is present in the final output image which is the same 
*     width as the radius of the template used. Pixels within the 
*     border have been assigned the value bad.

*  Usage:
*     SKEW IN OUT MODET WIDTH PSIZE MULT [BACK] [SIGMA] 
*          [NSIGMA] [USEALL]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BACK = _REAL (Read)
*        The background pixel count value found in the input NDF.
*        Units counts. Only used if MODET = TRUE.
*     IN = _NDF (Read)
*        The name of the NDF that is to be examined.
*     MODET = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Used to indicate whether a global modal count value
*        is to be used when calculating the skewness values. 
*        The alternative is for the application to calculate and use the
*        local mode value. See BACK. Using a local background
*        calculation can be slow.
*     MULT = _REAL (Read)
*        A multiplying factor applied to each of the results.
*        Default value is 1000.
*     NSIGMA = _REAL(Read)
*        The number of standard deviations above the sky level
*        count value, where the pixel count cutoff occurs. 
*        Only employed if a global pixel count modal value is 
*        in use (MODET = TRUE).
*     OUT = _NDF (Write)
*        The name of the NDF that will be created. 
*     PSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The size of each pixel in arc seconds.  If the image contains
*        a SKY co-ordinate frame this value will be determined 
*        automatically.
*     SIGMA = _REAL (Read)
*        The standard deviation of the back ground count within the 
*        input NDF. Should be determined using a routine such as
*        HISTPEAK which ignores outliers. Only employed if a global
*        pixel count modal value is in use (MODET = TRUE).
*        Units counts.
*     USEALL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Used to indicate whether a pixel count threshold is to
*        be a applied when calculating the skewness.
*        Only employed if MODET has been set to ensure that
*        a global modal value is in use.
*     WIDTH = _REAL (Read)
*        The width of the sampling area/filter to be passed over the
*        image. Units arc seconds.

*  Examples:
*     skew in=ic3374 out=skewed modet=false width=10. psize=0.5 
*          mult=1000
*        A skewness image named SKEWED is generated using IC3374 as 
*        the source image. The sampling area from which pixels are 
*        selected is 10 arc seconds across. The individual pixel size 
*        is .5 arc seconds so the area is 20 pixels across. All the 
*        skewness values generated for the output image are multiplied 
*        by a factor of 1000, and local background values are used 
*        throughout.
*
*     skew in=jet out=sjet modet=true width=5. mult=1000. 
*          back=2010. useall=true
*        An output image SJET is generated using JET as the source 
*        image. The background count is 2010 and the pixel size will
*        be determined from the WCS component of the source image.
*        All the pixels in the image can be used in the calculation.
*        The sampling area width is 5 arc seconds. All the pixels
*        in the image can be used in the calculation.
*
*     skew in=sgp27 out=result modet=true width=8. psize=1. mult=1000. 
*          back=4505. sigma=23.7 nsigma=10. useall=false
*        The output image generated is created by assuming a global
*        background count of 4505. with an associated standard deviation
*        of 23.7 counts. All pixels of a count value greater 
*        than 4505+23.7x10. are excluded from the calculations.

*  Implementation Status:
*     As the program stands it is useful for looking at an image to 
*     with a view to detecting faint objects and flat-fielding 
*     faults. It may be easily extended by the user to provide 
*     plots showing other statistical quantities such as kurtosis 
*     or S/N.
