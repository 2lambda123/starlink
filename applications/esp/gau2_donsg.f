*+
*   Description:
*     This is the routine which does all the work of running the NSG
*     algorithm.  It repeatedly calls gau2_rnsg, and calls gau2_calc
*     to supply NSG with the arrays of function and jacobian evaluations
*     it asks for.
*
*   Arguments:
*     a = doubleprecision(n*l) (given)
*       Work array.  This is filled with the array of function
*       evaluations by gau2_calc.
*     da = doubleprecision(n*p) (given)
*       Work array.  This is filled with the array of jacobian
*       evaluations by gau2_calc.
*     xinit = doubleprecision(p) (given)
*       Holds the initial-guess values of x.  The routine gives up,
*       setting gau2par(gau2status)=gau2drifted if X drifts too far from
*       this initial value. 
*     in = integer(2,p) (given)
*       The index array, indicating which elements of the jacobian array
*       are which.  See the NSg documentation and gau2_inita for
*       details.
*     iv = integer(liv) (given)
*       Integer work array for NSG.
*     v = doubleprecision(lv) (given)
*       Real work array for NSG.
*     img = doubleprecision(n) (given)
*       The data!
*     xv = integer(n) (given)
*     yv = integer(n) (given)
*       img(i) is the data for point (xv(i),yv(i))
*     driftscale = rdoubleprecision(gau2maxfits) (given)
*       The scalings for the drift calculation.  See gau2_vetodrift for
*       details. 
*     liv = integer (given)
*       The length of IV.
*     lv = integer (given)
*       The length of V.
*     n = integer (given)
*       The number of (good/non-masked) data points
*     l = integer (given)
*       The number of linear parameters/amplitudes.  This will be one
*       more than the number of gaussians if we're fitting the
*       background as well.
*     p = integer (given)
*       The number of non-linear parameters.  This will be five times
*       the number of gaussians (ie, 5 n-l parameters each).
*     x = doubleprecision(p) (returned)
*       The array of (non-linear) parameters which have been fitted.  
*       This is The Answer!
*     c = doubleprecision(l) (returned)
*       The array of linear parameters to be fitted (ie, the amplitudes
*       of the gaussians).
*     gau2par = integer(gau2len) (given and modified)
*       Array of parameters and feedback.  See the include file gau_par
*       for the indexes
*     status = integer (given)

*   Local variables

*   When we calculate a and da, we actually do both at once, since the
*   calculations of the derivatives only take a few multiplications more
*   than the calculations of the function values.  This will usually
*   result in a little wasted effort, but this will be repaid, since
*   whenever we want the gradients (less often than the values), they'll
*   be sitting there without further calculation.  Obviously, we can
*   only do this if we keep track of which evaluations correspond to
*   each other; that's what savenf, iv(6) and iv(7) are for.  
* 
*   The plan, then is this: drnsg returns asking for A (and giving an
*   invocation count iv(6)), or a DA (giving the invocation count iv(7)
*   to which the x vector corresponds).  If we're asked for an A, then
*   we calculate both with calcada, and store iv(6) in saveda.  If we're
*   asked for a DA, then we expect that the last thing we were asked for
*   was the A for this same x, which we can check by comparing
*   saveda=iv(7), and which we can immediately supply - this isn't
*   guaranteed, or even suggested, by the algorithm, nor do we rely on
*   it, but it turns out to be generally true in practice.  That is, the
*   usual, but not invariable, pattern is several requests for A,
*   followed by a request for DA evaluated at the last X at which we
*   evaluated A.  We monitor how true this is by counting up in
*   gau2par(gau2calcda) the number of times we had to call calcada
*   because we had to supply a DA `out of turn' - this number should be
*   close to zero.
*
*   The pattern is slightly different when we're calculating the
*   regression diagnostic - that's primarily (entirely?) requests for A
*   alone.
*
*   The documentation for drnsg says that A and DA are overwritten.
*   This appears not to be true for DA: inspection of the code suggests
*   that although A is replaced by part of its QR decomposition, DA is
*   simply read.  This is given support by examining checksums of the
*   two arrays before and after the call to drnsg.  This means that we
*   can safely leave DA in place and hand it over next time we're asked
*   for it.

***** gau2_drift

      real function gau2_drift (ng, x, xinit, driftscale)

*   Description:
*     Returns a measure of how far the parameters in X have drifted from
*     the initial values in XINIT.  The metric returned is scaled so
*     that >1 indicates `too far'.  The parameter scales on
*     which this decision is made are passed in driftscales, but the
*     detailed semantics of these scales are left up to this routine.
*
*   Arguments:
*     ng = integer (given)
*       The number of gaussians
*     x = doubleprecision(5*ng) (given)
*       The current parameter vector.
*     xinit = doubleprecision(5*ng) (given)
*       The initial parameter vector.
*     driftscale = doubleprecision(5*ng) (given)
*       The scales of the elements in the parameter vector.
*
*   Discussion:
*     What we do here is just add up (x(i)-xinit(i))/driftscale(i),
*     i=1..5*ng, where driftscale(i)>=0, and divide the result by the
*     number of positive values in driftscale().
*     We could alternatively make the calculation based 
*     on whether each component, or each group of five, had drifted.
*
*     That is, we can exempt an element of the vector from this
*     calculation by setting the corresponding driftscale negative.
*
*     An earlier version of this routine returned a logical value.  This
*     is probably more sensible, given the potential variations in the
*     way the decision is made, but it inhibits me from providing a single
*     numerical measure of drift to present as feedback to the user.
