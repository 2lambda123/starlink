*  Name: 
*     COR1_CORR

*  Purpose:
*     Performs correlation calculations for a circular symmetrical
*     template of known diameter. It assumes a global mode value.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COR1_CORR(MULT,ELEMS,%VAL(POINT1(1)),RADIUS,MODE,
*                    XMAX,YMAX,USEALL,HIEST,STATUS,%VAL(POINT2(1)))  
      
*  Description:
*     Given a source image, the routine generates an equivalent image of
*     similar size that shows, at each pixel, the degree of correlation
*     that was present in the circular area around the equivalent point
*     in the source image. Correlation should normally be near zero for
*     a Gaussian (Normal) distribution. Large deviations from this 
*     suggest regions either containing objects.
*
*     The calculation is carried out as follows:
*
*     The value for each pixel of the output image is determined 
*     as follows. An imaginary circle is drawn about the pixel
*     and the count values for all pixels within that circle, 
*     are stored. 
*
*     The values then have the background value subtracted and are
*     multiplied by an elliptical factor depending on the distance of
*     pixel from the resident pixel. 
*
*     The template size is set as 1.8x the size of the galaxy to be detected.
*     This is the optimal size.
*
*     The individual contributions from all the pixels within the user defined
*     radius are summed and then divided by the number found (non-bad) to
*     normalise the result. 

*  Arguments:
*     MULT = REAL (Given)
*        The multiplying value applied to all the correlation values.
*     ELEMS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in the image.
*     ARRAY(ELEMS) = REAL (Given)
*        The array containing the source NDF image count values.
*     RADIUS = REAL (Given)
*        The radius of the circular template that is used to define
*        the region about a given pixel, that might contribute to the 
*        correlation value that will be inserted into
*        the equivalent pixel in ARRAY2.
*     MODE = REAL (Given)
*        The global mode value supplied by the user. Units counts.
*     XMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of the image x axis. Units pixels.
*     YMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of the y axis of the image. Units pixels.
*     USEALL = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Flag indicating whether or not pixels of too high a value will be
*        ignored.
*     HIEST = REAL (Given)
*        The highest pixel count value that will be used in the analysis.
*        All pixels with count values above this will be ignored. Units 
*        counts.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned) 
*        The global status.     
*     ARRAY2(ELEMS) = REAL (Returned)
*        The array that eventually contains the correlation 'image'.
