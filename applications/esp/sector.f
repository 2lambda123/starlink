      SUBROUTINE SECTOR(STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     SECTOR

*  Purpose:
*     May be used to display the average pixel values within a wedge 
*     shaped sector/slice of the image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SECTOR( STATUS )

*  Arguments:   
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description: 
*     May be used to display the average pixel values within a wedge 
*     shaped sector/slice of the image. The sector is in the form of a 
*     wedge (of user defined size) drawn outward from the galaxy 
*     origin point.
*
*     The results are displayed as mean pixel value (in terms of level 
*     relative to sky or surface brightness) versus distance from the 
*     galaxy origin. Pixel count values are summed over all the pixels 
*     at a given distance from the origin.
*
*     Options include:
*       - summing pixels taken  from two equal sized, but 
*         diametrically opposite, sectors.
*       - displaying data using a number of possible radius 
*         transformations. 
*       - the use of a graphics cursor to select the image object 
*         to be examined.
*       - refinement of approximate galaxy centre positions 
*         if required.
*       - automatic selection of the maximum radius out 
*         from the origin to be considered. 
*
*     The application is not intended to replace ELLPRO or ELLFOU
*     profiling application, but merely to allow the user to obtain 
*     quickly a first approximation to the brightness cross-section of 
*     an interactively selected galaxy.

*        is profiled in the 25 degree direction out to a distance of 25
*        arc seconds. The Current co-ordinate frame of IC3374 is in 
*        the SKY domain. The pixel size in arcseconds is determined 
*        automatically from the SKY coordinate frame. The wedge/sector 
*        used will be 5 degrees wide and the scale length will be
*        calculated using data obtained in the radius range 0-20 arc
*        seconds. The user supplied estimate of the galaxy centre will
*        not be refined. Output is to the text file ic3374.pro. The 
*        graphs generated will be quarter power radius versus surface 
*        brightness.

*  Name:
*     SEC1_PIE

*  Purpose:
*     Looks at the image array stored and take the values it needs to
*     create an array containing the sum of all the pixels within
*     the required slice that are not bad valued. The index of the 
*     array indicates the radial distance from the chosen origin.
*     Each array element may be considered to be PSIZE in width and
*     the radius corresponding to each element is (I-1)*PSIZE since
*     FORTRAN does not allow a zeroth element for an array as default.
      
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:   
*     CALL SEC1_PIE(CLEAR,BACK,ELEMS,XCO,YCO,PRANGE,POSANG,ANGWID,NVP,
*                   NUMBER,SUMMAT,RLIM,ARRAY,STATUS)   

*  Description:
*     The subroutine used to sum the values of all pixels at a given 
*     radius in the results array (SUMMAT) and also keep a count 
*     of how many data points contribute to that summation in 
*     array NUMBER.
*
*     The method used to locate all the points is given below.
*   
*     Concentric arc of pixels about the origin are considered 
*     in turn. Each arc differs from the previous arc in its radius
*     by one pixel. To ensure that all pixels within an arc are found 
*     the arc is scanned from an angle equal to the position angle
*     minus half the angular width to an angle equal to the
*     position angle plus half the angular width of the section. The
*     angular step between points on the arc is adjusted at each new
*     radius value to ensure all pixels are found. The arbitrary steps
*     used have been tested for radii up to 8000. 
*    
*     When all the pixels within a given arc have been examined the
*     radius used to generate the arc is increased. This increase
*     continues until the requested arc radius has been exceeded or the
*     application detects that the edge of the object has been reached.
*     
*     Automatic selection of the maximum required radius out from the 
*     origin pixel may be selected by entering a length value of 0.

*  Arguments:             
*     CLEAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        Defines whether or not the SUMMAT and NUMBER arrays should

*  Name:
*     SEC1_POSAN

*  Purpose:
*     Calculates the position angle and length of two points from the image.
      
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SEC1_POSAN(X1,Y1,X2,Y2,POSANG,RADIUS,FLAG,STATUS)
   
*  Description:
*     The co-ordinates of two points on the image are used to calculate
*     the distance between the two points (same units as those supplied).
*     That is then used to determine the arc sine value for the angle of
*     a line between the two points and the vertical image axis. The units
*     for the angle are radians, vertically upward has a value 0 and the
*     angle increases in a clockwise direction.
*     
*     FLAG is returned with a non-zero value if the angle between the 
*     points could not be calculated due to the start and end locations 
*     being the same.

*  Arguments:         
*     X1 = REAL (Given)
*        Image X co-ordinate for the centre of the sector. 
*        Units of input must be consistent.
*     Y1 = REAL (Given)
*        Image Y co-ordinate for the centre of the sector.
*        Units of input must be consistent.
*     X2 = REAL (Given)
*        Image X co-ordinate for a point away from the centre.
*        Units of input must be consistent.
*     Y2 = REAL (Given)
*        Image Y co-ordinate for a point away from the centre.
*        Units of input must be consistent.
*     POSANG = REAL (Returned)
*        Angle between the central point of the sector and a
*        point defined X2,Y2. Units radians.
*     RADIUS = REAL (Returned)
*        Distance between the central point of the sector and a
*        point defined X2,Y2. Units as supplied.
*     FLAG = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Used to indicate if it was impossible to measure the angle.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
