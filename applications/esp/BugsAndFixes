* Tue 17 Feb: Initial list of minor alterations [Completed ages ago]

	My first ESP change!  Altered the esp.csh script to use the
	ADAM_USER variable, like the comment says it does.

* Feb: Rodney [Completed ages ago]

	Change output format to display FWHM rather than sigma, in
	units of arcsec, rather than pixels.

* Mar: Agreed with Derek Ward-Thompson and Rodney

	Improve the GAUFIT fitting algorithm, by making NSG (from
	PORT) an alternative to Grant's one.
	
! Thu 4 Jun: Malcolm Currie

	I've just been trying to use ESP/GAUFIT and found that it
	doesn't do what I want, because it doesn't write the computed
	values to parameters, only to a text file.

* Thu 4 Jun: Malcolm Currie [Fixed 4 June]

	In interactive mode, it asks you to hit right mouse button
	_and_ (my emphasis) CTRL-C to quit selection of Gaussians to
	fit.  This should be "or CTRL-C".

? Thu 4 Jun: Malcolm Currie [Fixed? 4 June]

	Despite putting the value for parameter OUT on the command
	line, GAUFIT prompts me for it!  That's not appreciated in an
	automatic script. (-: The file I'm creating does not exist.
	Indeed its suggested default is the value I gave on the
	command line, and hitting the return key creates the results
	file correctly.  Looking at the interface file I notice that
	the text files are type _CHAR and not FILENAME.  Does this
	mean that they're using PAR_GET0C and a Fortran open statement
	instead of FIO?  This might be a clue why parameter OUT
	behaves peculiarly.

? Thu 4 Jun: Malcolm Currie [Fixed? 10 June 1998]

	The global value of COSYS is ignored.  This parameter should
	be defaulted to the global value.  See one of the KAPPA tasks,
	e.g.  CENTROID, for an example.  Likewise parameter IMGDEV
	doesn't use the current graphics device.  (This may be the
	case in other ESP graphics tasks too.)  Yet parameters XINC
	and YINC without global associations have global in their
	ppath.

	[Added global to ppath of COSYS and IMGDEV, removed it from *INC]

* Thu 4 Jun: Malcolm Currie [Fixed? (I remember doing this, but don't have a date)]

	On a more-general point, there is no online help in response
	to ? or ??  at prompts.

* August 1998: Quick programming service

	Made a couple of changes to the elp1_stats routine of ellpro,
	in response to a Quick service request from Paul Lynam at
	LivJM.  Notes in Notes-lynam

! November 1998: Jonathan Smoker <J.Smoker@Queens-Belfast.AC.uk>

	Requested help on ARDFIL.  Looking at ards.f it appears that
	ESP_ARD_DRIVER returns a warning whether you type !
	(=PAR__NULL, cf SUN/114) in response to the ARDFIL prompt, or
	!! (=PAR__ABORT).  The latter should cause the application to
	stop, and it doesn't.

! November 1998: me

	As a result of that, I realised that the command line
	  ...ardfil=! origin=[100,100]
	will cause csh to barf, because both ! and [ are significant
	to the shell.  Include a note in the documentation warning
	about this, and suggesting either explicit escaping, or
	putting the arguments in single quotes.  Also, ards.f
	calls par_cancl, which (I think) carefully discards any value
	of ardfil the user sets on the command line.  Is there some
	twisted reason why this is a Good Idea?
