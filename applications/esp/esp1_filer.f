     :                      NSOUR,XC,YC,RLIM,HINT,FWHM,STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     GAU1_FILER
*
*  Purpose:
*     Opens a user specified text file and reads from it a list of
*     values that specify the source position and radius.
*
*     The co-ordinates obtained are returned in the arrays XC and YC. The
*     number of co-ordinate pairs defined is assigned to NSOUR. If the 
*     co-ordinates are legal (i.e. within the image) then another value 
*     is read from the line (if available) and this is used as the radius 
*     when the profile is calculated.
*
*     If column 3-6 are found, these are assumed to be the estimate 
*     of position angle, Sa, Sb and peak values provided by the user. 
*      
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
*
*  Invocation:
*      CALL GAU1_FILER(FIOID,INDF,NSOUR,
*                      XC,YC,RLIM,HINT,FWHM,STATUS)    
*
*  Description:
*     Looks at each line of the required file in turn.
*     Ignores blank lines and those starting with # or ! since these
*     are assumed to be comments. Others it examines for the presence
*     of two numbers. If these are found it looks for a further number.
*
*     The first two are taken as representing x and y co-ordinates on 
*     an image and are checked to ensure that they lie within the bounds 
*     of the image.
*
*     If it is found that the a co-ordinate pair is not within the 
*     bounds of the image, the values are not retained, otherwise the
*     counter is incremented and the values stored in arrays XC and YC.
*     The line is then examined to determine if a further value is present.
*     If a value is found it is to used as the initial HINT value.
*
*  Arguments:               
*     FIOID = INTEGER (Given)
*        FIO identifier for the input file.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        NDF identifier for the image.

*     YC(10,2) = REAL (Returned)
*        Y co-ordinates (for sources) obtained from the text file.
*     RLIM(10) = REAL (Returned)
*        The source radii values. Units pixels.
*     HINT(4,10) = REAL (Returned)
*        Initial guesses from file. Units pixels.  [See gau1_guess for
*        mapping hint()<-->guess(), and gau1_build for meaning of guess()]
*           hint(1,i) = guess(i,5) = sigma_a
*           hint(2,i) = guess(i,6) = sigma_b
*           hint(3,i) = guess(i,7) = angle of major axis
*           hint(4,i) = guess(i,4) = peak height
*     FWHM = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Work in units of FWHM, rather than sigma.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     9-Mar-1996 (GJP)
*     (Original version)
*     26-OCT-1999 (MBT):
*        Modified to cope with COSYS=C.
*     8-NOV-1999 (MBT):
*       Removed COSYS altogether.
*     8-Nov-1999 (NG)
*       Corrected estimate of rlim() from crazy averaging of major axis
*       and _angle_!  Altered so that if it finds 3 numbers on the input
*       line, the third is taken to be the source radius (ie, now matches
*       the `purpose' line at the top).
*
*  Bugs:
*     None known.

*

*     image, the values are not retained, otherwise the counter is
*     incremented and the values stored in arrays XC and YC.
*
*     The co-ordinates obtained are returned in the arrays XC and YC. the
