      REAL FUNCTION ESP1_MEDIAN(V,GOOD,N,WS,STATUS)
*+
*   Name:
*     ESP1_MEDIAN
*
*   Purpose:
*     Calculate the median of the good pixels of the array V(N).
*     Non-destructive - ie, it does not reorder V.
*
*   Language:
*     Fortran 77
*
*   Invocation:
*     MEDIAN = ESP1_MEDIAN (V, GOOD, N, %VAL(WS), STATUS)
*
*   Description:
*     Uses a destructive selection algorithm to find the median element
*     in V after copying it to a workspace WS, which the caller
*     guarantees is at least N elements in size. The algorithm is based
*     on that described in Numerical Recipes (in C), without using any
*     actual code from there.
*
*   Errors:
*     Sets STATUS to be sai__error and returns 0.0 if there are no
*     good pixels, or if either of the sanity-check assertions at the
*     end fails.
*
*   Arguments:
*     V(N) = REAL (Given)
*       The array we're to find the median of
*     GOOD(N) = INTEGER (Given)
*       GOOD(i) is non-zero if we are to use the element V(i).
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*       The size of the arrays V and GOOD
*     WS(N) = REAL (Given)
*       A workspace, into which we may temporarily copy V.  The actual
*       workspace will be at least N in length.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*       Inherited status
