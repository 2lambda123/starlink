\section{\xlabel{se_kaprhintro}Introduction\label{se:kaprhintro}}

KAPRH forms a sort of ``rest home'' for old and worn-out KAPPA commands,
that is, commands which have been removed from the KAPPA package for
various reasons. They are retained here in order to satisfy
any occasional need there may be for them. It is not intended to spend
any significant effort in the maintenance or development of these
commands - they are presented ``as is''.

This document contains the reference information for these commands, but
does not contain any general information about data structure,
parameters, \emph{etc}. See SUN/95 for extra information. The one
exception to this is that the appendix contains a description of the
old IMAGE format data structure which is used by some of the commands within
KAPRH.

\section{\xlabel{ap_full}Specifications of KAPRH applications\label{ap:full}}
\subsection{Explanatory Notes}
For historical reasons, in this Appendix there are two formats---the
first, exemplified by \htmlref{TURBOCONT}{TURBOCONT}, is the layout indicating
that this is one of the applications which uses the NDF structure. An
example of the old style is \htmlref{QUILT}{QUILT}.  Applications
in this format use the moribund \htmlref{IMAGE format}{ap:IMAGEformat}.

\begin{description}
\item [NDF layout]
In this layout the specification of parameters has the following
format.

\begin{verbatim}
     name  =  type (access)
        description
\end{verbatim}
This format also includes a \emph{Usage\/} entry.  \label{ap:usage}
This shows how the application is invoked from the command line.  It
lists the positional parameters in order followed by any prompted
keyword parameters using a \mbox{``KEYWORD=?''} syntax.  Defaulted
keyword parameters do not appear.  Positional parameters that are
normally defaulted are indicated by being enclosed in square brackets.
Keyword ({\it{i.e.}}\ not positional) parameters are needed where the
number of parameters are large, and usually occur because they depend
on the value of another parameter.  These are denoted by a curly
brace; the parameters on each line are related, and each line is
mutually exclusive.  An example should clarify.
\bigskip

{\ssttt \hspace*{1.0em}
        contour ndf [comp] mode ncont [key] [device]
        \newline\hspace*{2.5em}
        $\left\{ {\begin{tabular}{l}
                    FIRSTCNT=? STEPCNT=? \\
                    HEIGHTS=?
                   \end{tabular} }
        \right.$
        \newline\hspace*{2.9em}
        \makebox[0mm][c]{\footnotesize mode}
}
\bigskip

NDF, COMP, MODE, NCONT, KEY, DEVICE, and SMOOTHING are all positional
parameters.  Only NDF, MODE, and NCONT would be prompted if not given
on the command line.  The remaining parameters depend on the value of
MODE.  If the mode is to nominate a list of contour heights, HEIGHTS
will be needed (MODE~=~{\tt "Free"}); alternatively, if the mode requires a
start height and spacing between contours FIRSTCNT and STEPCNT should be
specified (MODE~=~{\tt "Linear"} or {\tt "Magnitude"}).  Note that there
are other modes which do not require additional information, and hence no
more parameters.

There is also an \emph{Examples\/} section. \label{ap:example}  This
shows how to run the application from the command line.  More often
you'll enter the command name and just some of the parameters, and be
prompted for the rest. \emph{Note that from the C-shell you must escape
any special characters that appear in these examples.} For instance,
the fourth example of COMPAVE would be written like this

\begin{verbatim}
     compave cosmos galaxy '[4,3]' weight title='"COSMOS compressed"'
\end{verbatim}

from the C-shell.

\item [IMAGE layout]
In this layout the specification of parameters has the following format
\begin{verbatim}
    name    type    access    description
\end{verbatim}
\end{description}
\medskip

The following notes apply to both layouts.

Some parameters will only be used when another parameter has a certain
value or mode. These are indicated by the name of the mode in
parentheses at the end of the parameter description, but before any
default, {\it{e.g.}}\ parameter DEVICE in \htmlref{INSPECT}{INSPECT}
is only relevant when parameter MODE is {\tt "Cursor"}.

{\tt \%name} means the value of parameter {\it name}.

The description entry has a notation scheme to indicate
normally defaulted parameters, {\it{i.e.}}\ those for which there will
be no prompt.
For such parameters a matching pair of square brackets ({\tt{[]}})
terminates the description.  The content between the brackets mean
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt{[]}}]
Empty brackets means that the default is created dynamically
by the application, and may depend on the values of other parameters.
Therefore, the default cannot be given explicitly.
\item[{\tt [,]}]
As above, but there are two default values that are created dynamically.
\item[{\tt [}{\rm default}{\tt{]}}]
Occasionally, a description of the default is given in normal type,
{\it{e.g.}}\ the size of the plotting region in a graphics application,
where the exact default values depend on the device chosen.
\item[{\tt [default]}]
If the brackets contain a value in teletype-fount, this is the explicit
default value.
\end{description}

\sstroutine{
   CONTOVER
}{
   Contours a 2-d NDF overlaid on an image displayed previously
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application draws a contour plot of a 2-dimensional NDF
      using an efficient algorithm.  The array may be part or whole of
      the data array, but also the variance or quality can be shown.

      The contour plot is drawn over an existing image that is
      displayed on the chosen graphics workstation or its overlay,
      provided the displayed image has been recorded in the
      graphics database.  (This will be the case for display routines
      in KAPPA.)  The contour plotting occurs within the current picture
      only if it is a DATA picture, otherwise contours are overlaid in
      the last DATA picture within the current picture.  This
      application assumes that the world co-ordinate systems of the data
      array and the displayed image are both in pixel units, but not to
      the same origins.  Pixel $x$-$y$ offsets may be given to match the
      contour plot with the image, provided some contouring will be
      visible.  These displacements are in the sense image co-ordinate
      minus the data-array co-ordinate for an arbitrary fiducial point.

      The contouring algorithm has only pixel resolution, and
      so the contours are not smooth, but this makes the processing
      much faster.  There are seven methods for selecting contours.

      The best way to use this application is to first display an image
      on the base plane of an image display, make this the current
      picture, and then plot contours on the overlay plane, clearing
      the overlay picture each time. This enables more than one attempt
      at getting the correct contour heights.  The underlying image will
      not be erased. (Note that if you do not make the underlying image
      the current picture, the contour plot becomes the last DATA
      picture, and so any subsequent $x$-$y$ offsets should be set to 0,0 to
      prevent successive contour plots being incorrectly located.)

                         which the equivalent radius increases by equal
                         increments.  You specify the number of levels.

                        explicitly.

                        contour level and linear step between contours.
         \item \texttt{"Magnitude"} --- You define the number of contours, the start
                        contour level and step between contours.  The
                        step size is in magnitudes so the $n^{\rm th}$

         There are some options for setting the characteristics of the
         contour lines.  By default, solid lines are drawn with the same
         colour as the axes and key, namely the foreground colour.  The
         colour will depend on the graphics device chosen, but it is often
         black for printers or white for terminals.  The alternatives to
         override this default behaviour are listed below.

         \begin{enumerate}
         \item Set a colour for all contours using parameter CONCOL.
               The choices may be quite restrictive on certain devices,
               for example a window overlay only has one colour.  Use
               the PALENTRY command to change this colour.
         \item Request dashed contours below some threshold given by
               parameter DASHED and solid lines for other heights.  All
               contours have either the foreground colour or that
               prescribed by parameter CONCOL.
         \item Cycle the pens modulo 3 for each contour height actually
               plotted by setting PENROT = \texttt{TRUE}.  The characteristics of
               the second and third line styles will depend on the chosen
               graphics device.  An image display or pen plotter will draw
               coloured lines using palette entries 1 to 3; whereas a
               window overlay, or monochrome laser printer or terminal
               will draw a variety of dashed or thicker lines.
         \item Combine options 2 and 3.  However, palette colours 1 to 3
               will always be used and CONCOL ignored.  The contours below
               the threshold continue the cycle through the three colours.
               There may be some confusion on devices that already use
               dashed lines, so this is only suitable for devices
               supporting at least three colours simultaneously.
         \end{enumerate}

         Pen rotation takes precedence over colour control through CONCOL.

   Creates or manipulates an image-display lookup table using a
   palette
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application allows a lookup table to be created or modified
      interactively on a chosen image display from a palette of
      colours.  All plotting is performed within the current
      graphics-database picture for that device.  The phases in the
      creation or manipulation of the lookup table are enumerated below.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item The initial colour table is read from an NDF lookup-table file
         or a greyscale used if there is no input lookup table.
      \item The name of an NDF containing a 2-dimensional array is obtained and the
         array is scaled and displayed in the top half of the picture
         at the largest magnification without distortion.  Below this an
         histogram of the values between the scaling limits is drawn
         with the colour index of each bin corresponding to the bin's
         scaled value. Thus colours in the image and the histogram
         match.   Axes of number versus data value are plotted about
         the histogram. If a null character, \texttt{!}, is given then no NDF
         array is read and a ramp is produced instead of the histogram.
         An axis of pen numbers in the lookup table is drawn around the
         ramp.
      \item A numbered palette is drawn below the histogram.  A palette
         created in an earlier run of CRELUT may be restored from an
         NDF.  Otherwise the palette comprises eight coloured blocks
         (black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta and cyan)
         with palette numbers 0--7, an eight-level greyscale (8--15)
         and a sixteen-level greyscale (16--31).  Palette numbers
         16--31 may be replaced randomly by colours you define.  The
         colours are specified by either the giving the red, green, blue
         intensities; or by name.  The loop is terminated by a null.
      \item Inside a loop you select the palette colour(s) to be
         assigned to the first and last pen numbers of a band within
         the lookup table.  For convenience, where there is an image
         and histogram the equivalent data values are entered rather
         than pen numbers directly, though they are converted to the
         nearest pens in the lookup table.  Linear interpolation
         between the two palette colours yields the lookup-table
         colours inside the band.  Should only one colour be given then
         all the pens in the requested range are set to that colour.
         Pen numbers may be re-used indefinitely and assigned new
         colours if the desired effect is not obtained.  (The histogram
         of the array is produced to assist in a sensible choice).  The
         loop is terminated by a null in response to either of the
         prompts.
      \item The lookup table may be saved in an NDF.  A null response,
         \texttt{!}, to the request for the name of the file in which the table is
         to be stored will result in the table not being saved.
         Likewise the palette may be saved in an NDF.

   INSPECT
}{
   Inspects a 2-d NDF in a variety of ways
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application provides an interactive facility to inspect the
      details of whole or part of the 2-dimensional data array in an input NDF.
      Briefly, the inspection options permit: a region to be selected
      for which statistics may be calculated, its values written to a
      text file, or an histogram be plotted and saved in an NDF; the
      region itself may be saved in an NDF; the value of a pixel or a
      region of pixels to be viewed; a slice between two pixels may be
      calculated, plotted and saved in an NDF; text files containing
      $x$-$y$-value of selected pixels may be created and extended, and
      chosen pixels marked.

      The application has two modes of interaction: cursor and
      interface.  In cursor mode the selection of pixels, and the
      definition of the region are made by moving a graphics cursor
      over a previously displayed image or contour plot.  Since
      instructional text showing the function of the mouse or
      trackerball buttons is shown, the graphics device providing the
      cursor must be an image-display overlay.  Also the name of the
      NDF used to display the image or contour plot is known and need
      not be entered.  This is the recommended interaction mode.  The
      alternative, interface, means that the pixel indices of pixels
      and regions to be inspected are specified in response to prompts.

      The application is composed of two parts.  First the preliminaries
      obtains the mode, the input NDF and graphics devices.  In cursor
      mode this usually amounts to a single prompt, and but two in
      interface mode.  The second stage is a loop where the inspection
      option is selected and performed.

         \item \texttt{"Device"} --- This allows the selection and opening of a new
                          line-plot graphics device, at the same time
                          closing down the old one, whose last plot is
                          stored in the graphics database.
         \item \texttt{"Exit"} --- Exit the application.
         \item \texttt{"Histogram"} --- This calculates the histogram of the current
                          region. A summary and plot (if there is a
                          graphics device available) of the histogram
                          is produced.  The style of the plot may be
                          adjusted via several parameters.  The full
                          histogram may also be reported. The histogram
                          data can be stored in a 1-d NDF.
         \item \texttt{"List"} --- This produces a formatted and headed listing
                          of the chosen region to a text file.
         \item \texttt{"Peep"} --- Obtain a formatted listing of the 7$\times$7 section
                          of the array data, centred on a pixel
                          specified using the cursor or via prompting.
         \item \texttt{"Region"} --- To define the region of the array to be used
                          by other options. If the image display
                          is available, then the cursor is used to
                          define the area, otherwise, the pixel bounds
                          of the region come from the environment. Using
                          the cursor, the functions of the choice-device
                          buttons are drawn on the overlay.
         \item \texttt{"Save"} --- Writes the current region to a new NDF,
                          propagating all the components.
         \item \texttt{"Slice"} --- Two points are defined via the cursor or from
                          parameter prompting between which a slice ({\it i.e.}
                          cross-section) is calculated.  Using the
                          cursor, the functions of the trackerball or
                          mouse buttons are drawn on the overlay. A plot
                          is made to the graphics device if available.
                          The style of the plot may be adjusted via
                          several parameters.  The slice can be stored
                          in a 1-d NDF.  The slice abscissa has units in
                          true pixels (assuming pixels are square), thus
                          a 45\dgs\ slice would have a length $\surd$2
                          times its projected length in $x$ or $y$.
         \item \texttt{"Statistics"} --- The key statistical parameters of the current
                          region are determined and reported.
         \item \texttt{"Value"} --- Obtain the value of a pixel at a point selected
                          via the cursor or via prompting.
         \item \texttt{"XYcur"} --- A list of the co-ordinates and values of pixels
                          selected by the image-display cursor are
                          written to a text file with Fortran carriage
                          control. The functions of the trackerball or
                          mouse buttons are displayed.  Optionally, an
                          existing file in the same format as produced
                          by XYcur can be appended to, for example, when
                          a session has been interrupted.  These stored
                          pixels are displayed on the overlay plane as
                          if there had been no interruption.  XYcur
                          requires cursor mode.

      The help information is arranged hierarchically.  You can
      move around the help information whenever KRHHELP prompts.  This
      occurs when it has either presented a screen's worth of text or
      has completed displaying the previously requested help.  The
      information displayed by KRHHELP on a particular topic includes
      a description of the topic and a list of subtopics that further
      describe the topic.

      At a prompt you may enter:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         a topic and/or subtopic name(s) to display the help for that
         topic or subtopic, so for example, \texttt{block parameters box}
         gives help on \texttt{BOX}, which is a subtopic of \texttt{Parameters},
         which in turn is a subtopic of \texttt{BLOCK};

         \sstitem
         a \texttt{$<$CR$>$} to see more text at a \texttt{Press RETURN to
         continue ...} request;

         \sstitem
         a \texttt{$<$CR$>$} at topic and subtopic prompts to move up one
         level in the hierarchy, and if you are at the top level it will
         terminate the help session;

         \sstitem
         a \texttt{CTRL/D }(pressing the CTRL and D keys simultaneously) in
         response to any prompt will terminate the help session;

         \sstitem
         a question mark \texttt{?} to redisplay the text for the current topic,
         including the list of topic or subtopic names; or

         \sstitem
         an ellipsis \texttt{...} to display all the text below the current
         point in the hierarchy.  For example, \texttt{BLOCK...} displays
         information on the BLOCK topic as well as information on all the
         subtopics under BLOCK.

      You can abbreviate any topic or subtopic using the following rules.

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         Just give the first few characters, {\it e.g.}\ \texttt{PARA} for
         \texttt{Parameters}.

         \sstitem
         Some topics are composed of several words separated by
         underscores.  Each word of the keyword may be abbreviated,
         {\it e.g.}\ \texttt{Colour\_Set} can be shortened to \texttt{C\_S}.

         \sstitem
         The characters \texttt{\%} and \texttt{$\lsk$} act as wildcards, where
         the percent sign matches any single character, and asterisk
         matches any sequence of characters.  Thus to display information
         on all available topics, type an asterisk in reply to a prompt.

         \sstitem
         If a word contains, but does end with an asterisk wildcard, it
         must not be truncated.

         \sstitem
         The entered string must not contain leading or embedded spaces.

   Highlights a colour table of an image-display device
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine adjusts the colour table of a nominated plane of
      an IDI-supported image display, such as X-windows.  The adjustment
      is like a highlight pen, only here it can traverse the colour
      table, widen or thin is under mouse, joystick or trackerball
      button control; and the colour of the highlight is arbitrary.
      Thus particular features in an image may readily become visible.

      For an Ikon or X-windows, moving the mouse left or right shifts
      the highlight in the colour table towards lower and higher colour
      indices respectively.  The highlight does not rotate around the
      colour table.  Pressing the left button of the mouse reduces the
      width of the highlight by one colour index.  Pressing the centre
      button increases the width of the highlight by one colour index.
      Hitting the right-hand button ends the modification of the colour
      table.

      The colour table may be viewed during its manipulation without
      permanently altering the display memory.  The colour-table
      display is situated via the cursor, and will disappear once the
      highlighting is complete.

\sstdescription{
  Up to 20 non-congruent 2-d data arrays may be input, along with
  their relative offsets from the first data array, and these are
  then made into a mosaic into one (usually larger) output 2-d data
  array. Where the frames overlap, either the mean value or just the
  sum is inserted into the output data array. Normally averaging is
  performed. All data arrays are stored in \texttt{IMAGE} structures.

  The magic-value method is used for processing bad data.  Bad
  pixels are excluded from the averaging in overlap areas. Output
  pixels that have been mapped or correspond to one or more input
  arrays, yet have no good pixels contributing, are set to bad.
  Pixels in the output data array not mapped by any of the input
  arrays are set to zero.

}{
Generates a mosaic from equally sized 2-d data arrays, optionally specified from an ASCII file.
}{
\sstdescription{
  This routine provides a more-sophisticated version of the {\texttt{MOSAIC}}
  application for combining many 2-d data arrays into one large
  output data array. All the data arrays are stored in {\texttt{IMAGE}}
  structures.  The pixels in overlapping regions may be averaged or
  summed.

  The names of {\texttt{IMAGE}} structures to be concatenated and their
  respective offsets of their data arrays from a central
  data array can be input either one by one from the interface, or
  all at once from a free-format file.  The format of the file is
  as follows:  \mbox {}

  \begin{tabular}{@{\hspace{11mm}}l@{\hspace{24mm}}l}
        \\
        \texttt{Mosaic title}     & ! header \\
        \texttt{central\_image}   & ! name of central {\texttt{IMAGE}} \\
        \texttt{125}              & ! total number of frames \\
        \texttt{345  229}         & ! maximum {$x$}-{$y$} offsets \\
        \texttt{-356  -232}       & ! minimum {$x$}-{$y$} offsets \\
        \texttt{image\_2}         & ! subsequent {\texttt{IMAGE}} and \\
        \texttt{35  34}           & ! its {$x$}-{$y$} offsets \\
        \texttt{image\_3}         & \\
        \texttt{36  -33}          & \\
        \texttt{.}                & \\
        \texttt{.}                & \\
        \texttt{.}                & \\
        \\
  \end{tabular}

  Only like-sized data arrays may be input. The reason for this is
  that it is difficult to work out how big the output data array
  needs to be until all the input data arrays and their offsets have
  been read in. By confining the data arrays to be the same size,
  only the maximum and minimum {$x$} and {$y$} offsets from the central data
  array need be input by the user, then the output image size can be
  worked out from these numbers along with the size of the central
  data array.

  Bad pixels are processed by the magic-value method.

         In general the test points to calculate the co-ordinate limits

      The limits are the lower co-ordinates of the first element, and
      the upper co-ordinates of the last element of the NDF.  Using
      these limits, TRANSFORMER derives the co-ordinates of the output
      NDF\texttt{'}s pixel centres by linear interpolation.  Therefore, the
      co-ordinate limits define the region of the input NDF that will
      appear in the output.

      The bounds of the output NDF define its shape and origin.  So
      an additional linear scaling transformation can be applied along
      each axis by adjusting the shape independently of the co-ordinate
      limits.

         There are some options for setting the characteristics of the
         contour lines.  By default, solid lines are drawn with the same
         colour as the axes and key, namely the foreground colour.  The
         colour will depend on the graphics device chosen, but it is often
         black for printers or white for terminals.  The alternatives to
         override this default behaviour are listed below.

         \begin{enumerate}
         \item Set a colour for all contours using parameter CONCOL.
         \item Request dashed contours below some threshold given by
               parameter DASHED and solid lines for other heights.  All
               contours have either the foreground colour or that
               prescribed by parameter CONCOL.
         \item Cycle the pens modulo 3 for each contour height actually
               plotted by setting PENROT = \texttt{TRUE}.  The characteristics of
               the second and third line styles will depend on the chosen
               graphics device.  An image display or pen plotter will draw
               coloured lines using palette entries 1 to 3; whereas a
               window overlay, or monochrome laser printer or terminal
               will draw a variety of dashed or thicker lines.
         \item Combine options 2 and 3.  However, palette colours 1 to 3
               will always be used and CONCOL ignored.  The contours below
               the threshold continue the cycle through the three colours.
               There may be some confusion on devices that already use
               dashed lines, so this is only suitable for devices
               supporting at least three colours simultaneously.
         \item Annotate the contours using the number of the contour height
               corresponding to the key entries rather than the values
               themselves.  (Set parameter ANNOTA = \texttt{TRUE}.)  The frequency
               of labelling may be defined (LABELFREQ).  The key option
               must be chosen (KEY = \texttt{TRUE}) in conjunction with annotated
               contours.  Annotation is not recommended should the data
               array have a large number of bad pixels, or if the contours
               are closely packed.  There is an additional parameter
               (NOISY) to select double annotations for short or noisy
               contours in option 2.
         \end{enumerate}

         Annotation takes precedence over pen rotation, which in turn
         overrides colour control through CONCOL.

\section{\xlabel{ap_IMAGEformat}IMAGE data format\label{ap:IMAGEformat}}

The IMAGE format as used by some of {\footnotesize KAPRH} is a simple
\HDSref\ structure, comprising a floating-point data array, a character title,
and the maximum and minimum data values.  It is variant of the
original Wright-Giddings IMAGE structure.  There are others is use
that contain more items. An example structure is shown schematically
below using the \HDSTRACEref\latex{ (SUN/102)} notation; see
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:NDFformat}}{\htmlref{the NDF format}{ap:NDFformat}}.
\begin{verbatim}
   HORSEHEAD  <IMAGE>

      DATA_ARRAY(384,512)  <_REAL>   100.5,102.6,110.1,109.8,105.3,107.6,
                                     ... 123.1,117.3,119,120.5,127.3,108.4
      TITLE          <_CHAR*72>      'KAPPA - Flip'
      DATA_MIN       <_REAL>         28.513
      DATA_MAX       <_REAL>         255.94

   End of Trace.
\end{verbatim}

The DATA\_ARRAY may have up to seven dimensions.
IMAGE structures are associated with parameters like INPIC and OUTPIC.
The TITLE object of new IMAGE structures takes the value of the
parameter OTITLE.  DATA\_MIN and DATA\_MAX are now ignored.

The IMAGE format is not too dissimilar from a \emph{primitive\/} NDF
with no extensions.  Indeed if it did not have DATA\_MAX and DATA\_MIN
it would be a {\it bona fide}\ NDF.  Thus applications that handle the
IMAGE format can follow the rules of \xref{SGP/38}{sgp38}{} and
process it like an NDF.  In effect this means that all extensions are
propagated to output files, and a quality array is propagated where
the processing does not invalidate its values.  IMAGE applications
also handle most \emph{simple\/} NDFs correctly (those where the data
array is an array of numbers at the second level of the hierarchical
structure).  This similarity in formats enables NDF and IMAGE
applications to work in co-operation. Note that the primitive
variant is no longer the norm for NDFs, since for example, it does not
support origin information.
