1 GREYPLOT
Produces a greyscale plot of a 1-d or 2-d NDF.

Usage:

   greyplot in [comp] key [device] mode [pxsize] [pysize] [out]
      { white=? black=?
      { percentiles=?
      { sigmas=?
      mode

Description:

   This application produce a greyscale plot of a 1- or
   2-dimensional NDF, especially for a hardcopy device.  The image
   is usually the data array, but may also be the variance or
   quality.  The plot appears in the current graphics-database
   picture.

   The greyscale plot resides within optional, annotated and
   enumerated axes. An optional key may be drawn to the right of the
   greyscale plot comprising a title and grey blocks annotated with
   the corresponding array value.  There are a number of scaling
   methods to map array values to grey levels in the plot.

   The time to output to hardcopy devices can be quite lengthy
   and generally depends on the size of the greyscale plot.
   Therefore, there are parameters for controlling the size of
   the plot.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 ABSLAB
ABSLAB  =  LITERAL (Read)
   Label for the plot abscissa, in which NCAR fancy founts
   may be embedded when FONT = "NCAR".  This parameter is only
   used when the axes option is selected.  If axis information is
   present the suggested default is the NDF's axis label followed
   by the units, in parentheses.  If an error occurs obtaining
   the label the suggested default is "X". []
3 AXES
AXES = _LOGICAL (Read)
   TRUE if annotated axes are to be drawn around the displayed
   image.  The annotations are either the data co-ordinates from
   the NDF axis components, provided these are present and linear
   and COSYS = "Data"; otherwise pixel co-ordinates are used.
   [FALSE]
3 BADCOL
BADCOL = LITERAL (Read)
   The grey level to give a bad pixel in the display.  There are
   a number of options described below.

     "MAX"       - Black
     "MIN"       - White
     An integer  - The actual 'colour' index.  It is constrained
                   to be between 0 and the maximum colour index
                   available on the device, and so gives a shade
                   of grey.  0 gives the background colour.
     A named     - Uses the named `colour' from the palette, and
     `colour'      if it is not present, the nearest colour from
                   the palette is selected.  The palette contains
                   grey levels at percentages from black to white,
                   e.g. GREY50 is midway between black and white.

   If this application is run on a device that supports colour
   it is possible to mark the bad pixels in colour on the
   greyscale provided BADCOL is an integer between 0 and 15, or
   a named colour.  The bad pixels will remain unaltered if the
   lookup table is manipulated.  The suggested default is the
   current value. [The current value, but equals "MIN" if there
   is no current value.]
3 BLACK
BLACK = _DOUBLE (Read)
   The array value that scales to the black in the greyscale
   colour table.  All smaller array values appear black when
   BLACK is less than WHITE, otherwise all array values
   smaller than BLACK appear white.  The dynamic default is the
   minimum data value.   There is an efficiency gain when both
   BLACK and WHITE are given on the command line, because the
   extreme values need not be computed.  (Scale mode)
3 COMP
COMP = LITERAL (Read)
   The NDF component to be displayed.  It may be "Data",
   "Quality", "Variance", or "Error" (where "Error" is the
   alternative to "Variance" and causes the square root of the
   variance values to be displayed).  If "Quality" is specified,
   then the quality values are treated as numerical values (in
   the range 0 to 255). ["Data"]
3 COSYS
COSYS = LITERAL (Read)
   The co-ordinate system to be used.  This can be either "World"
   or "Data".  "World" makes pixel co-ordinates to appear on axes.
   If COSYS = "Data" the NDF's axis information is used to
   annotate axes.  [Current co-ordinate system]
3 DEVICE
DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
   The name of the graphics device used to display the image.
   The device must be in one of the following GNS categories:
   IMAGE_DISPLAY, IMAGE_OVERLAY, MATRIX_PRINTER, or WINDOW, and
   have at least 24 greyscale intensities.
   [Current image-display device]
3 FILL
FILL = _LOGICAL (Read)
   The greyscale plot normally has square pixels, in other words
   a length along each axis corresponds to the same number of
   pixels.  However, for images with markedly different
   dimensions, such as two-dimensional spectra, this default
   behaviour may not be suitable or give the clearest plot.  When
   FILL is TRUE, the square-pixel constraint is relaxed and the
   greyscale plot is the largest possible within the current
   picture.  When FILL is FALSE, the pixels are square.  The
   suggested default is the current value.  [FALSE]
3 FONT
FONT = LITERAL (Read)
   The fount to be used for the line graphics.  It can be either
   "NCAR" for the NCAR fancy characters and "GKS" for the standard
   GKS san-serif fount.   The former is intended for hardcopy
   publication-quality plots, since it is relatively slow; the
   latter is intended for normal interactive graphics requiring
   rapid plotting, and it is clearer on small plots. The
   suggested default is the current value. ["GKS"]
3 FULL
FULL = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE, the whole greyscale lookup table for the device is
   used including the normally reserved pens.  Thus all but two
   of the available intensities participate in the greyscale,
   which improves the photographic quality of the image.  The
   remaining pens are for the background, and for the key and
   axes.  This option is only available for devices that reset
   their `colour' tables when the device is opened, such as
   Laserprinters. (This restriction prevents problems on devices
   that retain their "colour tables", where using the normally
   reserved pens would mean that either part of the greyscale
   would be emphemeral---departing when the application
   completes if the reserved pens are stored and reinstated on
   completion, or earlier plots drawn by other applications would
   be altered.)

   If FULL = FALSE, only non-reserved intensities will form the
   greyscale.  The default is TRUE when the non-reserved pens
   is less than 32, and FALSE otherwise.  (This figure was chosen
   because it is roughly the number of grey levels at which the
   eye will clearly detect the quantisation in a complex scene.)
   []
3 IN
IN = NDF (Read)
   Input NDF data structure containing the image to be displayed.
3 KEY
KEY = _LOGICAL (Read)
   A key of the greyscale versus pixel value and title is to be
   produced when this is TRUE. [TRUE]
3 MAJTIC
MAJTIC( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
   The parameter controlling the numbers of major tick marks
   for the x and y axes.  (Number used is between MAJTIC+2 and
   5*MAJTIC/2+4.)   A negative value for an axis makes the
   graphics package decide an appropriate value.  This parameter
   is only used when the axes option is selected. [3.,3.]
3 MINTIC
MINTIC( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
   The number of minor tick marks between each major tick mark
   for the x and y axes.  A negative value forces the graphics
   package to compute appropriate values.   This parameter is
   only used when the axes option is selected. [-1.,-1.]
3 MODE
MODE = LITERAL (Read)
   The type of scaling to be applied to the array.  There are a
   number of options described below.
     "Faint"       - The image is scaled from the mean minus one
                     standard deviation to the mean plus seven
                     standard deviations.  The scaling values are
                     reported so that the faster Scale mode may be
                     utilised later.
     "Flash"       - The image is flashed onto the screen without
                     any scaling at all.  This is the fastest
                     option.  Since there is no longer a
                     one-to-one mapping between data values and
                     grey levels this scaling mode is not
                     available with a key.
     "Percentiles" - The image is scaled between the values
                     corresponding to two percentiles.  The
                     scaling values are reported so that the
                     faster Scale mode may be utilised later.
     "Range"       - The image is scaled between the minimum and
                     maximum data values.
     "Scale"       - You define the upper and lower limits
                     between which the image is to be scaled.  The
                     application reports the maximum and the
                     minimum values for reference and makes these
                     defaults respectively.
     "Sigmas"      - The image is scaled between two standard-
                     deviation limits.  The scaling values used
                     are reported so that the faster Scale mode
                     may be utilised later.
3 NUMBIN
NUMBIN  =  _INTEGER (Read)
   The number of histogram bins used to compute percentiles for
   scaling. (Percentiles mode) [2048]
3 ORDLAB
ORDLAB  =  LITERAL (Read)
   Label for the plot ordinate, in which NCAR fancy founts
   may be embedded when FONT = "NCAR".   This parameter is only
   used when the axes option is selected.  If axis information is
   present the suggested default is the NDF's axis label followed
   by the units, in parentheses.  If an error occurs obtaining
   the label the suggested default is "Y". []
3 OUT
OUT = NDF (Write)
   The scaled NDF that is displayed; it also does not have
   values that equal the reserved portion of the colour table.
   The output NDF is intended to be used as the input data in
   conjunction with SCALE=FALSE.  It will be vertically
   inverted with respect to the input array because of GKS
   convention.  If it has a null value (!) no output NDF will be
   created.  This parameter is ignored when SCALE=FALSE. [!]
3 OUTTIC
OUTTIC = _LOGICAL (Read)
   True if the axis tick marks are to appear on the outside of
   the axes instead of inside.   This parameter is only used
   when the axes option is selected. [TRUE]
3 PERCENTILES
PERCENTILES( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
   The percentiles that define the scaling limits. For example,
   [75,25] would scale between the quartile values. (Percentile
   mode)
3 PLTITL
PLTITL = LITERAL (Read)
   The title of the plot.  Up to about 25 characters can be
   accommodated when there are no axes, and about 40 otherwise.
   NCAR fancy founts may be embedded (cf. SUN/90) when FONT =
   "NCAR".  This parameter is only used when either the axes or
   key option is selected. [The NDF title]
3 PXSIZE
PXSIZE = _REAL (Read)
   The length (x axis) of the plot in metres.  [Maximum that can
   fit in the current picture whilst preserving square pixels.]
3 PYSIZE
PYSIZE = _REAL (Read)
   The length (y axis) of the plot in metres.  [Maximum that can
   fit in the current picture whilst preserving square pixels.]
3 REDUCT
REDUCT = _REAL (Read)
   The reduction factor of the array, and must be in the range
   1/MAX(NX,NY)--1.0, where NX and NY are the number of pixels
   in the image along the x and y directions.  Since the output
   to the hardcopy device may be long, the size of the image
   with respect to the key can be reduced by lowering REDUCT.
   The spooling time goes approximately proportional to the
   square of REDUCT.  1.0 means the array fills the plotting zone.
   [1.0]
3 SCAHIGH
SCAHIGH = _DOUBLE (Write)
   The array value scaled to white in the greyscale display.
   In Flash mode or when there is no scaling the colour index of
   white is used.  The current display linear-scaling maximum is
   set to this value.
3 SCALE
SCALE = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE the input array is scaled according to the value of
   parameter MODE.  If it is FALSE, MODE is ignored, and the input
   array is displayed as is.  There is no scaling, inversion
   or avoidance of annotation pens.  SCALE=FALSE is intended to
   be used with arrays previously scaled by this or similar
   applications which have already performed the scaling,
   inversion and exclusion.  It provides the quickest method of
   image display within this application. [TRUE]
3 SCALOW
SCALOW = _DOUBLE (Write)
   The array value scaled to black in the greyscale display.
   In Flash mode or when there is no scaling the colour index of
   black is used.  The current display linear-scaling minimum is
   set to this value.
3 SIGMAS
SIGMAS( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
   The standard-deviation bounds that define the scaling limits.
   To obtain values either side of the mean both a negative and
   a positive value are required.  Thus [-2,3] would scale
   between the mean minus two and the mean plus three standard
   deviations.  [3,-2] would give the negative of that. (Sigmas
   mode).
3 THICK
THICK = _REAL (Read)
   The thickness of the axes and annotations in the plot, where
   1.0 is the normal thickness.  It should be between 0.5 and 5.
   This feature is only available on some devices.   This
   parameter is only used when the axes option is selected. [1.0]
3 WHITE
WHITE = _DOUBLE (Read)
   The array value that scales to white in the greyscale
   colour table.  All larger array values appear white when
   WHITE is greater than BLACK, otherwise all array values
   larger than WHITE appear black.  The dynamic default is the
   maximum data value.   There is an efficiency gain when both
   BLACK and WHITE are given on the command line, because the
   extreme values need not be computed.  (Scale mode)
2 Examples
greyplot sdor key mode=sc black=1 white=5.2
   Makes a greyscale display of the data component of the NDF
   called sdor on the current image-display device, scaling
   between 1 and 5.2.  Values up to 1.0 in the data array will
   appear black in the plot, and values larger than 5.2 will be
   white.  Intermediate values will a grey level determined by
   linear interpolation.  A key is drawn to the right of the
   greyscale.

greyplot in=sdor nokey mode=p percentiles=[10,90] badcol="Black"
   This makes a greyscale plot of the NDF called sdor on the
   current image-display device. The scaling is between the 10 and
   90 per cent percentiles of the image.  No key is drawn.  Bad
   data appear black in the plot.

greyplot mode=fa axes out=video cosys=d \
   Displays a greyscale of the current NDF data component with
   annotated axes on the current image-display device.  The axes
   take the axis labels and title from the NDF, and are annotated
   in data co-ordinates.  The scaling is between the -1 and +7
   standard deviations of the image around its mean.  A key is
   drawn.  The scaled data are stored in an NDF called video.

greyplot video noscale \
   Displays the data component of the NDF called video (created
   in the previous example) without scaling within the current
   picture on the current image-display device.

greyplot cgs4k v key mode=ra device=canon_l
   Makes a greyscale display of the variance component of NDF
   cgs4k on the Canon_l device, scaling between the minimum and
   maximum variance values.
2 Notes
-  The application stores a number of pictures in the graphics
database in the following order: a FRAME of the specified size
containing the title, annotated axes, and the image area
(provided AXES is TRUE), whose world co-ordinates are in pixels;
a DATA picture with world co-ordinates in units of data pixels;
and a KEY.  The DATA picture also may have double-precision data
co-ordinates derived from the NDF axis component provided these
are linear and different from pixel co-ordinates; the data
co-ordinates are stored via a linear transformation.  The NDF
associated with the plot is stored by reference with the DATA
picture.  On exit the current database picture for the chosen
device reverts to the input picture.

-  When axes are requested the axis annotations are defined by
their lower and upper bounds, i.e. a regular array is assumed.
The bounds are in pixel or data co-ordinates.

-  The data type of the output NDF depends on the number of colour
indices: _UBYTE for no more than 256, _UWORD for 257 to 65535,
and _INTEGER otherwise.   The output NDF will not contain any
extensions, UNITS, QUALITY, and VARIANCE; but LABEL, TITLE, and
AXIS information are propagated from the input NDF.  The output
NDF does not become the new current data array.  It is a Simple
NDF (because the bad-pixel flag is set to false in order to
access the maximum grey level), therefore only NDF-compliant
applications can process it.

   -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
   VARIANCE, LABEL, TITLE, WCS and UNITS components of the input NDF.

   -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
   supported.

   -  This application will handle data in all numeric types, though
   type conversion to integer will occur for unsigned byte and word
   images.  However, when there is no scaling only integer data will
   not be type converted, but this is not expensive for the expected
   byte-type data.

      krhhelp application/topic subtopic
         This lists help about a subtopic of the specified
         application or topic. The hierarchy of topics has a maximum
         of four levels.

   See the Section "Navigating the Help Library" for details how to
   move around the help information, and to select the topics you
   want to view.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 TOPIC
TOPIC = LITERAL (Read)

2 Navigating_the_Help_Library
   The help information is arranged hierarchically.  You can move
   around the help information whenever KRHHELP prompts.  This
   occurs when it has either presented a screen's worth of text or
   has completed displaying the previously requested help.  The
   information displayed by KRHHELP on a particular topic includes a
   description of the topic and a list of subtopics that further
   describe the topic.

   At a prompt you may enter:
      o  a topic and/or subtopic name(s) to display the help for that
         topic or subtopic, so for example, "greyplot parameters full"
         gives help on FULL, which is a subtopic of Parameters, which
         in turn is a subtopic of GREYPLOT;

      o  a <CR> to see more text at a "Press RETURN to continue ..."
         request;

      o  a <CR> at topic and subtopic prompts to move up one level
         in the hierarchy, and if you are at the top level it will
         terminate the help session;

      o  a CTRL/D (pressing the CTRL and D keys simultaneously) in
         response to any prompt will terminate the help session;

      o  a question mark "?" to redisplay the text for the current
         topic, including the list of topic or subtopic names; or

      o  an ellipsis "..." to display all the text below the
         current point in the hierarchy.  For example, "GREYPLOT..."
         displays information on the GREYPLOT topic as well as
         information on all the subtopics under GREYPLOT.

   You can abbreviate any topic or subtopic using the following
   rules.

      o  Just give the first few characters, e.g. "PARA" for
         Parameters.

      o  Some topics are composed of several words separated by
         underscores.  Each word of the keyword may be abbreviated,
         e.g. "Colour_Set" can be shortened to "C_S".

      o  The characters "%" and "*" act as wildcards, where the
         percent sign matches any single character, and asterisk
         matches any sequence of characters.  Thus to display
         information on all available topics, type an asterisk in
         reply to a prompt.

      o  If a word contains, but does end with an asterisk wildcard,
         it must not be truncated.

      o  The entered string must not contain leading or embedded
         spaces.

   Ambiguous abbreviations result in all matches being displayed.
