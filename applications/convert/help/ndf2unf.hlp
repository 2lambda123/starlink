1 NDF2UNF
Writes an NDF to an unformatted file.

Usage:

   NDF2UNF IN OUT [COMP] [NOPEREC]

Description:

   This application converts an NDF to a sequential unformatted
   file.  Only one of the array components may be copied to the
   output file.  Preceding the data there is an optional header
   consisting of either the FITS extension with the values of
   certain keywords replaced by information derived from the NDF, or
   a minimal FITS header also derived from the NDF.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 COMP
COMP = LITERAL (Read)
   The NDF component to be copied.  It may be "Data", "Quality"
   or "Variance". ["Data"]
3 FITS
FITS = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If true, any FITS extension is written to start of the output
   file, unless there is no extension whereupon a minimal FITS
   header is written to the unformatted file. [FALSE]
3 IN
IN = NDF (Read)
   Input NDF data structure.
3 NOPEREC
NOPEREC = _INTEGER (Read)
   The number of data values per record of the output file.  It
   should be in the range 1 to 8191, unless the array is double
   precision, when the upper limit is 4095.  The suggested
   default is the current value. [The first dimension of the NDF]
3 OUT
OUT = FILENAME (Write)
   Name of the output sequential unformatted file.  The file will
   normally have variable-length records when there is a header,
   but always fixed-length records when there is no header.  It
   has a default file extension of ".DAT".
2 Examples
NDF2UNF CLUSTER CLUSTER.DAT
   This copies the data array of the NDF called CLUSTER to an
   unformatted file called CLUSTER.DAT.  The number of data values
   per record is equal to the size of the first dimension of the
   NDF.

NDF2UNF CLUSTER CLUSTER.DAT V
   This copies the variance of the NDF called CLUSTER to an
   unformatted file called CLUSTER.DAT.  The number of variance
   values per record is equal to the size of the first dimension
   of the NDF.

NDF2UNF CLUSTER CLUSTER.DAT NOPEREC=12
   This copies the data array of the NDF called CLUSTER to an
   unformatted file called CLUSTER.DAT.  There are twelve data
   values per record in CLUSTER.DAT.

NDF2UNF OUT=NDF234.DAT FITS IN=@234
   This copies the data array of the NDF called 234 to an
   unformatted file called NDF234.DAT.  The number of data values
   per record is equal to the size of the first dimension of the
   NDF.  If there is a FITS extension, it is copied to NDF234.DAT
   with substitution of certain keywords, otherwise a minimal
   FITS header is produced.
2 Notes
The details of the conversion are as follows:

   -  the NDF array as selected by COMP is written to the
   unformatted file in records following an optional header.

   -  HISTORY is not propagated.

   -  ORIGIN information is lost.

   - When a header is to be made, it is composed of FITS-like card
   images as follows:

      -  The number of dimensions of the data array is written
      to the keyword NAXIS, and the actual dimensions to NAXIS1,
      NAXIS2 etc. as appropriate.

      -  If the NDF contains any linear axis structures the
      information necessary to generate these structures is
      written to the FITS-like headers. For example, if a linear
      AXIS(1) structure exists in the input NDF the value of the
      first data point is stored with the keyword CRVAL1,
      and the incremental value between successive axis data is
      stored in keyword CDELT1. If there is an axis label it is
      written to keyword CRTYPE1, and axis unit is written to
      CTYPE1.  (Similarly for AXIS(2) structures etc.) FITS does
      not have a standard method of storing axis widths and
      variances, so these NDF components will not be propagated
      to the header.  Non-linear axis data arrays cannot be
      represented by CRVALn and CDELTn, and must be ignored.

      -  If the input NDF contains TITLE, LABEL or UNITS
      components these are stored with the keywords TITLE, LABEL
      or BUNITS respectively.

      -  If the input NDF contains a FITS extension, the FITS
      items may be written to the FITS-like header, with the
      following exceptions:
         o  BITPIX is derived from the type of the NDF data array,
         and so it is not copied from the NDF FITS extension.
         o  NAXIS, and NAXISn are derived from the dimensions of
         the NDF data array as described above, so these items
         are not copied from the NDF FITS extension.
         o  The TITLE, LABEL, and BUNITS descriptors are only
         copied if no TITLE, LABEL, and UNITS NDF components
         respectively have already been copied into these
         headers.
         o  The CDELTn, CRVALn, CTYPEn, and CRTYPEn descriptors
         in the FITS extension are only copied if the input NDF
         contained no linear axis structures.
         o  The standard order of the FITS keywords is preserved,
         thus BITPIX, NAXIS and NAXISn appear immediately after
         the first card image, which should be SIMPLE.
         o  BSCALE and BZERO in a FITS extension are copied when
         BITPIX is positive, i.e. the array is not floating-point.

      -  An extra header record with keyword UNSIGNED and logical
      value T is added when the array data type is one of the HDS
      unsigned integer types.  This is done because standard FITS
      does not support unsigned integers, and allows (in
      conjunction with BITPIX) applications reading the
      unformatted file to determine the data type of the array.

      -  The last header record card will be the standard FITS
      END.

   -  Other extensions are not propagated.
