      SUBROUTINE NDF2ASCII( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDF2ASCII

*  Purpose:
*     Converts an NDF to a text file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDF2ASCII( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application converts an NDF to a Fortran formatted text
*     file.  Only one of the array components may be copied to the
*     output file.  Preceding the data there is an optional header
*     consisting of either the FITS extension with the values of
*     certain keywords replaced by information derived from the NDF, or
*     a minimal FITS header also derived from the NDF.  The output file
*     uses LIST carriagecontrol.

*  Usage:
*     ndf2ascii in out [comp] [reclen] noperec=?

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The NDF component to be copied.  It may be "Data", "Quality"
*        or "Variance". ["Data"]
*     FITS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, any FITS extension is written to start of the output
*        file, unless there is no extension whereupon a minimal FITS
*        header is written to the text file. [FALSE]
*     FIXED = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        When FIXED is TRUE, the output file allocates a fixed number
*        of characters per data value.  The number of characters chosen
*        is the minimum that prevents any loss of precision, and hence
*        is dependent on the data type of the NDF array.  These widths
*        in characters for each HDS data type are as follows: _UBYTE, 3;
*        _BYTE, 4; _UWORD, 5; _WORD, 6; _INTEGER, 11; _REAL, 16; and
*        _DOUBLE, 24.  The record length is the product of the number
*        of characters per value plus one (for a delimiting space),
*        times the number of values per record given by parameter
*        NOPEREC, up to a maximum of 512.

*        When FIXED is FALSE, data values are packed as efficiently as
*        possible within each record.  The length of each record is
*        given by parameter RECLEN.  [FALSE]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        Input NDF data structure. The suggested default is the current
*        NDF if one exists, otherwise it is the current value.
*     NOPEREC = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of data values per record of the output file, when
*        FIXED is TRUE.  It should be positive on UNIX platforms.
*        The suggested default is the current value, or 8 when there
*        is not one.  The upper limit is given by 512 divided by the
*        number of characters per value plus 1 (see parameter FIXED).
*     OUT = FILENAME (Write)
*        Name of the output formatted Fortran file.  The file will
*        normally have variable-length records when there is a header,
*        but always fixed-length records when there is no header.
*     RECLEN = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The maximum record length in bytes (characters) of the output
*        file.  This has a maximum length of 512 (for efficiency
*        reasons), and must be greater than 31 on UNIX systems.  The
*        lower limit is further increased to 80 when there is a FITS
*        header to be copied.  It is only used when FIXED is FALSE and
*        will default to the current value, or 132 if there is no
*        current value.
*        []

*  Examples:
*     ndf2ascii cluster cluster.dat
*        This copies the data array of the NDF called cluster to a text
*        file called cluster.dat.  The maximum recordlength of
*        cluster.dat is 132 bytes, and the data values are packed into
*        these records as efficiently as possible.
*     ndf2ascii cluster cluster.dat v
*        This copies the variance of the NDF called cluster to a text
*        file called cluster.dat.  The maximum recordlength of
*        cluster.dat is 132 bytes, and the variance values are packed
*        into these records as efficiently as possible.
*     ndf2ascii cluster cluster.dat fixed noperec=12
*        This copies the data array of the NDF called cluster to a text
*        file called cluster.dat.  There are twelve data values per
*        record in cluster.dat.
*     ndf2ascii out=ndf234.dat fits reclen=80 in=@234
*        This copies the data array of the NDF called 234 to a text
*        file called ndf234.dat.  The maximum recordlength of
*        ndf234.dat is 80 bytes, and the data values are packed into
*        these records as efficiently as possible.  If there is a FITS
*        extension, it is copied to ndf234.dat with substitution of
*        certain keywords, otherwise a minimal FITS header is produced.

*  Notes:
*     The details of the conversion are as follows:
*        -  the NDF array as selected by COMP is written to the text
*        file in records following an optional header.  When FIXED is
*        FALSE all records are padded out to the recordlength.
*        -  HISTORY is not propagated.
*        -  ORIGIN information is lost.
*
*     When a header is to be made, it is composed of FITS-like card
*     images as follows:
*        -  The number of dimensions of the data array is written 
*        to the keyword NAXIS, and the actual dimensions to NAXIS1,
*        NAXIS2 etc. as appropriate.
*        -  If the NDF contains any linear axis structures the 
*        information necessary to generate these structures is 
*        written to the FITS-like headers. For example, if a linear 
*        AXIS(1) structure exists in the input NDF the value of the 
*        first data point is stored with the keyword CRVAL1,
*        and the incremental value between successive axis data is 
*        stored in keyword CDELT1.  By definition the reference pixel is
*        1.0 and is stored in keyword CRPIX1.  If there is an axis label
*        it is written to keyword CTYPE1, and axis unit is written to
*        CUNIT1.  (Similarly for AXIS(2) structures etc.) FITS does not
*        have a standard method of storing axis widths and variances,
*        so these NDF components will not be propagated to the header.
*        Non-linear axis data arrays cannot be represented by CRVALn
*        and CDELTn, and must be ignored.
*        -  If the input NDF contains TITLE, LABEL or UNITS components
*        these are stored with the keywords TITLE, LABEL or BUNIT
*        respectively.
*        -  If the input NDF contains a FITS extension, the FITS items 
*        may be written to the FITS-like header, with the following 
*        exceptions:
*           o  BITPIX is derived from the type of the NDF data array,
*           and so it is not copied from the NDF FITS extension.
*           o  NAXIS, and NAXISn are derived from the dimensions of the
*           NDF data array as described above, so these items are not
*           copied from the NDF FITS extension.
*           o  The TITLE, LABEL, and BUNIT descriptors are only copied
*           if no TITLE, LABEL, and UNITS NDF components respectively
*           have already been copied into these headers.
*           o  The CDELTn, CRVALn, CTYPEn, CUNITn, and CRTYPEn
*           descriptors in the FITS extension are only copied if the
*           input NDF contained no linear axis structures.
*           o  The standard order of the FITS keywords is preserved,
*           thus BITPIX, NAXIS and NAXISn appear immediately after the
*           first card image, which should be SIMPLE.
*           o  BSCALE and BZERO in a FITS extension are copied when
*           BITPIX is positive, i.e. the array is not floating-point.
*        -  An extra header record with keyword UNSIGNED and logical
*        value T is added when the array data type is one of the HDS
*        unsigned integer types.  This is done because standard FITS
*        does not support unsigned integers, and allows (in conjunction
*        with BITPIX) applications reading the text file to determine
*        the data type of the array.
*        -  The last header record card will be the standard FITS END.
*        -  Other extensions are not propagated.

*     CONVERT: ASCII2NDF; KAPPA: TRANDAT; FIGARO: ASCIN and ASCOUT.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types are supported.
*     -  The value of bad pixels is not written to a FITS-like header
*     record with keyword BLANK.
