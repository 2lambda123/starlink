      SUBROUTINE COF_NHEAD( FUNIT, FILE, NCARD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_NHEAD

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains the number of FITS headers in the current HDU.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_NHEAD( FUNIT, FILE, NCARD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine merely obtains the number of FITS headers in the
*     current header and data unit.  It takes care of any error
*     status.  It exists because this code is needed by many
*     subroutines.

*  Arguments:
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITSIO unit number for the FITS file.
*     FILE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the FITS file or device being converted.  This is
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of FITS header cards in the current HDU.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The FITS file must be open.
