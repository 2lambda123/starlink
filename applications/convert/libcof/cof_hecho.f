      SUBROUTINE COF_HECHO( NLINES, TEXT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_HECHO

*  Purpose:
*     Writes history text to the FITS headers.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_HECHO( NLINES, TEXT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine appends the history text associated with an
*     NDF to the current FITS header.  It is not called directly (by
*     COF_WHISR), but is passed as an external argument to routine
*     NDF_HOUT.  (It is an equivalent to NDF_HECHO.  See SUN/33 for
*     more details.)

*  Arguments:
*     NLINES = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lines of history text.
*     TEXT( NLINES ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The history text.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The argument list should not be changed.
*     -  There is no error checking of the FITSIO status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The NDF and the FITS file must already be open.  The current
*     HDU in the FITS file should be the primary and the other headers
*     should have been written.
