      SUBROUTINE COF_STYPC( NDF, COMP, TYPE, DATCOD, ITYPE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_STYPC

*  Purpose:
*     Sets NDF array types from the FITS headers and preferred data
*     type.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_STYPC( NDF, COMP, TYPE, DATCOD, ITYPE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This sets the data type for an NDF array component.  A preferred
*     type value may be used, unless the component is the QUALITY.  The
*     type may also be undefined, in which case the supplied FITS
*     binary-table datacode defines the data type.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF to be converted from the FITS file.
*     COMP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The array component.  It must be 'Data', 'Variance', or
*        'Quality'.  Case is ignored.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The data type of the component.  If this is null, the value of
*        DATCOD defines the data type.  Case is ignored.
*     DATCOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITSIO data-type code from a FITS binary-table header to
*        be used to define the output HDS data type when TYPE = ' '.
*        Thus for example, 42 would generate _REAL, and 21 makes _WORD.
*        See the FITSIO manual for a full list.  Generally, the meaning
*        need not be known, as one merely passes the value returned by
*        FTGTCL into this routine.
*     ITYPE = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZTYP ) (Returned)
*        The data type selected for the component.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Type Definitions:
      IMPLICIT NONE              ! No implicit typing

*  Global Constants:
      INCLUDE 'SAE_PAR'          ! Standard SAE constants

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER NDF
      CHARACTER * ( * ) COMP
      CHARACTER * ( * ) TYPE
      INTEGER DATCOD

*  Arguments Returned:
      CHARACTER * ( * ) ITYPE

*  Status:
      INTEGER STATUS             ! Global status

*  Local Variables:
      CHARACTER * ( 8 ) UCOMP    ! Uppercase form of the supplied
                                 ! component name

*.

*  Check the inherited global status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  Convert supplied component name to uppercase, using a local variable.
      UCOMP = COMP
      CALL CHR_UCASE( UCOMP )

*  Determine the data type of the output array component.  QUALITY
*  arrays must be unsigned byte.
      IF ( UCOMP .EQ. 'QUALITY' ) THEN
         ITYPE = '_UBYTE'

*  A null supplied type means use the data type of the FITS file.
*  Convert the FITSIO datacode into an HDS type.
      ELSE IF ( TYPE .EQ. ' ' ) THEN
         CALL COF_FD2HT( DATCOD, ITYPE, STATUS )

*  Just use the supplied data type.
      ELSE
         ITYPE = TYPE
      END IF

*  Change the type of the component.
      CALL NDF_STYPE( ITYPE, NDF, COMP, STATUS )
