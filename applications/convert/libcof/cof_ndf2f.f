*  Name:
*     COF_NDF2F

*  Purpose:
*     Converts an NDF into a FITS file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_NDF2F( NDF, FILNAM, NOARR, ARRNAM, BITPIX, BLOCKF,
*                     ORIGIN, PROFIT, DUPLEX, PROEXT, PROHIS, PROVEN,
*                     SUMS, ENCOD, NATIVE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine converts an NDF into a FITS file.  It uses as much
*     standard NDF information as possible to define the headers.  See
*     The Notes for the details.  Multiple NDF container files may be
*     converted.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF to be converted to a FITS file.
*     FILNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the output FITS file.
*     NOARR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of NDF arrays to copy.  Where there are no arrays,
*        just a header-only NDF is to be written to the
*        current header and data unit of the FITS file, do not set this
*        to zero, as it is used for the adjustable array ARRNAM; instead
*        specify NOARR=1 and and set ARRNAM to 'HEADER'.
*     ARRNAM( NOARR ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The names (in uppercase) of the NDF array components to write
*        to the FITS file.  These should be in the order to be written.
*        If the DATA component is present it should be first.
*     BITPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of bits per pixel (FITS BITPIX) required for the
*        output FITS file.  In addition there are three special values.
*        A value of 0 means use the BITPIX of the input array.  A value
*        of -1 means use the value of the BITPIX keyword in the NDF's
*        FITS extension; if the extension or BITPIX card is absent, the
*        BITPIX of the input array is used.  BITPIX=1 requests that any
*        scaled arrays in the NDF be copied to the scaled data type.
*        In the absence of a scaled array, behaviour reverts to
*        BITPIX=-1, which may in turn be effectively BITPIX=0.
*     BLOCKF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The blocking factor for the output file.  It must be a positive
*        integer between 1 and 10.
*     ORIGIN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the institution where the FITS file originates.
*        This is used to create the ORIGIN card in the FITS header.
*        A blank value gives a default of "Starlink Project, U.K.".
*     PROFIT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., the contents of the FITS airlock, if present, are
*        merged into the FITS header.  Argument DUPLEX qualifies to
*        which arrays this applies.  Certain cards in this extension
*        are not propagated ever and others may only be propagated when
*        certain standard items are not present in the NDF.  See routine
*        COF_WHEAD for details.
*     DUPLEX = LOGICAL (Give)
*        This qualifies the effect of PROFIT=.TRUE.  A .FALSE. value
*        means that the airlocks headers only appear with the primary
*        array.  Supplying .TRUE., propagates the FITS airlock headers
*        for other array components of the NDF.
*     PROEXT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., the NDF extensions (other than the FITS extension)
*        are propagated to the FITS files as FITS binary-table
*        extensions, one per structure of the hierarchy.
*     PROHIS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., any NDF history records are written to the primary
*        FITS header as HISTORY cards.  These follow the mandatory
*        headers and any merged FITS-extension headers (see PROFIT).
*     PROVEN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        This controls the export of NDF provenance information to the
*        FITS file.  Allowed values are as follows.
*
*        "NONE" -- No provenance is written.
*
*        "CADC" -- The CADC headers are written.  These record the
*        number and paths of both the direct parents of the NDF being
*        converted, and its root ancestors (the ones without parents).
*        Also modify the PRODUCT keyword to be unique for each FITS
*        extension.
*
*        "GENERIC" -- Encapsulates the entire PROVENANCE structure in
*        FITS headers in sets of five character-value indexed headers.
*        There is a set for the current NDF and each parent.
*     SUMS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., DATASUM and CHECKSUM headers are written to each
*        HDU.
*     ENCOD = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The encoding to use. If this is blank, then a default encoding
*        is chosen based on the contents of the FITS extension. The
*        supplied string should be a recognised AST encoding such as
*        'DSS', 'FITS-WCS', 'NATIVE', etc (or a blank string).
*     NATIVE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Should a NATIVE encoding of the WCS info be included in the
*        header?
*     FOPEN = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If TRUE a new FITS file should be opened.
*     FCLOSE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If TRUE a the open FITS file should be closed.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The rules for the conversion of an NDF are as follows:
*     -  The NDF main data array becomes the primary data array of the
*     FITS file if it is in value of parameter COMP, otherwise the first
*     array defined by parameter COMP will become the primary data
*     array.  A conversion from floating point to integer or to a
*     shorter integer type will cause the output array to be scaled and
*     offset, the values being recorded in keywords BSCALE and BZERO.
*     There is an offset (keyword BZERO) applied to signed byte and
*     unsigned word types to make them unsigned-byte and signed-word
*     values respectively in the FITS array (this is because FITS does
*     not support these data types).
*     -  The FITS keyword BLANK records the bad values for integer
*     output types.  Bad values in floating-point output arrays are
*     denoted by IEEE not-a-number values.
*     -  The NDF's quality and variance arrays appear in individual
*     FITS IMAGE extensions immediately following the primary header
*     and data unit, unless that component already appears as the
*     primary data array.  The quality array will always be written as
*     an unsigned-byte array in the FITS file, regardless of the value
*     of the parameter BITPIX.
*     -  Here are details of the processing of standard items from the
*     NDF into the FITS header, listed by FITS keyword.
*        SIMPLE, EXTEND, PCOUNT, GCOUNT --- all take their default
*          values.
*        BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXISn --- are derived directly from the NDF
*          data array; however the BITPIX in the FITS airlock extension
*          is transferred when argument BITPIX is -1.
*        CRVALn, CDELTn, CRPIXn, CTYPEn, CUNITn --- are derived from
*          the NDF axis structures if possible.  If no linear NDF axis
*          structures are present, the values in the NDF's FITS
*          extension are copied (when argument PROFIT is .TRUE.).  If
*          any axes are non-linear, all FITS axis information is lost.
*        OBJECT, LABEL, BUNIT --- the values held in the NDF's title,
*          label, and units components respectively are used if
*          they are defined; otherwise any values found in the FITS
*          extension are used (provided parameter PROFIT is .TRUE.).
*        DATE --- is created automatically.
*        ORIGIN --- inherits any existing ORIGIN card in the NDF FITS
*          extension, unless you supply a value through argument
*          ORIGIN other than the default "Starlink Project, U.K." or
*          a blank string.
*        EXTNAME --- is the component name of the object from the COMP
*          argument when the EXTNAME appears in the primary header or
*          an IMAGE extension.  In a binary-table derived from an NDF
*          extension, EXTNAME is the path of the extension within the
*          NDF.  If the component is too long to fit within the header
*          (68 characters), EXTNAME is set to  '@EXTNAMEF'.  The full
*          path is then stored in keyword EXTNAMEF using the HEASARC
*          Long-string CONTINUE convention
*          (http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/continue_keyword.html).
*        EXTVER --- is only set when EXTNAME (q.v.) cannot accommodate
*          the component name and is assigned the HDU index to provide a
*          unique identifier.
*        EXTLEVEL --- is the level in the hierarchical structure of the
*          extensions.  Thus a top-level extension has value 1,
*          sub-components of this extension have value 2 and so on.
*        EXTTYPE --- is the data type of the NDF extension used to
*          create a binary table.
*        HDUCLAS1, HDUCLASn --- "NDF" and the value of COMP
*          respectively.
*        LBOUNDn --- is the pixel origin for the nth dimension when
*          any of the pixel origins is not equal to 1.  (This is not a
*          standard FITS keyword.)
*        XTENSION, BSCALE, BZERO, BLANK and END --- are not propagated
*          from the NDF's FITS extension.  XTENSION will be set for
*          any extension.  BSCALE and BZERO will be defined based on
*          the chosen output data type in comparison with the NDF
*          array's type, but cards with values 1.0 and 0.0 respectively
*          are written to reserve places in the header section.  These
*          `reservation' cards are for efficiency and they can always
*          be deleted later.  BLANK is set to the Starlink standard bad
*          value corresponding to the type specified by the BITPIX
*          keyword, but only for integer types and not for the quality
*          array.  It appears regardless of whether or not there are
*          bad values actually present in the array; this is for the
*          same efficiency reasons as before.  The END card terminates
*          the FITS header.  The END card is written by FITSIO
*          automatically once the header is closed.
*        HISTORY cards are propagated from the FITS airlock when
*          PROFIT is .TRUE., and from the NDF HISTORY component when
*          PROHIS is .TRUE..
*        DATASUM and CHECKSUM --- are written afresh when argument
*          SUMS is TRUE, otherwise any existing values inherited from
*          the FITS airlock are removed.
*
*     -  The following PROVENANCE headers are written if argument PROVEN
*     is set to "GENERIC".
*        PRVPn --- is the path of the nth NDF.
*        PRVIn --- is a comma-separated list of the identifiers of the
*          direct parents for the nth ancestor.
*        PRVDn --- is the creation date in ISO order of the $n$th
*          ancestor.
*        PRVCn --- is the software used to create the nth ancestor.
*        PRVMn --- lists the contents of the MORE structure of the nth
*          parent.
*     All have value '<unknown>' if the information could not be found,
*     except for the PRVMn header, which is omitted if there is no MORE
*     information to record.
*
*     The following PROVENANCE headers are written if argument PROVEN
*     is set to "CADC".
*        PRVCNT --- is the number of immediate parents.
*        PRVm --- is name of the mth immediate parent.
*        OBSCNT --- is the number of root ancestor OBSm headers.
*        OBSm --- is mth root ancestor identifier from its
*          MORE.OBSIDSS component.
*        FILEID --- is the name of the output FITS file, omitting any
*          file extension.
*
*        PRODUCT is modified or added to each extension's header to
*        be the primary header's value of PRODUCT with a '_<extnam>'
*        suffix, where <extnam> is the extension name in lowercase.
*
*     -  There are additional rules if a multi-NDF container file is
*     being converted.  This excludes the case where there are but two
*     NDFs---one data and the other just headers---that have already
*     been merged:
*     -  For multiple NDFs a header-only HDU may be created followed by
*     an IMAGE extension containing the data array (or whichever other
*     array is first specified by COMP).
*     -  BITPIX for the header HDU is set to an arbitrary 8.
*     -  Additional keywords are written for each IMAGE extension.
*        HDSNAME is the NDF name for a component NDF in a multi-NDF
*          container file, for example I2.
*        HDSTYPE is set to "NDF" for a component NDF in a multi-NDF
*          container file.
