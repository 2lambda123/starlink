      SUBROUTINE COF_RHEAD( FUNIT, FILE, NHEAD, MXHEAD, HEADER, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_RHEAD

*  Purpose:
*     Reads the current FITS header into an array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_RHEAD( FUNIT, FILE, NHEAD, MXHEAD, HEADER, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This reads the FITSIO current headers of a FITS file into an
*     array.  This is largely intended for dealing with datasets using
*     the Green Bank convention, where the global informationin the
*     primary headers needs to be merged with columns in a binary table.
*     of a series of observations.

*     array.  Following these, but before the END card, come FITS
*     header cards containing the values of columns of the nominated
*     row of the binary table that have been unused to form the NDF.
*     These additional headers use the TTYPEn values as their keywords.
*     If the primary header array supplied already contains such
*     keywords, the existing values are overwritten.  The headers are
*     then copied verbatim to the extension.

*  Arguments:
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITSIO unit number for the FITS file.
*     FILE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the FITS file or tape device to appear in the
*        error messages.
*     NHEAD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of headers from the HDU.
*     MXHEAD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Maximum number of headers.
*     HEADER( MXHEAD ) = CHARACTER * ( 80 ) (Returned)
*        The NHEAD headers from the HDU, but excluding the END card.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The FITS files must already be opened with the FITSIO library.
