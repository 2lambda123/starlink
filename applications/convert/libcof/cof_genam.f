      SUBROUTINE COF_GENAM( FUNIT, EXTNAM, COMENT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_FT2NE

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains the extension name from a FITS HDU.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_GENAM( FUNIT, EXTNAM, COMENT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine obtains the extension name of a FITS extension.
*     from the EXTNAME keyword.  Should the EXTNAME value have a 
*     redirection to another header, as indicated by the presence
*     of an '@' in its first character, the remainder of the value is
*     interpreted as another KEYWORD.  This is only used when the 
*     extension name is longer than the 68 characters than the EXTNAME
*     keyword can accommodate.

*  Arguments:
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITSIO unit number for the FITS file.
*     EXTNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The extension name.  Adequate space should be allowed.
*        For NDF2FITS-created headers space for up to about 150
*        characters should be sufficient and only very rarely will
*        80 be exceeded.
*     COMENT, = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The comment associated with the extension name's header
*        keyword.  Space should be allowed for up to 48 characters. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The FITS file must be open.
