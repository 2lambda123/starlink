      SUBROUTINE COF_MGHDR( NDF1, NDF2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_MGHDR

*  Purpose:
*     Merges the FITS airlocks of two NDFs

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_MGHDR( NDF1, NDF2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine serves NDF2FITS.  It merges the FITS airlocks of
*     two NDFs in the first NDF supplied.  The routine first stores any 
*     headers in the first NDF airlock.  Then it replaces the first 
*     airlock with the second NDF's FITS airlock.  It finally inserts
*     any original headers from the first NDF just before the END card,
*     or appendss the headers should there be no END card.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the primary NDF that will be updated with
*        the merged FITS airlocks.  This NDF must have update access.
*     NDF2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the second NDF whose FITS airlock is to be
*        merged.  This will usually be a header-only NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is no check for duplicated keywords.
