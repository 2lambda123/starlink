      SUBROUTINE COF_IUEQ( EL, IUEQUA, QUALIT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_IUEQ

*  Purpose:
*     Converts IUEFA 16-bit quality to NDF quality.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_IUEQ( EL, IUEQUA, QUALIT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routines takes IUE Final Archive quality information
*     stored at 2's complement 16-bit integers, into unsigned-byte
*     quality as required by the NDF.  The most significant 8 bits of
*     the 14 actually used are transferred.  In practice this means a
*     division by -128.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in the quality arrays.
*     IUEQUA( EL ) = INTEGER * 2 (Given)
*        The IUE Final Archive quality array.
*     QUALIT( EL ) = BYTE (Returned)
*        The NDF quality array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
