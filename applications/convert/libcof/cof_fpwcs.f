      SUBROUTINE COF_FPWCS( FUNIT, INDF, ENCOD, NATIVE, USEAXS,
     :                      ALWTAB, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_FPWCS

*  Purpose:
*     Uses co-ordinate system information from the NDF WCS component
*     to create FITS headers in the current header and data unit.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_FPWCS( FUNIT, INDF, ENCOD, NATIVE, USEAXS, ALWTAB,
*                     STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The AST FrameSet (see SUN/210) describing the co-ordinate systems
*     of the supplied NDF is obtained. Any Frames that can be generated
*     automatically are removed from this FrameSet (i.e. the PIXEL
*     Frame, and also the AXIS Frame if it is equivalent to the PIXEL
*     Frame). If more than one Frame (i.e. the GRID frame) remains, a
*     FITS header is created containing desriptions (known as
*     "encodings") of the FrameSet.

*  Arguments:
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITSIO unit number to which the FITS header cards are
*         written.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     ENCOD = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The encoding to use. If this is blank, then a default encoding
*        is chosen based on the contents of the FITS extension. The
*        supplied string should be a recognised AST encoding such as
*        'DSS', 'FITS-WCS', 'NATIVE', etc. (or a blank string).
*     NATIVE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Include a NATIVE encoding in the header?
*     USEAXS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Whether or not to export AXIS co-ordinates to an alternate
*        world co-ordinate representation in the FITS headers.  Such an
*        alternate may require a FITS extension to store lookup tables
*        of co-ordinates using the -TAB projection type.  The allowed
*        options are as follows.
*
*        "CHECK" --- requests no AXIS information be stored unless the
*                    current NDF contains AXIS information but no WCS.
*        "YES"   --- May create an alternate world co-ordinate
*                    representation irrespective of how the current
*                    NDF stores co-ordinate information.
*        "NO"    --- Must not create an alternate world co-ordinate
*                    representation in the current NDF.
*     ALWTAB = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If TRUE, then WCS co-ordinates in tabular form may be written
*        using the TAB algorithm as defined in FITS WCS Paper III.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The FITS file must already be opened with the FITSIO library.

*        overheads.
*     20-JAN-2011 (DSB):
*        - Increase the value of the FitsDigits attribute from 10 to 15
*        to get sub-second accuracy on MJD-OBS.

*     15-NOV-2013 (DSB):
*        Restructured slightly to ensure any junk WCS-related keywords
*        that are present in the header on entry are deleted on exit, even
*        if the NDF contains no WCS.
