*  Name:
*     COF_SMURF

*  Purpose:
*     Converts a SMURF extension into FITS extensions.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_SMURF( SNAME, LOC, FUNIT, NDF, FILNAM, NOARR, ARRNAM,
*                     BITPIX, BLOCKF, ORIGIN, PROFIT, DUPLEX, PROEXT,
*                     PROHIS, ENCOD, NATIVE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine converts contents of a SMURF extension to FITS.  Each
*     NDF is converted in turn in standard fashion.  It is assumed that
*     the NDFs do not contain their own metadata, thus may inherit the
*     metadata in the FITS airlock and HISTORY records from the parent
*     NDF.  Any other components of the structure are converted to a
*     binary table, as in the general case of extension conversion.
*
*     Most of the arguments are merely passed to the routine that
*     converts each NDF within the SMURF extension.

*  Arguments:
*     SNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of structure.  It is used to form the EXTNAME
*        keyword.
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given)
*        Locator to the SMURF extension structure whose contents are to
*        be converted to binary tables.
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The logical unit number of the output FITS file.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the parent NDF.
*     FILNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the output FITS file.
*     NOARR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of NDF arrays to copy.  Where there are no arrays,
*        just a header-only NDF is to be written to the
*        current header and data unit of the FITS file, do not set this
*        to zero, as it is used for the adjustable array ARRNAM; instead
*        specify NOARR=1 and and set ARRNAM to 'HEADER'.
*     ARRNAM( NOARR ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The names (in uppercase) of the NDF array components to write
*        to the FITS file.  These should be in the order to be written.
*        If the DATA component is present it should be first.
*     BITPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of bits per pixel (FITS BITPIX) required for the
*        output FITS file.  In addition there are three special values.
*        A value of 0 means use the BITPIX of the input array.  A value
*        of -1 means use the value of the BITPIX keyword in the NDF's
*        FITS extension; if the extension or BITPIX card is absent, the
*        BITPIX of the input array is used.  BITPIX=1 requests that any
*        scaled arrays in the NDF be copied to the scaled data type.
*        In the absence of a scaled array, behaviour reverts to
*        BITPIX=-1, which may in turn be effectively BITPIX=0.
*     BLOCKF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The blocking factor for the output file.  It must be a positive
*        integer between 1 and 10.
*     ORIGIN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the institution where the FITS file originates.
*        This is used to create the ORIGIN card in the FITS header.
*        A blank value gives a default of "Starlink Project, U.K.".
*     PROFIT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., the contents of the FITS airlock, if present, are
*        merged into the FITS header.  Argument DUPLEX qualifies to
*        which arrays this applies.  Certain cards in this extension
*        are not propagated ever and others may only be propagated when
*        certain standard items are not present in the NDF.  See routine
*        COF_WHEAD for details.
*     DUPLEX = LOGICAL (Give)
*        This qualifies the effect of PROFIT=.TRUE.  A .FALSE. value
*        means that the airlocks headers only appear with the primary
*        array.  Supplying .TRUE., propagates the FITS airlock headers
*        for other array components of the NDF.
*     PROEXT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., the NDF extensions (other than the FITS extension)
*        are propagated to the FITS files as FITS binary-table
*        extensions, one per structure of the hierarchy.
*     PROHIS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., any NDF history records are written to the primary
*        FITS header as HISTORY cards.  These follow the mandatory
*        headers and any merged FITS-extension headers (see PROFIT).
*     SUMS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., DATASUM and CHECKSUM headers are written to each
*        HDU.
*     ENCOD = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The encoding to use. If this is blank, then a default encoding
*        is chosen based on the contents of the FITS extension. The
*        supplied string should be a recognised AST encoding such as
*        'DSS', 'FITS-WCS', 'NATIVE', etc (or a blank string).
*     NATIVE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Should a NATIVE encoding of the WCS info be included in the
*        header?
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  A primary HDU unit exists in the FITS file, and the file is
*     open.
