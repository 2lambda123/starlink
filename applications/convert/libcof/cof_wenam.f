      SUBROUTINE COF_WENAM( FUNIT, EXTNAM, COMENT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_WENAM

*  Purpose:
*     Writes extension-name metadata.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_WENAM( FUNIT, EXTNAM, COMENT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine writes the extension-name metadata for long strings.
*     In most cases this the regular EXTNAME keyword as defined in
*     "Generalized extensions and blocking factors for FITS" by
*     Grosbol et al. 1988, A&A Supp. Ser. 73, 359 will suffice.
*     However, since the full component name can be longer than the 68
*     characters that can be accommodated in the EXTNAME keyword, and
*     it is not good practice to use the long-string CONTINUE convention
*     for mandatory (or reserved) keywords, an alternative approach is
*     needed and is encapsulated in this routine.
*
*     The approach taken for long component names is to create an
*     EXTNAMEF header that uses the Long-string CONTINUE convention
*     (http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/continue_keyword.html) to
*     record the full path.  EXTNAME is reset to '@EXTNAMEF' and
*     keyword EXTVER set to the index of the current HDU.  The latter
*     is required to avoid ambiguity should a user specify an extension
*     by its EXTNAME name.  It also prevents fitsverify from issuing a
*     warning.

*  Arguments:
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The logical unit number of the output FITS file.
*     EXTNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the structure.
*     COMENT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The comment string for the EXTNAM.  If set to a blank string
*        the following default comments will be used depending on the
*        type of extension.
*           Image         "Component"
*           Binary table  "name of this binary-table extension"
*           ASCII table   "name of this ASCII-table extension"
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This will return an error status if the current HDU is not an
*     extension.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  A primary HDU unit exists in the FITS file, and the FITS file
*     is open.
