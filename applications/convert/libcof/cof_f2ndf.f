*  Name:
*     COF_F2NDF

*  Purpose:
*     Converts a FITS file into an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_F2NDF( FILNAM, NDF, LOGHDR, FDL, FMTCNV, USETYP, PROFIT,
*                     PROXTI, CONTNR, NENCOD, ENCODS, WCSATT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine converts a FITS file into an NDF.  It can process an
*     arbitrary FITS file to produce an NDF, using NDF extensions to
*     store information conveyed in table and image components of the
*     FITS file.  While no information is lost, in many common cases
*     this would prove inconvenient especially as no meaning is attached
*     to the NDF extension components.  Therefore, this routine
*     recognises certain data products (currently IUE, ISO, and 2dF),
*     and provides tailored conversions that map the FITS data better
*     on to the NDF.  For instance, an image extension storing data
*     errors will have its data array transferred to the NDF's VARIANCE
*     (after being squared).  In addition, FITS2NDF can restore NDFs
*     converted to FITS by the sister task NDF2FITS.

*     Details of the supported formats and rules for processing them,
*     and the general-case processing rules are described below.

*  Arguments:
*     FILNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the input FITS file or device.  It may include a 
*        FITS extension specifier.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF to be converted from the FITS file.
*     LOGHDR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., a record of the FITS headers is written to a log
*        file given by descriptor FDL.  If .FALSE., no log is made and
*        argument FDL is ignored. 
*     FDL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The file descriptor for the log file.  This is ignored when
*        LOGHDR is .FALSE..  The file should be formatted and have
*        a record length of at least 80 characters.  There is no
*        validation because the record length is machine dependent.
*     FMTCNV = LOGICAL (Given)
*        This specifies whether or not format conversion will occur.
*        The conversion applies the values of the FITS keywords BSCALE
*        and BZERO to the FITS data to generate the "true" data values.
*        This applies to IMAGE extensions, as well as the primary data
*        array.  If BSCALE and BZERO are not given in the FITS header,
*        they are taken to be 1.0 and 0.0 respectively.
*
*        If FMTCNV=.FALSE., the HDS type of the data array in the NDF
*        will be the equivalent of the FITS data format on tape (e.g.
*        BITPIX = 16 creates a _WORD array).  If FMTCNV=.TRUE., the
*        data array in the NDF will be converted from the FITS data
*        type on tape to _REAL or _DOUBLE in the NDF.  The choice of
*        floating-point data type depends on the number of significant
*        digits in the BSCALE and BZERO keywords.
*     USETYP = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Specifies the HDS primitive data type of the NDF data and 
*        variance arrays.  It should be one of the HDS primitive types.
*        This data type overrides the data type of rescaled data (see
*        argument FMTCNV) given by the precision of the BSCALE and BZERO
*        keywords.  Care should be exercised that the chosen type
*        supports the dynamic range of the data, especially if 
*        FMTCNV=.TRUE.
*     PROFIT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., the FITS headers are written to the NDF's FITS
*        extension. 
*     PROXTI = LOGICAL (Given)
*        This governs how any extension (here called a sub-file) within
*        the FITS file are processed in the general case.  If .TRUE.,
*        any FITS sub-file is propagated to the NDF as an NDF extension
*        called FITS_EXT_n, where n is the number of the extension.  If
*        .FALSE., any FITS-file extensions are ignored.  The "Notes"
*        of the general conversion contain details of where and in what
*        form the various FITS extensions are stored in the NDF.
*
*        This parameter is ignored when the supplied FITS file is one
*        of the special formats whose structure in terms of multiple
*        FITS objects is defined.  Specialist NDF extensions may be
*        created in this case.  See topic "Special Formats" for
*        references where to find more details.
*     CONTNR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If TRUE causes each HDU from the FITS file to be written as
*        a component of an HDS container file.  Each component will be
*        named HDU_n, where n is the FITS HDU number.  The primary HDU
*        is numbered 0.  If the FITS HDU contains a data array, the HDS
*        component will be an NDF; if not, it will be a structure of
*        type FITS_HEADER containing the FITS header as an array of type
*        _CHAR*80.
*     NENCOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of encodings supplied in ENCODS.
*     ENCODS( NENCOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The preferred AST encodings to use when creating the NDF WCS
*        component, in order of preference (most preferable first). 
*        It is ignored if NENCOD is zero.
*     WCSATT = CARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Attribute settings for the WCS FitsChan.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Some sources of FITS files that require special conversion
*     rules, particularly because they use binary tables, are
*     recognised.  Details of the processing for these is given within
*     topic "Special Formats".  Both NDF and FITS use the term
*     extension, and they mean different things.  Thus to avoid
*     confusion in the descriptions below, the term `sub-file' is used
*     to refer to a FITS IMAGE, TABLE or BINTABLE extension.
*
*     The general rules for the conversion apply if the FITS file is not
*     one of the "Special Formats" (including one defined by an EXTABLE)
*     and parameter CONTAINER is not TRUE.
*
*     The general rules are as follows.
*
*     -  The primary data array of the FITS file becomes the NDF's data
*     array.  There is an option using parameter FMTCNV to convert
*     integer data to floating point using the values of FITS keywords
*     BSCALE and BZERO.
*     -  Any integer array elements with value equal to the FITS
*     keyword BLANK become bad values in the NDF data array.  Likewise
*     any floating-point data set to an IEEE not-a-number value also
*     become bad values in the NDF's data array.  The BAD_PIXEL flag is
*     set appropriately.
*     -  NDF quality and variance arrays are not created.
*     -  A verbatim copy of the FITS primary header is placed in the
*     NDF's FITS extension when parameter PROFITS is TRUE.
*     -  Here are details of the processing of standard items from the
*     the FITS header, listed by FITS keyword.
*        CRVALn, CDELTn, CRPIXn, CTYPEn, CUNITn --- define the NDF's
*          WCS component. 
*        OBJECT, LABEL, BUNIT --- if present are equated to the NDF's
*          title, label, and units components respectively.
*        LBOUNDn --- if present, this specifies the pixel origin for
*          the nth dimension.
*     -  Additional sub-files within the FITS files are converted into
*     extensions within the NDF if parameter PROEXTS is TRUE.  These
*     extensions are named FITS_EXT_m for the mth sub-file.
*     -  An IMAGE sub-file is treated like the primary data array, and
*     follows the rules give above.  However, the resultant NDF is an
*     extension of the main NDF.
*     -  A BINTABLE or TABLE sub-file are converted into a structure
*     of type TABLE ().  This has a NROWS component specifying the
*     number of rows, and a COLUMNS structure containing a series of
*     further structures, each of which has has the name of the
*     corresponding column in the FITS table.  These COLUMN structures
*     contain a column of table data values in component DATA,
*     preserving the original data type; and optional UNITS and COMMENT
*     components which specify the column's units and the meaning of
*     the column.  Thus for example, for the third sub-file of NDF
*     called ABC, the data for column called RA would be located in
*     ABC.MORE.FITS_EXT_3.COLUMNS.RA.DATA.
*     -  A random-group FITS file creates an NDF for each group.  As
*     they are related observations the series of NDFs are stored in a
*     single HDS container file whose name is still given by parameter
*     OUT.  Each group NDF has component name FITS_Gn, where n is the
*     group number.
*      Each group NDF contains the full header in the FITS extension,
*     appended by the set of group parameters.  The group parameters
*     are evaluated using their scales and offsets, and made to look
*     like FITS cards.  The keywords of these FITS cards are derived
*     from the values of PTYPEm in the main header, where m is the
*     number of the group parameter.
*     -  If FILNAM specifies a particular FITS sub-file, that sub-file
*     will be treated as if it  were the primary HDU.  No other sub-
*     files will be propagated, regardless of the value of PROEXTS.

*  Special Formats:
*     o  NDF2FITS
*
*        -  This is recognised by the presence of an HDUCLAS1 keyword
*        set to 'NDF'.  The conversion is similar to the general case,
*        except the processing of FITS sub-files and HISTORY headers.
*
*        -  An IMAGE sub-file converts to an NDF variance-array
*        component, provided the HDUCLAS2 keyword is present and has a
*        value that is either 'VARIANCE' or 'ERROR'.
*
*        -  An IMAGE sub-file converts to an NDF quality-array
*        component, provided the HDUCLAS2 keyword is present and has
*        value 'QUALITY'.
*
*        -  FITS ASCII and binary tables become NDF extensions,
*        however, the original structure path and data type are
*        restored using the values of the EXTNAME and EXTTYPE keywords
*        respectively.  An extension may be an array of structures, the
*        shape being stored in the EXTSHAPE keyword.  The shapes of
*        multi-dimensional arrays within the extensions are also
*        restored.
*
*        -  HISTORY cards in a special format created by NDF2FITS are
*        converted back into NDF HISTORY records.  This will only work
*        provided the HISTORY headers have not been tampered.  Such
*        headers are not transferred to the FITS airlock, when
*        PROFIT = .TRUE..
