      SUBROUTINE COF_DATEH( DATE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_DATEH

*  Purpose:
*     Converts the KAPPA-style date into a form used by NDF history.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_DATEH( DATE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This makes a few minor modifications to the date string obtained
*     from a KAPPA-style date format into a form used by NDF history
*     records.  Specifically two spaces around the month are
*     replaced by hyphens, and the second and third letters of the month
*     are made uppercase.

*  Arguments:
*     DATE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        On input the NDF format for a date and time, namely
*        YYYY Mmm DD HH:MM:SS.SSS.  On exit, the ISO-order format for a
*        date and time, namely YYYY-MMM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
