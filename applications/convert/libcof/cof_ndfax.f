      SUBROUTINE COF_NDFAX( FUNIT, NDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_NDFAX

*  Purpose:
*     Create an axis structure within an NDF from FITS header
*     information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_NDFAX( FUNIT, NDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches the FITS header for the keywords that
*     describe the axis structure.  At least one complete set of
*     keywords defining the axis must be present.  These keywords are
*     CRVALn, the reference value; CRPIXn, the reference pixel to which
*     the reference value corresponds; and CDELTn, the step size
*     between axis values.  If they all exist for axis n, then an axis
*     component is created and filled with the appropriate
*     values.  When only some of the axes have defined centres, the
*     remaining axes are assigned pixel co-ordinates.  If CTYPEn is in
*     the header it is used to assign a value to the nth axis's label
*     component.  If CUNITn is present, its value is stored in the nth
*     axis's units component.
*
*     The precision of the output axis-centre array depends on the
*     absolute relative size of the offset to the scale.  Single
*     precision is used if this ratio is greater than one hundred times
*     the floating-point precision.

*  Arguments:
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITSIO unit number for the FITS file.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier for the NDF to contain the axis structure.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     1996 January 25 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1996 September 16 (MJC):
*        Added support for CUNITn keyword.
*     1997 March 4 (MJC):
*        Creates a default axis structure for missing axes, and deletes
*        it if there are no valid axis centres created from the headers.
*        There are no defaults for CDELTn and CRPIXn; they must be
*        present to define the nth axis's axis centres.
*     2004 September 9 (TIMJ):
*        Use CNF_PVAL.
*     2004 September 10 (TIMJ):
*        Fix valgrind warning by initialising strings before sending
*        them to FITSIO,
*     2008 March 15 (MJC):
*        Use KAPLIBS routines instead of their cloned CON equivalents.
