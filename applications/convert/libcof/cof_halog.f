      SUBROUTINE COF_HALOG( FDL, EL, HEADER, FILE, CHDU, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_HALOG

*  Purpose:
*     Writes the FITS headers stored in an array to a logfile.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_HALOG( FDL, EL, HEADER, FILE, CHDU, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This writes the FITS headers stored in a character array
*     to a previously opened text file.  The logfile is not closed by
*     this routine.

*  Arguments:
*     FDL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The file descriptor for the logfile.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of headers to write.
*     HEADER( EL ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The array of FITS headers.
*     FILE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the FITS file or tape device to appear in the
*        heading of the log.
*     CHDU = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the current header and data unit of the FITS
*        file, which will appear in the heading of the log.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The log file must already be opened.
