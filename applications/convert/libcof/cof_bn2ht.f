      SUBROUTINE COF_BN2HT( TFORM, TYPE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_BN2HT

*  Purpose:
*     Converts FITS binary-table TFORM into an HDS primitive data type.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_BN2HT( TFORM, TYPE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This converts a TFORM string from a FITS binary-table header,
*     into its equivalent HDS primitive data type.

*  Arguments:
*     TFORM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The TFORM code from a FITS binary-table header.  The GSFC
*        extension for characters is supported.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZTYP ) (Returned)
*        The HDS primitive data type corresponding to the TFORM.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The supported TFORM type codes and their equivalent HDS types are:
*     B, _UBYTE; I, _WORD; J, _INTEGER; E or F, _REAL; D, _DOUBLE; and
*     A[n], _CHAR[*n].
