*+
*  Name:
*     COF_SMFIM

*  Purpose:
*     Imports a SMURF MEF FITS file into an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_SMFIM( FUNIT, FILE, NDF, PROFIT, LOGHDR, FDL, FMTCNV,
*                     NENCOD, ENCODS, WCSATT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This converts a SMURF multi-extension  FITS file created by
*     NDF2FITS into an NDF.  It creates the SMURF extension and
*     its constituent NDFs.  In addition the variance, axes, and
*     HISTORY and PROVENANCE records are converted for the primary NDF.
*     However, for the SMURF-extension NDFs do not have the
*     HISTORY, PROVENANCE and axes created.  It can also cope with
*     non-standard extensions using the same rules as COF_F2NDF.

*  Arguments:
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Logical-unit number of the FITS file.
*     FILE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the FITS file or device being converted.  This is
*        only used for error messages.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier of the output NDF.
*     PROFIT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., the FITS headers are written to the NDF's FITS
*        extension.  It should be set to .TRUE. in normal circumstances.
*     LOGHDR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., a record of the FITS headers is written to a log
*        file given by descriptor FDL.  If .FALSE., no log is made and
*        argument FDL is ignored.
*     FDL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The file descriptor for the log file.  This is ignored when
*        LOGHDR is .FALSE..
*     FMTCNV = LOGICAL (Given)
*        This specifies whether or not format conversion will occur.
*        The conversion applies the values of the FITS `keywords'
*        BSCALE and BZERO  to the FITS data to generate the "true" data
*        values.  Keywords is in quotes because the scale and offset
*        are actually in columns of the binary table called BSCALE and
*        BZERO.
*
*        If FMTCNV=.FALSE., the HDS type of the data array in the NDF
*        will be the equivalent of the FITS data format (e.g.
*        BITPIX = 16 creates a _WORD array).  If FMTCNV=.TRUE., the
*        data array in the NDF will be converted from the FITS data
*        type on tape to _REAL or _DOUBLE in the NDF.  The selection
*        of the floating-point type is equivalent to the data types
*        of the BSCALE and BZERO values in the header.
*
*        FMTCNV = .FALSE. is recommended, as there should be no
*        conversion to do.
*     NENCOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of encodings supplied in ENCODS.
*     ENCODS( NENCOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The preferred AST encodings to use when creating the NDF WCS
*        component, in order of preference (most preferable first).
*        It is ignored if NENCOD is zero.
*     WCSATT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Attribute settings for the WCS FitsChan.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     Details of the conversion are:
*        -  The primary data array becomes the NDF's data array.  Any
*        NaN values present become bad values in the NDF.
*        -  The keywords CRVALn, CDELTn, CRPIXn, CTYPEn, CUNITn are
*        used to create the NDF axis structure.
*        -  The OBJECT, LABEL, BUNITS keywords define the NDF's title,
*        label, and units components respectively, if they are defined.
*        -  HISTORY cards in a special format created by NDF2FITS are
*        converted back into NDF HISTORY records.
*        -  The NDF variance is derived from the data array of an
*        IMAGE extension (usually the first), if present, provided the
*        IMAGE extension headers have an HDUCLAS2 keyword whose value
*        is either 'VARIANCE' or 'ERROR'.
*        -  Other IMAGE and BINTABLE extensions are propagated to the
*        NDF extension.  It uses the extension name and type found in
*        the EXTNAME and EXTTYPE keywords, or names it FITS_EXT_n for
*        the nth FITS extension.
*        -  A FITS airlock in the NDF may be written (PROFIT=.TRUE.)
*        to store the primary data unit's headers.  The airlock
*        will not contain any NDF-style HISTORY headers.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The FITS file should already have been opened by FITSIO, and
*     is in the primary HDU.  The NDF must also exist.
*     -  The HISTORY propagation assumes that the FITS HISTORY cards
*     created by routine COF_WHISR have not been tampered.
