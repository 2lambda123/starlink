*  Name:
*     COF_WHEAD

*  Purpose:
*     Writes the FITS header derived from an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_WHEAD( NDFI, NDFFAI, COMP, FUNIT, BITPIX, PROPEX,
*                     ORIGIN, ENCOD, NATIVE, MULTI, EXTNAM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates the header section of the primary array or
*     IMAGE extension of an output FITS file based upon information in
*     an NDF.  The IMAGE extension is written when the current header
*     and data unit (CHDU) is not the first.

*     There are three stages:
*     a) Inquire of the NDF its shape, type, character components,
*     and axis components; and write these to the header.
*     b) Look for a FITS extension if requested to do so.  If one is
*     present append the headers contained therein to the FITS header
*     section, but not replacing any of the headers created in stage a).
*     c) Creates keywords describing the NDF's WCS component.  These
*     overwrite any keywords created in stages a) and b).

*  Arguments:
*     NDFI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF.  Ths is used to access those
*        characteristics such as shape and the character components that
*        are stored outside of the FITS airlock.
*     NDFFAI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of another NDF whose FITS airlock is used.  In
*        normal circumstances this will be the same identifier as
*        argument NDFI.  However, when processing an extension NDF,
*        this argument may point to the primary NDF.
*     COMP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The array component to write to the HDU.
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The logical unit number of the output FITS file.
*     BITPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The BITPIX value for the output FITS file.
*     PROPEX = LOGICAL (Given)
*        The NDF FITS extension, if present, is folded into the output
*        FITS header when PROPEX is .TRUE..  When PROPEX is .FALSE.,
*        the FITS extension is ignored.
*     ORIGIN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The value of the ORIGIN card.
*     ENCOD = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The encoding to use. If this is blank, then a default encoding
*        is chosen based on the contents of the FITS extension.  The
*        supplied string should be a recognised AST encoding such as
*        'DSS', 'FITS-WCS', 'NATIVE', etc (or a blank string).
*     NATIVE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Include a NATIVE encoding of the WCS info in the header?
*     MULTI = LOGICAL (Given)
*        This should only be set .TRUE. when input NDF is part of a
*        multi-NDF container file,
*     EXTNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        If the input NDF is part of an extension, set this to the
*        extension's path (including its name) within the NDF
*        hierarchy.  A blank string indicates that the NDF being
*        processed in the primary NDF.  This argument affects the
*        values or presence of FITS keywords.  See the Notes
*        for EXTNAME, EXTLEVEL, and EXTTYPE keywords.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     Here are details of the processing of standard items from the
*     NDF into the FITS header:
*        SIMPLE, EXTEND, PCOUNT, GCOUNT --- all take their default
*          values.
*        BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXISn --- are derived directly from the NDF
*          data array;
*        LBOUNDn --- the pixel lower bounds of an NDF whose origin is
*          not 1 along each axis.  (These are not part of the standard.)
*        CRVALn, CDELTn, CRPIXn, CTYPEn, CUNITn --- are derived from
*          the NDF axis structures if possible.  If no linear NDF axis
*          structures are present, the values in the NDF FITS extension
*          are copied.  If any are non-linear, all FITS axis
*          information is lost.  When any non-zero CROTAn card is
*          present in the FITS extension, the extension axis
*          information is propagated, and not that of the NDF axis
*          structure.  [This rule is to enable rotated axis (not
*          supported in the NDF) to be retained in the cycle from FITS
*          to NDF and back to FITS.]
*        OBJECT, LABEL, BUNIT --- the values held in NDF TITLE, LABEL,
*          and UNITS respectively are used if present, otherwise any
*          units found in the FITS extension are used.  For a variance
*          array, BUNIT is assigned to "(<unit>)**2", where
*          <unit> is the unit; for a quality array, the BUNIT header
*          is absent.
*        DATE --- is created automatically.
*        ORIGIN --- inherits any existing ORIGIN card in the NDF FITS
*          extension, unless you supply a value through argument
*          ORIGIN other than the default "Starlink Project, U.K." or
*          a blank string.
*        EXTNAME --- is the component name of the object from the COMP
*          argument, unless argument EXTNAM is not blank when keyword
*          EXTNAME is set to EXTNAM.  If the component is too long to
*          fit within the header (68 characters), EXTNAME is set to
*          '@EXTNAMEF'.  The full path is then stored in keyword
*          EXTNAMEF using the HEASARC Long-string CONTINUE convention
*          (http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/continue_keyword.html).
*        EXTVER --- is only set when EXTNAME (q.v.) cannot accommodate
*          the component name and is assigned the HDU index to provide a
*          unique identifier.
*        EXTLEVEL --- when argument EXTNAM is not blank, this is the
*          level in the hierarchical structure of the extension.  A
*          top-level extension has value 1, sub-components of this
*          extension have value 2 and so on.
*        EXTTYPE --- when argument EXTNAM is not blank, this is set to
*          "NDF".
*        HDUCLAS1, HDUCLASn --- "NDF" and the value of COMP
*          respectively.
*        XTENSION, BSCALE, BZERO, BLANK and END --- are not propagated
*          from the extension.  The first will be set for any
*          extension.  BSCALE and BZERO will be defined based on the
*          chosen output data type in comparison with the NDF array's
*          type, but cards with values 1.0 and 0.0 respectively are
*          written to reserve places in the header section.  Likewise a
*          dummy BLANK card is written for the integer types.  The
*          BLANK value may be written as required, dependent on the
*          data type and any scaling.  These `reservation' cards are
*          for efficiency and they can always be deleted later.  The
*          END card is written by FITSIO automatically once the header
*          is closed.
*        HDSNAME is the NDF name for a component NDF in a multi-NDF
*          container file, for example I2.
*        HDSTYPE is set to "NDF" for a component NDF in a multi-NDF
*          container file.
*        DATASUM and CHECKSUM --- are removed to avoid spurious values
*          being stored.
*        PRVn, OBSn, and FILEID --- CADC provenance headers are removed.
*        PRVPn, PRVIn, PRVDn, PRVCn, PRVMn ---  provenance headers are
*          removed.

*  History:
*     1994 May 31 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1995 November 16 (MJC):
*        Fixed a bug that could occur in some circumstances when the
*        a rare CROTAn card is present.
*     1996 February 8 (MJC):
*        Added checks not to propagate the FITSIO banner and Starlink
*        ORIGIN card in the NDF's FITS extension to the output FITS
*        file.
*     1996 September 16 (MJC):
*        Corrected usage of CTYPEn (was CRTYPEn) and introduced CUNITn
*        for axis units.
*     1997 November 14 (MJC):
*        Filtered LBOUNDn keywords.
*     18-DEC-1997 (DSB):
*        Propagation of NDF's WCS component added. The old code which
*        generated keywords CRVALn, CRPIXn etc, has been retained for
*        compatibility with old NDFs. Values generated from the WCS
*        component over-write any created by the old code.
*     1998 January 5 (MJC):
*        Added ORIGIN argument.  Inherits airlock ORIGIN card if
*        present unless ORIGIN argument is neither the default nor
*        blank.
*     1998 February 4 (MJC):
*        Now issues a warning meesage if an invalid header is located.
*        Substitutes space for null in headers.
*     9-NOV-1998 (DSB):
*        Replaced arguments NENCOD and ENCODS by NATIVE.
*     22-JUN-1999 (DSB):
*        Added ENCOD argument.
*     11-APR-2000 (DSB):
*        Updated description of ENCOD argument.
*     23-OCT-2000 (AJC):
*        Ignore all after END (could be garbage)
*     30-NOV-2000 (AJC):
*        Correctly omit airlock ORIGIN card from output if ORIGIN
*        argument is not default or blank.
*     2006 April 5 (MJC):
*        Allow for COMP='HEADER'.
*     2006 October 24 (MJC):
*        Added MULTI argument.  Moved code for HDSNAME and HDSTYPE from
*        COF_NDF2F and filtered any existing keywords with those names
*        in the FITS airlock.
*     2007 October 19 (MJC):
*        Revise documented BUNIT for VARIANCE and QUALITY.
*     2007 October 25 (MJC):
*        Add EXTNAM argument.
*     2007 October 26 (MJC):
*        Add NDFFAI argument.
*     2008 March 12 (MJC):
*        Remove CHECKSUM and DATASUM keywords, and CADC provenance
*        keywords.
*     2008 April 28 (MJC):
*        Do not exclude provenance keywords if the NDF does not have a
*        PROVENANCE extension.  Allow for latest FITS citation COMMENT
*        cards.
*     2008 May 20 (MJC):
*        Exclude CADC new FILEID provenance header.
*     10-JUN-2008 (DSB):
*        Do not propagate ASTWARN cards from FITS extension to output
*        header.
*     12-JUN-2008 (TIMJ):
*        Fix valgrind warning.
*     25-JUN-2009 (TIMJ):
*        Use HDS_SPLIT to find whether we have an NDF inside an HDS container.
*        This is more reliable than looking for a "." in the filename (since
*        sometimes directories have "."s in them).
*     2009 November 25 (MJC):
*        Allow for long extension names.
