*  Name:
*     COF_LWS1

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the distinct wavelength values in array and orders them.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_LWS1( NOBS, PREC, OWAVEL, OERROR, NWAVEL, WAVEL, ERROR,
*                    IP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates arrays sorted in ascending order of the
*     distinct wavelengths and the corresponding errors, for a set of
*     observations from an LWS AN data product.  The measure of
*     distinctiveness is given by a maximum-allowed difference.

*  Arguments:
*     NOBS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of observations.
*     PREC = REAL (Given)
*        The maximum-allowed difference in wavelength for two values to
*        be regarded as identical.  Non-positive values are treated as
*        the machine precision.
*     OWAVEL( NOBS ) = REAL (Given)
*        The wavelengths for each of the observations.
*     OERROR( NOBS ) = REAL (Given)
*        The uncertainty in the wavelength for each of the observations.
*     NWAVEL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of distinct wavelengths found in the OWAVEL array.
*     WAVEL( NOBS ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The sorted distinct list wavelengths.
*     ERROR( NOBS ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The list of wavelength errors corresponding to the each of the
*        elements of WAVEL .
*     IP( NOBS ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The indices to the sorted wavelengths and errors.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Sort the array of observed wavelengths into ascending order.  There
*  are likely to be more-efficient strategies, but unless that is
*  significant problem, we'll use this approach for simplicity.  Use
*  the index array to make the interchanges to the observed wavelength
*  errors as well as the wavelengths themselves.

*  Loop through each observation.
*  ==============================

*  By definition the first distinct wavelength and error are known.

*  Initialise the the counter of distinct wavelengths.
         NWAVEL = 1

*  The job is done if there is only one wavelength.  (As far as we know
*  this cannot happen, so this is just some defensive programming.)
         IF ( NOBS .GT. 1 ) THEN

*  Loop through the array of sorted wavelengths.

*  It does, so increment the counter and assign the wavelength and its
*  assoicated error to the arrays of distinct values.
