      LOGICAL FUNCTION COF_ISWCS( INDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_ISWCS

*  Purpose:
*     See if the FITS extension of an NDF contains WCS information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = COF_ISWCS( INDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine attempts to read a FrameSet from the FITS extension of
*     the supplied NDF. If succesfull, and if the FrameSet has more than
*     one Frame (the pixel grid), then .TRUE. is returned. NATIVE
*     encodings in the FITS extension are ignored.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier for the NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     .TRUE. if the FITS extension of the NDF has usable WCS information.
