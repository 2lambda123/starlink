      SUBROUTINE COF_DOSCL( FUNITH, FUNITD, FMTCNV, TYPE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_DOSCL

*  Purpose:
*     Sets scaling requirements for FITS2NDF

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_DOSCL( FUNITH, FUNITD, FMTCNV, TYPE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine sets the scale and offset of a FITS data array
*     for FITSIO, and obtains the data type of the scaled
*     floating-point array.

*  Arguments:
*     FUNITH = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITS unit number associated with the header.  This may
*        differ from that associated with the data if a merged header
*        has been constructed.
*     FUNITD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITS unit number associated with the data.
*     FMTCNV = LOGICAL (Given)
*        This specifies whether or not format conversion will occur.
*        The conversion applies the values of the FITS keywords BSCALE
*        and BZERO to the FITS data to generate the "true" data values.
*        This applies to IMAGE extensions, as well as the primary data
*        array.  If BSCALE and BZERO are not given in the FITS header,
*        they are taken to be 1.0 and 0.0 respectively.
*
*        If FMTCNV=.FALSE., the HDS type of the data array in the NDF
*        will be the equivalent of the FITS data format on tape (e.g.
*        BITPIX = 16 creates a _WORD array).  If FMTCNV=.TRUE., the
*        data array in the NDF will be converted from the FITS data
*        type on tape to _REAL or _DOUBLE in the NDF.  The choice of
*        floating-point data type depends on the number of significant
*        digits in the BSCALE and BZERO keywords.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( NDF__SZTYP ) (Given and returned)
*        Given as the type of the NDF component.  It is returned as the
*        effective data type for the data array based upon keywords
*        BSCALE and BZERO.  It is either '_REAL' or '_DOUBLE' if the
*        scale and offset do not take their defaults of one and zero
*        respectively, and TYPE is returned blank otherwise.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  The FMTCNV flag decides whether or not the data scaling is required.

*  keywords.
      IF ( FMTCNV ) THEN

*  Scaling is to be applied.  Find the data type required for the
*  output array based upon the number of significant digits in the
*  BSCALE and BZERO keywords.  If these have values of 1.0D0 and 0.0D0
*  respectively either explicitly, or because one or both are absent,
*  then the data type can be set to the null string.  This instructs
*  later routines like COF_STYPC to use the data type specified by the
*  FITSIO data-type code (based on BITPIX).
         CALL COF_DSTYP( FUNITH, 'BSCALE', 'BZERO', TYPE, STATUS )

*  If the header and data FUNITs are different, set the scaling factors
*  explicitly for the data unit according to the header unit just in case
*  it inherited them from the primary.

*  To prevent scaling, the scale and offset must be set to one and zero
