      SUBROUTINE COF_FTWCS( FUNIT, INDF, NENCOD, ENCODS, FILE, WCSATT, 
     :                      STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_FTWCS

*  Purpose:
*     Uses coordinate system information in the FITS headers of the current 
*     header and data unit to create WCS and AXIS components in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_FTWCS( FUNIT, INDF, NENCOD, ENCODS, FILE, WCSATT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This constructs an AST FrameSet from the FITS headers of the current 
*     header and data unit and adds it into the existing WCS information in
*     the supplied NDF. It can also create AXIS structures (see below).
*
*     The information needed to create the FrameSet can be stored several
*     times in a single FITS header, using different keywords each time.
*     Each of these descriptions is known as an "encoding" and AST supports 
*     several different encoding schemes (i.e. FITS-WCS, DSS, NATIVE).
*     If the supplied FITS header contains more than one encoding then we
*     need to choose which one to use. This decision is important because
*     is is possible for encodings to be inconsistent (i.e. software may
*     modify one encoding without making equivalent modifications to the
*     other encodings). The simplest way to make this decision is to hand
*     responsibility for it over to the user. In this case, the user
*     supplies a list of preferred encodings, and the first of these encodings
*     which exists in the FITS header gets used. If the user does not
*     know which encoding to use, then we can make an intelligent guess by
*     comparing the encodings to see which ones are consistent and which
*     ones are not. 
*
*     In addition to the WCS component, this routine also creates AXIS 
*     Centre, Label and Units components in the NDF, but only if they do 
*     not already exist, and if the FrameSet read from the FITS header 
*     contains an AXIS Frame. NDF2FITS does not write out the AXIS Frame 
*     if it is equivalent to pixel coordinates, and so no AXIS structures 
*     will be created by this routine in this case. Also, if the AXIS Frame 
*     represents linear axis coordinates, then there will already be AXIS 
*     structures in the NDF (created earlier within FITS2NDF), and so again 
*     no AXIS  structures will be created by this routine. Thus, this routine 
*     will only create AXIS structures in the cases where the axis coordinates 
*     are non-linear.

*  Arguments:
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITSIO unit number for the FITS file.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     NENCOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of encodings supplied in ENCODS.
*     ENCODS( NENCOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The user's preferred AST encodings. If NENCOD is zero, then this
*        is ignored, and an intelligent guess is made as to which encoding
*        to use (see COF_WCSIM).
*     FILE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the FITS file or tape device to appear in error
*        messages.
*     WCSATT = CARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Extra attribute settings for the WCS FitsChan.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The FITS file must already be opened with the FITSIO library.
