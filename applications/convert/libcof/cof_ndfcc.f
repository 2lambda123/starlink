      SUBROUTINE COF_NDFCC( FUNIT, NDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COF_NDFCC

*  Purpose:
*     Sets the character components of an NDF using a FITS header.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COF_NDFCC( FUNIT, NDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine sets the title, and units character components
*     of an NDF, by using the information stored in a FITS header.
*     Specifically, the OBJECT keyword's value, if present, becomes the
*     NDF title.  Similarly the value of the BUNIT keyword is mapped to
*     the NDF units. 

*  Arguments:
*     FUNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITSIO unit number for the FITS file.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF which is to have character components
*        assigned.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The curreent header and data unit must either be primary or an
*     IMAGE extension.  The routine aborts with an error status if this
*     requirement is not satisfied.
