      SUBROUTINE BDF2NDF( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     BDF2NDF

*  Purpose:
*     Converts a Starlink Interim BDF file to an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL BDF2NDF( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application converts data files from the Bulk Data Frame
*     (BDF) format used by the INTERIM Environment (see SUN/4) to the
*     Starlink standard NDF format (see SUN/33 or SGP/38).  Type
*     conversion may be performed at the same time.

*  Usage:
*     BDF2NDF IN OUT [TYPE] [DESCRIP]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IN = BDF (Read)
*        The BDF to be converted to an NDF.  A file extension must not
*        be given since ".BDF" is assumed.
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The name of NDF converted from the BDF.  It becomes the new
*        current NDF.
*     TYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The data type of the output NDF.  It must be one of the
*        following HDS types: "_BYTE", "_WORD", "_REAL", "_INTEGER",
*        "_DOUBLE", "_UBYTE", "_UWORD" corresponding to signed byte,
*        signed word, real, integer, double precision, unsigned byte,
*        and unsigned word.  See SUN/92 for further details.  An
*        unambiguous abbreviation may be given. ["_REAL"]
*     DESCRIP = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If true the descriptors in the BDF are reported as they are
*        copied to the FITS extension within the output NDF. [FALSE]
*     CONNECT = FILENAME (Write)
*        The Interim connection file.  It is deleted when the
*        application terminates.  [NDF2BDF.TMP]
*     COMMAND = FILENAME (Write)
*        The Interim command file.  It is deleted when the application
*        terminates.  [USERCOM.TMP]

*  Examples:
*     BDF2NDF OLD NEW
*        This converts the BDF called OLD (in file OLD.BDF) to the NDF
*        called NEW (in file NEW.SDF).  NEW's data array will have
*        the _REAL data type.  Descriptors are copied to the FITS
*        extension but are not reported.
*     BDF2NDF OLD NEW DESCRIP
*        This converts the BDF called OLD (in file OLD.BDF) to the NDF
*        called NEW (in file NEW.SDF).  NEW's data array will have
*        the _REAL data type.  Descriptors are copied to the FITS
*        extension and are reported.
*     BDF2NDF HORSE HORSE TYPE="_WORD"
*        This converts the BDF called HORSE (in file HORSE.BDF) to the
*        NDF also called HORSE (in file HORSE.SDF).  The NDF's data
*        array will contain signed 2-byte integers.  Descriptors are
*        copied to the FITS extension but are not reported.

*  Notes:
*     -  The conversion rules can be summarised as follow:
*        o  the BDF data array is copied to the NDF main data array;
*        by default the output data array has the data type _REAL.
*        o  The BLANK descriptor is not used to flag pixels in the NDF
*        with the bad value.  Use KAPPA's SETMAGIC to flag another
*        value.
*        o  The BDF descriptors are written to the NDF FITS extension.
*        Long values may be truncated, 65 for characters and 20 for
*        numbers.  The formating adheres to the FITS standard.
*        Descriptors already in the FITS format are copied as is, so
*        La Palma ING-format headers can be propagated.
*        o  If the BDF descriptors contain the FITS keywords CRVALn, 
*        CDELTn, the appropriate axis structures are generated in 
*        the output NDF. In addition should CRTYPEn also be present
*        the labels are added to these structures.
*        o  If the BDF descriptors contain the FITS keywords TITLE or
*        LABEL or BUNITS, the associated character string value is
*        written to the NDF TITLE, LABEL or UNITS component as
*        appropriate.
*        o  HISTORY descriptors are not used to make an HISTORY
*        component in the NDF.
*     -  WARNING: the BDF size may grow when TYPE is specified due to
*     an incarnation being created.  See below and SUN/4 for more
*     details.

*  Incarnations:
*     A BDF contains one or more `incarnations' of the data array.  An
*     incarnation of a data array is simply a copy of that data array
*     stored with a particular data type.  For example, a BDF may
*     contain incarnations of the same data array stored as a REAL
*     array, and an INTEGER array.  This rather strange behaviour is a
*     consequence of the way the INTERIM environment deals with data
*     access.  For example, if a application attempts to map a BDF data
*     array of INTEGER type as a REAL array, type conversion must take
*     place.  Instead of doing this in virtual memory, a second
*     incarnation of the data, this time of type REAL is created and
*     stored in the original file (causing perhaps a doubling of the
*     file size).  This second incarnation of the data array is stored
*     to avoid performing the same type conversion in the future.  (It
*     is perhaps significant that no such scheme has been employed with
*     subsequent data systems.)  One consequence of this behaviour is
*     that a BDF data array may not have a unique type.  BDF2NDF will
*     use the first type it finds as the default.  Specify the
*     TYPE parameter explicitly to ensure that the correct data type is
*     created within the NDF.
*
*     To prevent the BDF growing, just remove write access from the
*     file.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Activate FIO.
*     -  Get the name of the input BDF. Get and validate the HDS
*     type. Convert it to an Interim format code for the input BDF.
*     -  Create a old-style Starlink 'connection file' for an
*     application BDF2NDF. Create a RUNSTAR-type command line in another
*     file. Assign the logical names PROGCON and USERCOM to these files.
*     This will fool the old-style Starlink Interface Routines into
*     working correctly.  Map in VM the data array using the old-style
*     routine RDIMAG.
*     -  Create the output NDF with a primitive NDF and map the main
*     data array with write access.
*     -  Copy the BDF's data array to the NDF.
*     -  Create TITLE, LABEL, and UNITS components in the NDF when the
*     relevant descriptors are present in the BDF.
*     -  Create AXIS structures in the NDF when the FITS axis keywords
*     are present in the BDF.
*     -  Copy any other descriptors from the BDF to the NDF FITS
*     extension.
*     -  Unmap arrays, close down the NDF system and deactivate FIO.
*     -  Reset INTERIM environment in case BDF2NDF is re-run without re-
*     loading.

*  Related Applications:
*     CONVERT: NDF2BDF.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  Note the data array in the NDF is of the primitive form.
*     -  Only available on VMS platforms.

*  History:
*     1989 August 16th (JM):
*        Adapted from STARIN. This version outputs an NDF rather than
*        an IMAGE file. The BDF descriptors are copied to .MORE.FITS.
*     1991 February 5th (JM):
*        Program changed to use NDF_ routines.  If BDF descriptors
*        contain sufficient information, i.e. values for CRVALn,
*        CDELTn, the appropriate axis structures are generated in the
*        output NDF.  If the BDF descriptors contain values for the
*        data files TITLE and LABEL, these are copied to the NDF TITLE
*        and LABEL object respectively.
*     1992 January 30 (MJC):
*        Changed FORMAT parameter to TYPE for consistency with the
*        paper documentation (SUN/55).  Also gave TYPE a dynamic
*        default of the type of the BDF.  Added the ADAM parameters
*        section to the prologue.  Renamed the parameters for the NDF
*        and BDF to IN and OUT respectively to agree with SUN/55 and
*        consistency.  Added examples.  Tidied the prologue.  Processes
*        UNITS and AXIS.LABEL components of the NDF.  Corrected the
*        evaluation of the axis centres to allow for a pixel offset
*        (as defined in the FITS standard) in the descriptors.  Ensured
*        that an NDF axis structure will be valid by making a complete
*        set of axis-centre arrays.
*     1992 July 17 (MJC):
*        Removed loop when obtaining the type as PAR routine validates
*        the data types.
*     1993 January 27 (MJC):
*        Corrected the description of the default value of parameter
*        TYPE, and hence modified the examples.
*     2004 September 9 (TIMJ):
*        Use CNF_PVAL
*     {enter_further_changes_here}

*  Bugs:
*     -  May give spurious error messages if running under ICL.  This
*     happens if a non-existent BDF is given as the input file.  A
*     subsequent invocation of the application may result in a repeat of
*     the error message although the conversion is carried out
*     correctly.
