#  Name:
#     gif2ndf
 
#  Purpose:
#     Converts a GIF-format file into an NDF 
 
#  Type of Module:
#     Bourne shell script
  
#  Description:
#     This Bourne-shell script converts a Graphics Interchange Format
#     (GIF) file into an unsigned-byte (256 grey-level) NDF format file.
#     It handles one- or two-dimensional images.  The script uses
#     various PBMPLUS utilities to produce a FITS file, flipped top
#     to bottom, and then FITS2NDF to produce the final NDF.  Error
#     messages are converted into Starlink style (preceded by !).

#  Usage:
#     gif2ndf in [out]

#  Parameters:
#     IN = FILENAME (Read)
#        The name of the GIF file to be converted (without the .gif extension
#        which is assumed).
#     OUT = NDF (Write)
#        The name of the NDF to be generated (without the .sdf extension).
#        If the OUT parameter is omitted, the value of the IN parameter
#        is used.
 
#  Examples:
#     gif2ndf old new
#        This converts the GIF file old.gif into an NDF called new
#        (in file new.sdf).
#     gif2ndf horse
#        This converts the GIF file horse.gif into an NDF called horse
#        (in file horse.sdf).

#     CONVERT: NDF2GIF

#  Notes:
#     This initial version of the script generates images with at most
#     256 grey levels.  It does not use the image colour lookup table.
#
#     Input image filenames must have the extension .gif.
#
#     The PBMPLUS utilities giftopnm, ppmtopgm and pgmtofits 
#     must be available on your PATH.
