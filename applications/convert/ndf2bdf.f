      SUBROUTINE NDF2BDF( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDF2BDF

*  Purpose:
*     Converts an NDF to a Starlink Interim BDF file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDF2BDF( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application converts an NDF (see SUN/33) to the Bulk Data
*     Frame (BDF) format used by the INTERIM Environment (see SUN/4).
*     Type conversion may be performed at the same time.

*  Usage:
*     NDF2BDF IN OUT [TYPE] [DESCRIP]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF to be converted to a BDF.  The suggested default is
*        the current NDF if one exists, otherwise it is the current
*        value.
*     OUT = BDF (Write)
*        The name of BDF converted from the NDF.  No file extension
*        should be given, as the application will automatically give
*        extension ".BDF".
*     TYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The data type of the output BDF.  It must be one of the
*        following Interim types: "SB", "SW", "R", "SL", "DP", "UB",
*        "UW" corresponding to signed byte, signed word, real, signed
*        longword, double precision, unsigned byte, unsigned word.
*        See SUN/4 for further details.  The default is the type
*        corresponding to that of the NDF.  []
*     DESCRIP = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If true the keyword and values in a FITS extension are copied
*        to the BDF's descriptors with a number of exceptions listed
*        in the Notes.  [FALSE]
*     CONNECT = FILENAME (Write)
*        The Interim connection file.  It is deleted when the
*        application terminates.  [NDF2BDF.TMP]
*     COMMAND = FILENAME (Write)
*        The Interim command file.  It is deleted when the application
*        terminates.  [USERCOM.TMP]

*  Examples:
*     NDF2BDF NEW OLD
*        This converts the NDF called NEW (in file NEW.SDF) to the
*        BDF called OLD (in file OLD.BDF).  OLD's data array will have
*        the same data type as that of NEW.  The FITS header within
*        NEW is converted to descriptors within OLD.
*     NDF2BDF NEW OLD DESCRIP
*        This converts the NDF called NEW (in file NEW.SDF) to the
*        BDF called OLD (in file OLD.BDF).  OLD's data array will have
*        the same data type as that of NEW.  The FITS header within
*        NEW is converted to descriptors within OLD, and are reported
*        to the user.
*     NDF2BDF HORSE HORSE TYPE=R
*        This converts the NDF called HORSE (in file HORSE.SDF) to the
*        BDF also called HORSE (in file HORSE.BDF).  The BDF's data
*        array will contain 4-byte floating-point numbers.  The FITS
*        header within HORSE is converted to descriptors within
*        HORSE.BDF.

*  Notes:
*     The details of the conversion are as follows:
*        -  the NDF main data array is written to the BDF data array.
*        -  QUALITY, and VARIANCE have no counterparts in the BDF, and
*        so cannot be propagated.
*        -  HISTORY is not propagated.
*        -  UNITS is written to descriptor BUNITS.
*        -  The number of dimensions of the data array is written
*        to the BDF descriptor NAXIS, and the actual dimensions to
*        NAXIS1, NAXIS2 etc. as appropriate.
*        -  If the NDF contains any linear axis structures the
*        information necessary to generate these structures is written
*        to the BDF descriptors (except when there is a non-zero value
*        of CROTAn in the FITS extension).  For example, if a linear
*        AXIS(1) structure exists in the input NDF the value of the
*        first data point is stored in the BDF descriptor CRVAL1,
*        and the incremental value between successive axis data is
*        stored in CDELT1. If there is an axis label it is written to
*        descriptor CRTYPE1, and axis unit is written to CTYPE1.
*        (Similarly for AXIS(2) structures etc.) FITS does not have a
*        standard method of storing axis widths and variances, so these
*        NDF components will not be propagated.  Non-linear axis data
*        arrays cannot be represented by CRVALn and CDELTn, and must be
*        ignored.
*        -  If the input NDF contains TITLE and LABEL components these
*        are stored in the BDF descriptors TITLE and LABEL.
*        -  If the input NDF contains a FITS extension, the FITS items
*        may be written to the BDF descriptors, with the following
*        exceptions:
*           o  NAXIS, and NAXISn are derived from the dimensions of
*           the NDF data array as described above, so these items
*           are not copied from the NDF FITS extension.
*           o  The TITLE, LABEL, and BUNITS descriptors are only copied
*           if no TITLE, LABEL, and UNITS NDF components have already
*           been copied into these descriptors.
*           o  The CDELTn, CRVALn, CRPIXn, CTYPEn, and CRTYPEn
*           descriptors in the FITS extension are only copied if the
*           input NDF contained no linear axis structures or there is a
*           non-zero CROTAn descriptor.
*           o  The standard order of the FITS keywords is preserved,
*           thus NAXIS and NAXISn appear immediately after the second
*           card image, which should be BITPIX.  No FITS comments are
*           written following the values of the above exceptions for
*           compatibility with certain INTERIM applications.
*           FITS-header lines with blank keywords are not copied.
*        -  Other extensions have no BDF counterparts and therefore are
*        not propagated.
*        -  All character objects longer than 70 characters are
*        truncated in a BDF descriptor.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Get and validate the Interim format code for the output BDF.
*     -  Create a old-style Starlink 'connection file' for a program
*     NDF2BDF.
*     -  Open the input NDF and map the main data array.
*     -  Get the parameter BDFFILE and create a RUNSTAR-type command
*     line in another file. Assign the logical names PROGCON and
*     USERCOM to these files. This will fool the old-style Starlink
*     Interface Routines into working correctly.
*     -  Create and map the required data into VM using the old-style
*     routine WRDATA.
*     -  Copy the data from old-style to new-style VM.
*     -  Establish the values for the FITS-like descriptors NAXIS,
*     NAXISn, CDELTn, CRVALn, CRTYPEn, CTYPEn, BUNITS, TITLE and LABEL
*     from the NDF standard items if possible. These are copied into
*     the appropriate BDF FITS descriptors.
*     -  If the NDF contains a FITS extension, those items not already
*     set, are copied to the appropriate BDF descriptor.  Detect any
*     rotated axis.
*     -  Handle rotated axes by re-writing the axis descriptors (CRVALn,
*     CDELTn, CRPIXn) from the FITS headers.
*     -  Reset INTERIM environment in case NDF2BDF is re-run without re-
*     loading.

*  Related Applications:
*     CONVERT: BDF2NDF.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  Primitive NDFs are created.
*     -  The value of bad pixels is not written to the descriptor BLANK.
*     -  Only available on VMS platforms.

*  History:
*     1991 March 5th (JM):
*        Adapted from STAROUT.
*     1991 October 30 (MJC):
*        Changed FORMAT parameter to TYPE for consistency with the paper
*        documentation.  Also gave TYPE a dynamic default of the type of
*        the NDF.  Added the ADAM parameters and Usage sections to the
*        prologue.  Tidied the prologue.
*     1992 January 30 (MJC):
*        Renamed the parameters for the NDF and BDF to IN and OUT
*        respectively to agree with SUN/55 and consistency.  Added
*        examples.  Processes UNITS and AXIS.LABEL components of the
*        NDF.
*     1992 September 5 (MJC):
*        Prevented special keywords from being copied from the FITS
*        header when there are overriding objects present in the
*        NDF; these are formatted into FITS-like descriptors.
*     1992 November 16 (MJC):
*        Made more robust for the case when there are duplicated
*        standard FITS headers at the start of the FITS extension.
*        Allowed for non-zero axis rotation so that axis information is
*        not lost when converting a BDF to an NDF and then back to a
*        BDF.
*     1993 January 4 (MJC):
*        Fixed a bug that made it was possible not to write mandatory
*        descriptors to the BDF.  Allowed lowercase Interim types.
*     2004 September 9 (TIMJ):
*        Use CNF_PVAL.
*     2009 June 29 (MJC):
*        Replaced deprecated CON_MOVE (and CON_TYPSZ) with KPG1_COPY
*        from KAPLIBS.

*   Now the various descriptors are written to the BDF.
*   ===================================================

*   This is a really messy bit of code, all because INTERIM handling of
*   descriptors is so vague, undocumented, and badly designed...  The
*   problem is that when there are FITS descriptors, where the keywords
*   have to appear in a certain order.  There will be other descriptors
*   derived from the NDF, such as dimensions and axis centres, which
*   have to be merged.  Unfortunately, Interim descriptors appear in an
*   undefined order.  Experimentation reveals they appear in the order
*   they were written.  One solution might have been to write the
*   FITS descriptors and then replace them in situ when the value is
*   to be overridden by another NDF object.  This fails because Interim
*   just flags the overwritten descriptor as not being available and
*   writes the replaced value at the end of the descriptors.

*   First decide whether or not these are output to the user.
