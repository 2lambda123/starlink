      SUBROUTINE CON_PCARD( CARD, LINENO, EL, CARDAR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_PCARD

*  Purpose:
*     Puts a card image into an array of card images.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_PCARD( CARD, LINENO, EL, CARDAR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This copies an 80-character `card image' into an array of card
*     images at a specified element.  It is most likely use is to
*     write FITS headers.

*  Arguments:
*     CARD = CHARACTER * ( 80 ) (Given)
*        The CARD to be copied.
*     LINENO = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index that this line will have in the CARDAR array.  It
*        must have a value between 1 and EL.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of CARDAR.
*     CARDAR( EL ) = CHARACTER * ( 80 ) (Given and Returned)
*        The array of card images. On exit it will contain CARD at
*        element LINENO provided LINENO is within its bounds.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
