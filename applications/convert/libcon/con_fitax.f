      SUBROUTINE CON_FITAX( NCARD, HEADER, SCARD, NDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_FITAX

*  Purpose:
*     Creates an axis structure within an NDF from FITS header
*     information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_FITAX( NCARD, HEADER, SCARD, NDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches the FITSD header for the keywords that
*     describe the axis structure.  If at least one reference value,
*     CRVALn, exists then an axis component is created and filled with
*     the appropriate values.  CDELTn defines the step between axis
*     values.  If it is not present in the header it is set to 1.
*     CRPIXn defines the reference pixel to which the reference value
*     corresponds.  If is absent form the header pixel 1 is assumed to
*     be the reference pixel.  If CTYPEn is in the header it is used to
*     assign a value to the nth axis's label component, and CUNITn
*     is used to assign the units for the nth axis.
*
*     The precision of the output axis-centre array depends on the
*     absolute relative size of the offset to the scale.  Single
*     precision is used if this ratio is greater than one hundred times
*     the floating-point precision.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of card images in the buffer.
*     HEADER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * 80 (Given)
*        The FITS header 'cards', each element corresponding to a
*        80-character card.
*     SCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from where the search will begin.  This
*        is needed because the headers make contain a dummy header
*        prior to an extension.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier for the NDF to contain the axis structure.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     1990 November 15 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1991 February 28 (MJC):
*        Converted BUFFER from an assumed-size to an adjustable array
*        via the NCARD argument for revised FTS1_GKEYx calls.
*     1992 July 15 (MJC):
*        Selects appropriate precision of the AXIS arrays.
*     1992 September 18 (MJC):
*        Renamed from FTS1_AXIS for CONVERT.  All FTS1_ AND KPG1 calls
*        replaced by CON_ equivalents.
*     1996 September 16 (MJC):
*        Modern style commenting and declarations.  Added support for
*        CUNITn and axis units.
*     2001 August 30 (AJC):
*        Correct CON_GKEYD arguments.
*     2004 September 9 (TIMJ):
*        Use CNF_PVAL.
*     2008 March 15 (MJC):
*        Use KAPLIBS routines instead of their cloned CON equivalents.
*     2009 June 29 (MJC):
*        Replace cloned CON_GKEYx with KAPLIBS FTS1_GKEYx.
