      SUBROUTINE CON_CONS<T>( VALUE, EL, ARRAY, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_CONSx

*  Purpose:
*     Sets all elements in a vectorised array to a specified value.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_CONS<T>( VALUE, EL, ARRAY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine sets all the pixels in a 1-dimensional array to a
*     specified value.

*  Arguments:
*     VALUE = ? (Given)
*        Value to be substituted in every pixel.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimension of the array to be filled with a constant.
*     ARRAY( EL ) = ? (Returned)
*        The output array containing a single value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*        Global status value

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric and logical data type:
*     replace "x" in the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B, UB, or L as
*     appropriate.  The VALUE and ARRAY arguments must have the data
*     type specified.
