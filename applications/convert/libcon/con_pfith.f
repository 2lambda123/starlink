*+
*  Name:
*     CON_PFITH

*  Purpose:
*     Process the headers in a FITS header.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_PFITH( FD, FORM, LOC, MAXHDR, REPORT, HSTART, HDNUM,
*    :                EXTEND, NHEADS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine reads a FITS header from an ASCII or unformatted
*     file and writes the header data into an HDS file; the headers are
*     optionally reported to the user.  The dimension of the HDS buffer
*     array in the HDS structure is enlarged if the buffer is filled.

*  Arguments:
*     FD     = INTEGER (Given)
*        The descriptor of the file containing the FITS header.
*     FORM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The format of the file.  FORM = 'FORMATTED' gives an ASCII
*        formatted file; anything else results in an unformatted file.
*     LOC    = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given)
*        The locator to the HDS object that will contain the header
*        cards.
*     MAXHDR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of header sections in the current sub-file.
*     REPORT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true the header cards are reported to the user.
*     HSTART( MAXHDR ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the header card where each FITS header starts.
*     HDNUM( MAXHDR ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of header records processed and stored in the
*        output data structure, one per header section in the current
*        sub-file.
*     EXTEND = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true there are extensions in the FITS sub-file.
*     NHEADS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of header sections in the sub-file.  This includes
*        dummy FITS header sections.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.
