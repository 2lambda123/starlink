*+
*  Name:
*     CON_GHSTD

*  Purpose:
*     Calculates the histogram of an array of data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
*
*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_GHSTD( BAD, DIM, ARRAY, NUMBIN, VALMAX, VALMIN, HIST,
*     :               STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine calculates the truncated histogram of an array of
*     data between defined limits and in a defined number of bins.

*  Arguments:
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., bad pixels will be processed.  This should not be
*        set to false unless the input array contains no bad pixels.
*     DIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimension of the array whose histogram is required.
*     ARRAY( DIM ) = ? (Given)
*        The input data array.
*     NUMBIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of bins used in the histogram.  For integer data types
*        this should result in a bin width of at least one unit.  So for
*        example, byte data should never have more than 256 bins.
*     VALMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Maximum data value included in the array.
*     VALMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION  (Given)
*        Minimum data value included in the array.
*     HIST( NUMBIN ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Array containing the histogram.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     - Compute the scale factor
*     - For all array elements, check whether the value is within the
*     range of the histogram, and if it is compute its bin number. Check
*     for bad pixels if requested.

*  History:
*     1990 July 19 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1991 September 17 (MJC):
*        Fixed overflow bug.
*     1991 November 13 (MJC):
*        Fixed a bug converting NUMBIN for calculations.
*     1996 March 25 (MJC):
*        Better check that the bin width is valid.
*     1996 July 3 (MJC):
*        Made to cope with unsigned integer types.
*     05-FEB-1999 (AJC):
*        Copied and renamed from KAPPA KPG1_GHISTD.  Removed use of
*        NUM_ conversions and IF on binsize calculation (as no longer
*        generic)

*  ========================
 
*  For processing efficiency deal with the various cases separately.
*  These are with and without bad pixels, and unsigned integer types
*  versus other types.  The latter difference is needed because Fortran
*  does not support unsigned integer types, and numerical comparisons
*  will use the signed types, and hence give the wrong answers.  Thus
*  the comparisons are performed in floating-point.
 
*  Bad-pixel testing to be undertaken on Fortran data types.
