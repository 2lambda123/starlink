      SUBROUTINE CON_EKEY<T>( NDF, NAME, NOCCUR, THERE, VALUE, COMENT,
     :                        STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_EKEYx

*  Purpose:
*     Gets the value and comment of a named header of type <COMM> from
*     an NDF's FITS extension.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_EKEYx( NDF, NAME, NOCCUR, THERE, VALUE, COMENT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine searches the FITS NDF extension containing the
*     header card images from a FITS file for a keyword NAME; and
*     returns its value and comment, and the number of the card image
*     within the buffer array that contains the named keyword.  The
*     search ends when the next end of a header block, marked by the
*     END keyword, is encountered or the buffer is exhausted.  If the
*     keyword is present, THERE is .TRUE., otherwise it is .FALSE.
*     Since all cards images are in character format, type conversion
*     is performed.  An error status will be returned if the conversion
*     has failed.  If the keyword expected to be present more than
*     once, then the argument NOCCUR controls which occurrence will be
*     retrieved.  If a keyword is not found, then no error results and
*     the argument VALUE remains unmodified.
*
*     The name may be compound to permit reading of hierarchical
*     keywords.  This routine will probably only work for HISTORY,
*     COMMENT and ' ' (blank) if there is just one value given on the
*     line, i.e. only one "keyword = value" before any comment
*     marker.  An error will result otherwise.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the keyword whose value is required.  This may be
*        a compound name to handle hierarchical keywords, and it has
*        the form keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  The maximum number of
*        keywords per FITS card is 20.  Comparisons are performed in
*        uppercase and blanks are removed.  Each keyword must be no
*        longer than 8 characters.
*     NOCCUR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value of this argument specifies which occurrence of a
*        keyword should be used, if multiple ones are expected.  Any
*        value less than or equal to 1 indicates the first occurrence.
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If .TRUE., the keyword given by argument NAME is present,
*        regardless of the exit status.  Note THERE=.FALSE. whenever
*        there is no FITS extension.
*     VALUE = ? (Returned)
*        The value of the keyword.
*     COMENT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The comment associated with the keyword.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Notes:
*     - There is a routine for each of the data types character,
*     logical, integer, real and double precision: replace "x" in the
*     routine name by C, L, I, R or D as appropriate.
