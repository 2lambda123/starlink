	SUBROUTINE CON_AFHIR( NCARDS, HEADER, IMDES, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_AFHIR

*  Purpose:
*     Adds a FITS header to an IRAF image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_AFHIR( NCARDS, HEADER, IMDES, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The subroutine loops over the number of FITS lines or card images
*     adding each one to the 'user area' of the IRAF image. This cannot
*     be done except by using the SPP routine adline() as the file
*     containing the IRAF header information is a binary one.
*
*     Once the keyword 'END' is encountered, the subroutine returns to
*     the calling routine.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARDS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of 80-character card images to be copied.
*     HEADER( NCARDS ) = CHARACTER * ( 80 ) (Given)
*        The array of FITS headers to be parsed
*     IMDES = INTEGER (Given)
*        This is the image descriptor obtained in the calling routine
*        and required by the IRAF header-writing routines.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  External Routines Used:
*     ADLINE() is a routine written in SPP, the IRAF programming
*     language, which does the job of adding the header lines to the
*     image. The SPP routine uses the facilities available to the imfort
*     subroutine library, which is a subset of the facilities available
*     within the whole IRAF system.
*
*     This routine acts as a buffer for passing the array to the SPP
*     routine.
*
*        adline()
*     SPP program from NOAO.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The IRAF image file must be open for write access.
