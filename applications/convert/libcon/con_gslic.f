      SUBROUTINE CON_GSLIC( NAME, SLICE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_GSLIC

*  Purpose:
*     Find and remove any NDF slice specification from a name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_GSLIC( NAME, SLICE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A slice specification is taken to be anything between the first
*     opening parenthesis and the first closing parenthesis. No check is
*     made that these parenthesise occur at the same level of nesting.
*     That is, if NAME='(A,(B,C))' is supplied, the returned string
*     would be SLICE='(A,(B,C)'.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returtned)
*        The name to be checked. On exit, any NDF slice specification
*        contained in the name on entry, any remaining text to the right
*        of the slice specifier is shifted to the left in order to
*        remove the slice specified.
*     SLICE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The slice specification including opening and closing
*        parenthesise. If the input name contains no slice
*        specification, then SLICE is returned blank.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Check inherited global status.

*  Initialise the returned slice specifier.
      SLICE = ' '

*  Store the used length of the input name.
      NAMLEN = CHR_LEN( NAME )

*  Search for the first opening parenthesis.

*  If one was found, search for the first closing parenthesis following
*  the opening parenthesis just found.

*  If one was found, calculate the offset of the closing parenthesis
*  from the start of the string, rather than from the opening
*  parenthesis.
         IF( STOP .NE. 0 ) THEN
            STOP = STOP + START - 1

*  Extract the slice specifier from the supplied name.
