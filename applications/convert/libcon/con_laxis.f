      SUBROUTINE CON_LAXIS (ZEROPT, SCALE, NPTS, AXIS, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_LAXIS

*  Purpose:
*     Compute a linear axis.

*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_LAXIS (ZEROPT, SCALE, NPTS; AXIS; STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Compute a linear axis, given a zero point and a scale factor.

*  Arguments:
*     ZEROPT  =  REAL (Given)
*        Zero point.
*     SCALE  =  REAL (Given)
*        Scale factor.
*     NPTS  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of points in the axis.
*     AXIS(NPTS)  =  REAL (Returned)
*        Central radial velocity of each point in the axis (km/sec).
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     For each point in the axis
*       Compute the axis value.
*     end for
