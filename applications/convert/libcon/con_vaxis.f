*  Name:
*     CON_VAXIS

*  Purpose:
*     Fills the spectral axis.

*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_VAXIS( SPECTM, DOPPLR, VCORR, FCEN, FINC, FREST, NPTS;
*                     AXIS; STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Compute the spectral axis.

*  Arguments:
*     SPECTM  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Flag indicating whether the spectral axis is to be expressed
*        as a frequency or a radial velocity.  The options are:
*        FREQUENCY  -  frequency in KHz,
*        VELOCITY   -  radial velocity in km/sec.
*     DOPPLR  =  CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Flag indicating whether the radial velocity is to be computed
*        using the classical or relativistic formula.  The options are:
*        CLASSICAL    -  classical,
*        RELATIVISTIC -  relativistic.
*        This flag is ignored if the spectrum is expressed as a
*        frequency.
*     VCORR  =  REAL (Given)
*        Computed radial velocity correction to the chosen standard of
*        rest (km/sec).  Positive values indicate recession.
*     FCEN  =  REAL (Given)
*        Central frequency (Hz).
*     FINC  =  REAL (Given)
*        Frequency increment (Hz).
*     FREST  =  REAL (Given)
*        Rest frequency of the line (Hz).
*     NPTS  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of points in the axis.
*     AXIS(NPTS)  =  REAL (Returned)
*        Central radial velocity of each point in the axis (km/sec).
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     Compute the start frequency.
*     Compute the rest wavelength.
*     For each point in the axis
*       Compute the corresponding frequency.
*       If frequency units are required then
*         Set the axis value to the frequency.
*       else velocity units are required
*         Compute the wavelength.
*         If a classical doppler shift is required then
*           Compute the classical radial velocity.
*         else a relativistic doppler shift is required then
*           Compute the relativistic radial velocity.
*         end if
*         Set the axis value to the observed velocity correction minus
*         the correction to the standard of rest.
*       end if
*     end for
