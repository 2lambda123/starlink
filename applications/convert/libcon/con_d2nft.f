*+
*  Name:
*     CON_D2NFT

*  Purpose:
*     Write an NDF FITS extension card from a DST FITS component.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_D2NFT( PATH, NAME, TYPE, COMENT, OUTNDF, NPC, STRUCT,
*                     STNAME, NFITS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine serves CON_DST2N.  It creates or extends an NDF
*     FITS extension, by transferring to it information stored in a DST
*     file's FITS structure (and substructures).  FITS cards are written
*     using the fixed format.  Substructure objects are stored in blank
*     keyword headers that have the keyword=value syntax from column 10.
*     The start of a block of such headers can have a heading preceded
*     by a blank line when STNAME is not blank (and STRUCT is .TRUE.).

*  Arguments:
*     PATH = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The path of the FITS component in the DST FITS structure.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the FITS keyword to be written (also usually the
*        name of the component in the DST FITS structure).  If this is
*        blank, a blank header card is written.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The data type of the FITS structure primitive component.
*     COMENT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The comment associated with the FITS value.
*     OUTNDF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the output NDF including the path in the container
*        file.
*     NPC = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of significant characters in OUTNDF.
*     STRUCT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether or not the component was stored in a structure and so
*        is output in a blank comment card in La Palma
*        hierarchical-keyword style (since this is why this feature is
*        present).
*     STNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the structure in the DST FITS structure containing
*        a block of associated keywords.  It is used to write a heading
*        before the keywords are written as blank comments, provided
*        it is not null.  STNAME is ignored when STRUCT is .FALSE..
*     NFITS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of FITS headers in the output NDF FITS extension.
*     STATUS = INTEGER ({status_access_mode})
*        The global status.
