      SUBROUTINE CON_IFUF<T>( FD, EL, NOVPRE, SKIP, A, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_IFUFx

*  Purpose:
*     Reads a numeric array from an unformatted file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_IFUFx( FD, EL, NOVPRE, SKIP, A, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine reads a numeric array in character form from a
*     sequential unformatted file, and converts it to numbers.  File
*     records may be skipped before transfer of the array occurs.

*  Arguments:
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        File descriptor of the output unformatted file.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of array elements to process.
*     NOVPRE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of data values per record of the input file.  The
*        resulting number of longwords per record must not exceed 8191.
*     SKIP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of records to be skipped before reading the array.
*     A( EL ) = ? (Returned)
*        Output numeric array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric data type: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as appropriate. The
*     array returned from the routine must have the data type specified.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The unformatted file must be open for read access.
