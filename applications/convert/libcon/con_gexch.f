      SUBROUTINE CON_GEXCH( IGROUP, OEXT, OGROUP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_GEXCH

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a group of filenames based upon a group of NDF filenames.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_GEXCH( IGROUP, OEXT, OGROUP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine takes a GRP group containing a list of NDF filenames
*     and substitutes a specified file extension for the '.sdf' in the
*     name.  The new names are appended to an output group.  If there is
*     no '.sdf' extension, the new extension is appended to the
*     filenames in the GRP.  Any NDF sections are removed before each
*     file name is propagated to the new group.  Any directory path
*     to the NDF is also removed.

*  Arguments:
*     IGROUP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The GRP identifier containing the list of NDF filenames.
*     OEXT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The file extension for the output group.
*     OGROUP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The GRP identifier containing the list of filenames after the
*        substitution of the file extension, the extraction of any
*        section-defining text and removal of any directory path.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     -  This version uses the UNIX path delimiter explictely, until
*     there is PSX routine to do this.
*
*     [optional_subroutine_items]...

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The output group must already exist; it is not created by this
*     routine.
