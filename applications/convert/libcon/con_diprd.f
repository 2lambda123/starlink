      SUBROUTINE CON_DIPRD (UNIT, NPTS, NBREAK, BREAK, NMAX, WAVE,

*  Name:
*     CON_DIPRD

*  Purpose:
*     Reads the main data and axis arrays from a Dipso file, and
*     inserts bad pixels at the Dipso break points.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      CALL CON_DIPRD (UNIT, NPTS, NBREAK, BREAK, NMAX, WAVE, FLUX, 
*    :                      WAVE1, FLUX1, NCOR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine reads in the wavelength and flux data arrays from
*     a file produced by the DIPSO `WRITE' command.  These data arrays
*     contain `breaks' where one or more bad data elements have been
*     removed. This routine estimates how many values have been removed
*     from the initial data by comparing the gap in the wavelength data
*     to the wavelength increment within the previous `good patch' of 
*     data. At least one bad pixel is inserted at every break point.
*     The input wavelength and flux data are always of Fortran REAL 
*     type,  the output data arrays are of HDS type '_REAL'.

*  Arguments:
*     UNIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Logical unit number for Dipso file.
*     NPTS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of elements in original Dipso data.
*     NBREAK = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of breaks in original Dipso data.
*     BREAK( NBREAK ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Array containing position of break points.
*     NMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        Size of output arrays for padded data.
*     WAVE( NPTS ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Original wavelength array in Dipso data.
*     FLUX( NPTS ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Original flux array in Dipso data.
*     WAVE1( NPTS ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Wavelength array with interpolated values at bad pixels.
*     FLUX1(NPTS) = REAL (Returned)
*        Flux array with bad values inserted at breaks.
*     NCOR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of data elements after insertion of bad pixels.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The Dipso file must have been opened, and the Title and break
*     information read.
