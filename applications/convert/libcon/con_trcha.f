      SUBROUTINE CON_TRCHA( FROM, TO, EL, ARRAY, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_TRCHA

*  Purpose:
*     Translates the specified characters in an array of strings.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_TRCHA( FROM, TO, EL, ARRAY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine translate a specified set of characters within each
*     element in an array of strings.  The character translation is
*     controlled by the translation table given by the character strings
*     FROM and TO.   Any characters not appearing in the translation
*     table are left unchanged.  If the strings FROM and TO are unequal
*     in length, STATUS is returned set to SAI__ERROR.

*  Arguments:
*     FROM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The characters to be translated.
*     TO = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The translation values for each of the characters in the FROM
*        argument.  The lengths of the FROM and To arguments must be the
*        same.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in the character array.
*     ARRAY( EL ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The array of strings to be translated.  Any character matching
*        one of the characters specified in the FROM argument is
*        converted to the corresponding character specified in the TO
*        argument.  All other characters are left unchanged.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
