*  Name:
*     CON_SPCPY

*  Purpose:
*     Copies the arrays of a SPECX map into a simple data cube.

*  Language:
*     Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_SPCPY( MAPX, MAPY, MAP, NSPEC, SPSIZE, SPECTR; CUBE;
*                     STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Copy the arrays of a SPECX map into a simple data cube.  Rows in
*     the cube corresponding to positions on sky where a spectrum was
*     not observed are filled with bad values.

*  Arguments:
*     MAPX = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of points along the X-axis of the grid of observed
*        positions.
*     MAPY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of points along the X-axis of the grid of observed
*        positions.
*     MAP( MAPX, MAPY ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Grid of observed positions.  The value of each grid point
*        either indicates the location of the spectrum at the point
*        or is a flag indicating that no observation was made.
*     NSPEC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The total number of spectra observed in the grid.
*     SPSIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of points in each spectrum.
*     SPECTR( SPSIZE, NSPEC ) = REAL (Given)
*        Array holding all the observed spectra.
*     CUBE( MAPX, MAPY, SPSIZE ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The returned data cube containing the observation.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
