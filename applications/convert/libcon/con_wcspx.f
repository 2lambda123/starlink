      SUBROUTINE CON_WCSPX( INDF, IMAP, OBSLON, OBSLAT, VAR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CON_WCSPX

*  Purpose:
*     Add a WCS component to an NDF created by SPECX2NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CON_WCSPX( INDF, IMAP, OBSLON, OBSLAT, VAR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine adds a WCS component to the output NDF holdiong a
*     FrameSet in which the current Frame is a 3D Frame with RA on axis 1,
*     DEC on axis 2, and frequency on axis 3. The parameters defining the
*     axes are read from the SPECX extensions in the supplied SPECX map,
*     except for the observatory location which is provided by the caller.
*
*     Also calculates and returns a constant variance value based on the
*     Tsys value in the SPECX extension.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier for the NDF created by SPECX2NDF.
*     IMAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier for the SPECX map file.
*     OBSLON = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The geodetic longitude of the observatory. Radians, positive east.
*     OBSLAT = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The geodetic latitude of the observatory. Radians, positive north.
*     VAR = REAL (Returned)
*        A constant variance valued derived from the values in the SPECX
*        extension.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - Various assumptions are made about the meaning of several items
*     in the SPECX extensions. These are described in the code comments.
*     - Double Sideband is always assumed

*  History:
*     27-JAN-2003 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*      6-AUG-2004 (TIMJ):
*        Convert to use DSBSpecFrame
*      14-AUG-2005 (TIMJ):
*        Minor tweak to multiplication statement to make it standards compliant.
*      10-JAN-2008 (DSB):
*        - For increased precision, store the Epoch directly in the SkyFrame 
*        using AST_SETD rather than indirectly via the MJD-OBS FITS header. 
*        - Use AST attributes ObsLon/Lat instead of GeoLon/Lat
*        - Convert observation date from UT1 (sed by SPECX) to TDB (used
*        by AST) before storing it in the output WCS.
*        - Asume that the SPECX axis is in the rest frame given by the
*        bottom 4 bits of LSRFLG rather than in the source's rest frame.
*      11-JAN-2008 (DSB):
*        - The specx user guide says that JFINC is a topocentric value
*        and JFCEN is a source frame value. So convert JFINC from topo to
*        source before using it. This involves backing out of yesterdays 
*        change that assumed the SPECX axis (i.e. both JFCEN and JFINC) was 
*        in the rest frame given by the bottom 4 bits of LSRFLG.
*        - Use the correct definition of the source velocity (radio,
*        optical or relativistic) as read from bits 5 and 6 of LSRFLG.
*      8-FEB-2008 (DSB):
*        Added argument VAR.
*      21-FEB-2008 (DSB):
*        The bulk of the working has been moved out to ATL_WCSPX.
*      25-FEB-2008 (DSB):
*        New interface for ATL_WCSPX.
*      16-APR-2008 (DSB):
*        ATL_WCSPX now requires CRPIX rather than DIM.
