The \CONVERT\ package contains utilities for converting data files
between Starlink's Extensible {\em n}-dimensional Data Format
\xref{(NDF)}{sun33}{abstract},
which is used by most Starlink applications, and a number of other common
data formats.
Using these utilities, astronomers can process their data selecting the best 
applications from a variety of Starlink or other packages.
\par
Most of the \CONVERT\ utilities may be run from the shell or \ICLref\ in 
the normal way, or invoked automatically by the NDF library's `on-the-fly' 
data-conversion system, but there are also 
\IDLref\
procedures for handling NDFs from within IDL.}

%  Name:
%     SST.TEX

%  Purpose:
%     Define LaTeX commands for laying out Starlink routine descriptions.

%  Language:
%     LaTeX

%  Type of Module:
%     LaTeX data file.

%  Description:
%     This file defines LaTeX commands which allow routine documentation
%     produced by the SST application PROLAT to be processed by LaTeX and
%     by LaTeX2html. The contents of this file should be included in the
%     source prior to any statements that make of the sst commands.

%  Notes:
%     The commands defined in the style file html.sty provided with LaTeX2html 
%     are used. These should either be made available by using the appropriate
%     sun.tex (with hypertext extensions) or by putting the file html.sty 
%     on your TEXINPUTS path (and including the name as part of the  
%     documentstyle declaration).

%  Authors:
%     RFWS: R.F. Warren-Smith (STARLINK)
%     PDRAPER: P.W. Draper (Starlink - Durham University)
%     MJC: Malcolm J. Currie (STARLINK)

%  History:
%     10-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
%        Original version.
%     10-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
%        Added the implementation status section.
%     12-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
%        Added support for the usage section and adjusted various spacings.
%     8-DEC-1994 (PDRAPER):
%        Added support for simplified formatting using LaTeX2html.
%     1995 October 4 (MJC):
%        Added goodbreaks and pagebreak[3] in various places to improve
%        pages breaking before headings, not immediately after.
%        Corrected banner width.

\section{\label{introduction}Introduction}

If life were simple there would only be one data format, but in reality
there are numerous formats for storing {\em{n}}-dimensional astronomical data
associated with various software packages.   In Starlink we have not
been immune to this, having the original INTERIM BDF, HDS IMAGE format,
and \Figaroref\ DSTs to name but three.  However, Starlink is now taking the
novel approach of supporting different packages sharing a common data
format---the
\xref{NDF}{sun33}{abstract}\latex{\footnote{
See SUN/33 for an introduction to the NDF.}}
(Extensible {\em{n}}-Dimensional-data format)---which most Starlink packages
are already using.

The purpose of \CONVERT\ is the interchange of data files
to and from the NDF.  Thus it enables astronomers to select the best
applications from a variety of packages, including those originating
abroad like 
\IRAFref.
In addition it assists packages that wish to move to
using the NDF.

\CONVERT\ is available from all three UNIX platforms supported by
Starlink.  The supported conversions are currently as follows: 

%\begin{latexonly}
\begin{center}
\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{l@{ -- }p{125mm}}

{\bf \htmlref{UNF2NDF}{UNF2NDF}}

\end{tabular}
\end{small}
\end{center}

In addition there are FITS readers within 
\KAPPAref \latex{ (see SUN/95)}
which will convert FITS files and tapes to NDFs.
These are more tolerant of `almost FITS' files, but lack support for
IMAGE and BINTABLE extensions.

\IDLref\
procedures for handling NDFs and other methods of converting 
\htmlref{NDFs to IDL}{app_idl}
format are described in 
\latex{Appendix~\ref{app_idl} of} this document.

Starting up the \CONVERT\ package will also set up defaults for the
\htmlref{automatic NDF conversion facilities}{sect_auto}
\latex{(described in Section \ref{sect_auto})} to enable applications 
which use the NDF library to read and write most of the file formats handled 
by the \CONVERT\ package, and some others.

The various formats supported by \CONVERT\ do not have
one-to-one correspondence and therefore in general it is not possible to
apply a forward and reverse conversion and finish with a duplicate of
the initial data file.  This hysteresis is particularly likely when
starting with an NDF, since many simpler formats have no way of storing
certain NDF data items, like variance and axis widths.  However, if you
are dealing with a simple file containing just a data array and linear
axis centres, then it should be possible to avoid loss of information except
with \GIFref\ and \TIFFref\ formats which will reduce the absolute data values to 256
greyscale levels.

{\sl Note -- the input data file is not deleted or altered in any way.}

\newpage 
\section[Running {\small \bf CONVERT}]{\label{running_convert}Running \BCONVERT}

\subsection[Starting {\small CONVERT} from the UNIX shell]
{\xlabel{starting_convert_from_the_unix_shell}
Starting \BCONVERT\ from the UNIX shell}

The command \texttt{convert} defines \CONVERT\ commands from
the UNIX shell.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
      % convert
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize 
Note that the \texttt{\%} is the UNIX shell's prompt which you do not type.

A message similar to:
\small
\begin{verbatim}

   CONVERT commands are now available -- (Version 1.0, 1997 August)

   Defaults for automatic NDF conversion are set.

   Type conhelp for help on CONVERT commands.
   Type "showme sun55" to browse the hypertext documentation.

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize 
will be displayed. You will then be able to mix \CONVERT\ and UNIX commands.

The \texttt{convert} command is defined by the Starlink startup procedures to
`source' file \texttt{convert.csh} in the \CONVERT\ executables directory. 
Non-Starlink sites must make their own arrangements.

\subsection[Starting {\small CONVERT} from {\small \bf ICL}]
{\xlabel{starting_convert_from_icl}
Starting \BCONVERT\ from ICL}
To start \ICLref, type:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % icl
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
You will see any messages produced by system and user procedures, followed
by the \texttt{ICL>} prompt, something like the following.

\small
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
ICL (UNIX) Version 3.1-5 20/05/97

Loading installed package definitions...

  - Type HELP package_name for help on specific Starlink packages
  -   or HELP PACKAGES for a list of all Starlink packages
  - Type HELP [command] for help on ICL and its commands

ICL>
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
\normalsize
Then, to make the \CONVERT\ commands known to the command language, type:
\small
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
ICL> CONVERT
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
\normalsize
This will produce a \CONVERT\ startup message similar to:
\small
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
CONVERT commands are now available -- (Version 1.0, 1997 August)

Defaults for automatic NDF conversion are set.

Type CONHELP or HELP CONVERT for help on CONVERT commands.
Type "showme sun55" to browse the hypertext documentation.
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
\normalsize

The ICL command \texttt{CONVERT} is defined by the standard Starlink ICL login
files to \texttt{LOAD} file \texttt{convert.icl} in the \CONVERT\ executables 
directory. Non-Starlink sites must make their own arrangements.

\subsection[Issuing {\small CONVERT} Commands]
{\xlabel{issuing_convert_commands}
Issuing \BCONVERT\ Commands}
Having initialised \CONVERT\ you are now ready to issue a
\CONVERT\ command. To run an application you can just give
its name (or its name preceded by \texttt{con\_}\footnote{The
\texttt{con\_<name>}
form is defined for use where there may be confusion between commands of the
same name from different packages.})---you will be prompted for any required 
{\em parameters}. 
Alternatively, you may enter parameter values on the command line
specified by position or by keyword.  If you want to override any
defaulted parameters, then you specify the parameter's value on the
command line.  Note that {\em from UNIX the commands are in lowercase}, whereas
from \ICL\ the case does not matter.

Most \CONVERT\ applications can be run as simply as:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     <application> <in> <out>
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
where \texttt{$<$application$>$} is the application's name, \texttt{$<$in$>$}
is the input file, and \texttt{$<$out$>$} is the output
file following the conversion.  For instance, from the UNIX shell,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % dst2ndf old new
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
or, from ICL,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> DST2NDF old new
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
both instruct the application \htmlref{DST2NDF}{DST2NDF} to convert the
DST file called \texttt{old.dst} to the NDF called \texttt{new.sdf}.  
Note that for UNIX, the case of the filename is significant.

The following example has the same effect as those immediately above,
only this time you are prompted for the filenames needed by DST2NDF. 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> DST2NDF
     IN - Name of Figaro (.DST) file to be converted /' '/ > old
     OUT - Name of output NDF /@f1/ > new
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The value between the \texttt{/ /} delimiters is a suggested default.  You
can choose to accept the suggestion by pressing carriage return. 

The simple usage, (\texttt{<application> <in> <out>}), will usually produce a
result but many applications have additional parameters which you can set to
give finer control over the conversion. See the 
\htmlref{application specifications}{app_full}
\latex{in Appendix~\ref{app_full}} for details of the options available.

You can find details of how to use parameters for controlling Starlink program
options
\latexelsehtml{in Section~4 of SUN/95}{\xref{in SUN/95}{sun95}{se_param}}
or in
\latexelsehtml{Chapter~8}{section `Specifying Parameter Values'}
of 
\xref{SG/4}{sg4}{}.
However, you should be able to get along using intuition alone, or, perhaps 
by consulting the
\htmlref{application specifications}{app_full} 
\latex{in Appendix~\ref{app_full}}, which include usage, parameters,
examples and details of the conversion process.

In most cases, one invocation of a \CONVERT\ application is required for each 
file conversion but in some cases, inputs may be defined as 
\xref{`GROUPS'}{sun150}{} of names, including wildcards (see the 
\htmlref{application specifications}{app_full} for details).

\subsection{\xlabel{obtaining_help}Obtaining Help}
You can get the top-level help information for \CONVERT\  by typing:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % conhelp
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
from the UNIX shell, or:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> CONHELP
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
from ICL. (You can also access \CONVERT\ help from ICL by using the ICL command,
HELP.)

The help topics are mostly detailed descriptions of the applications
but also include global information on matters such as using parameters. 
{\em{e.g.}}\ the following command gives help on the application
\htmlref{UNF2NDF}{UNF2NDF}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % conhelp unf2ndf
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

If you have commenced running an application you can still access the
help library whenever you are prompted for a parameter; you enter \texttt{?}.
Here is an example.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     NOPEREC - Number of data values per output record /512/ > ?

     NDF2UNF

       Parameters

         NOPEREC = _INTEGER (Read)
            The number of data values per record of the output file.  It
            should be in the range 1 to 8191, unless the array is double
            precision, when the upper limit is 4095.  The suggested
            default is the current value. [The first dimension of the NDF]

     NOPEREC - Number of data values per output record /512/ > 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{\xlabel{sun55_se_hypertext}Hypertext Help\label{se_hypertext}}

A modified version of this document exists in hypertext form.  One way
to access it is to use the
\xref{\texttt{showme}}{sun188}{displaying_parts_of_documents} command

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % showme sun55
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and a Web browser will appear, presenting the index to the hypertext
form of this document.  The hypertext permits easy location of
referenced documents and applications.

\newpage 
\section{\label{sect_auto}\xlabel{sect_auto}Automatic Format Conversion with
the NDF Library}
\xref{SSN/20}{ssn20}{} describes a system incorporated into the 
\xref{NDF library}{sun33}{}
routines which enables applications written to read or write NDFs to handle
any arbitrary `foreign' format for which a conversion utility can be defined.
The system operates via environment variables which define the set of permitted 
conversions and the commands required to do them.

\subsection{\xlabel{the_default_conversion_commands}The Default Conversion Commands}
\CONVERT\ startup will define defaults for the NDF-conversion environment 
variables which permit automatic conversion of files in the formats handled by 
\CONVERT\ (except for AST, IRCAM, PGM. SPECX and FITS tapes).
It also allows data compression. 

\begin{htmlonly}
The list of format names and associated filename extensions defined by 
\CONVERT\ is set out in the table below---the filename extensions tell the 
system which format the file is in.
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
The list of format names and associated filename extensions
defined by \CONVERT\ is set out in Table~\ref{tab:formats}---the filename 
extensions tell the system which format the file is in. For the unformatted 
and ASCII conversions the format names and extensions are somewhat arbitrary.
\end{latexonly}
This list will nullify any existing list so private conversions must be added
{\em after\/} \CONVERT\ startup.

For the unformatted and ASCII conversions the format names and
extensions are somewhat arbitrary.  The FITS and STREAM formats have
synonym file extensions for the conversion to NDF.  The standard file
extension is required for the conversion to the foreign format.

\end{table}

\begin{latexonly}
Table~\ref{tab:conversions} also contains a column headed `Variable'.
Most of the command lines issued to do the automatic conversion will include 
the translation of an environment variable named 
NDF\_FROM\_\-{\em fmt}\_\-PARS or NDF\_TO\_{\em fmt}\_PARS as appropriate
(where {\em fmt} is the format name).
This may be used to give additional parameters to the command if you do not
want to define a completely new command for yourself. 
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
The table also contains a column headed `Variable'.
Most of the command lines issued to do the automatic conversion will include 
the translation of an environment variable named NDF\_FROM\_{\em fmt}\_PARS or

This may be used to give additional parameters to the command if you do not
want to define a completely new command for yourself. 
\end{htmlonly}
Where the `Variable' column contains a tick, the variable {\em must} be used 
to supply the SHAPE parameter; where it contains a cross, additional parameters
cannot be specified.

For example, suppose application \texttt{rdndf} uses the NDF library to read
one NDF (named by the first parameter) and write another (named by the second
parameter). This application could be made to read a TEXT file 
(\texttt{data.txt})
containing the required values for a 50 $\times$ 10 data array, and write its 
results as a FITS file (\texttt{output.fit}) as follows:

\small
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
% convert
CONVERT commands are now available -- (Version 1.4, 2001 November)

Defaults for automatic NDF conversion are set.

Type conhelp for help on CONVERT commands.
Type "showme sun55" to browse the hypertext documentation.

% setenv NDF_FROM_TEXT_PARS 'SHAPE=[50,10]'
% rdndf data.txt output.fit
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
\normalsize
\bigskip

The order of the formats in the tables also defines a search path.  If
you omit the file extension, the system will search for an NDF of that
name.  If that is absent, it will try a \texttt{.fit} FITS file.  If neither
are present it tries an \IRAFref\ file, and so on. The recognised formats and
their order is defined through the environment variable
NDF\_FORMATS\_IN.  The shell \texttt{convert} startup defines
NDF\_FORMATS\_IN as given below.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     'FITS(.fit),FIGARO(.dst),IRAF(.imh),STREAM(.das),UNFORMATTED(.unf),
     UNF0(.dat),ASCII(.asc),TEXT(.txt),GIF(.gif),TIFF(.tif),GASP(.hdr),
     COMPRESSED(.sdf.Z),GZIP(.sdf.gz),FITS(.fits),FITS(.fts),FITS(.FTS),
     FITS(.FITS),FITS(.FIT),FITS(.lilo),FITS(.lihi),
     FITS(.silo),FITS(.sihi),FITS(.mxlo),FITS(.mxhi),
     FITS(.rilo),FITS(.rihi),FITS(.vdlo),FITS(.vdhi),STREAM(.str)'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

but from ICL the \texttt{CONVERT} command does not define the synonyms due 
to a limitation of ICL.  Thus NDF\_FORMATS\_IN is defined to be the
following. 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     'FITS(.fit),FIGARO(.dst),IRAF(.imh),STREAM(.das),UNFORMATTED(.unf),
      UNF0(.dat),ASCII(.asc),TEXT(.txt),GIF(.gif),TIFF(.tif),GASP(.hdr),
      COMPRESSED(.sdf.Z),GZIP(.sdf.gz)'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

When creating an output file, there is a similar list of recognised
formats.  The \CONVERT\ startup procedures define NDF\_FORMATS\_OUT
as follows.

\small
\begin{verbatim}

\section[Specifications of {\small \bf CONVERT} Applications]
{\label{app_full}Specifications of \BCONVERT\ Applications}
\subsection{\xlabel{explanatory_notes}Explanatory Notes}

The {\em Parameters\/} section \label{app_parameters}
lists the application's parameters, with the format:

\begin{verbatim}
     name  =  type (access)
        description
\end{verbatim}

The description entry has a notation scheme to indicate 
normally defaulted parameters, {\it i.e.}\ those for which there will
be no prompt.
For such parameters a matching pair of square brackets (\verb![]!)
terminates the description.  The content between the brackets mean
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{[]}]
Empty brackets means that the default is created dynamically
by the application, and may depend on the values of other parameters.
Therefore, the default cannot be given explicitly.
\item[\texttt{[,]}]
As above, but there are two default values that are created dynamically.
\item[\texttt{[}{\rm default}\texttt{]}]
Occasionally, a description of the default is given in normal type.
\item[\texttt{[default]}]
If the brackets contain a value in teletype-fount, this is the explicit
default value.
\end{description}

There is also a {\em Usage\/} entry.   \label{app_usage}
This shows how the  application is invoked from the command line.   It
lists the positional parameters in order followed by any prompted
keyword parameters using  a \mbox{``KEYWORD=?''} syntax.  Defaulted
keyword parameters do not appear.  Positional parameters that are
normally defaulted are indicated by being enclosed in square brackets.  
Keyword ({\it i.e.}\ not positional) parameters are needed where the
number of parameters are large, and usually occur because they depend on
the value of another parameter.  An example should clarify.
\smallskip

\begin{verbatim}
     ndf2ascii in out [comp] [reclen] noperec=?
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\smallskip

IN, OUT, COMP, and RECLEN are all positional
parameters.  Only IN, and OUT would be prompted if not given
on the command line. The remaining parameter, NOPEREC, depends on the
value of another parameter (it is FIXED), and will be prompted for when
FIXED is \texttt{TRUE}. 

The {\em Examples\/} section  \label{app_example}
shows how to run the application from the command line.  More often
you'll enter the command name and just some of the parameters, and be
prompted for the rest. 

Examples give command lines as accepted by the tasks themselves.  From
the UNIX shell, {\em metacharacters\/} (notably \texttt{[}, \texttt{]} and
\texttt{"})
{\em must be escaped or enclosed in single quotes}.  For example:

\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
ascii2ndf ngc253q.dat ngc253 q shape='[100,60]'
fits2ndf '"abc.fit,def.fits"' 'fgh,ijk"' fmtcnv='"F,T"' noproexts

      }
   }
   \sstnotes{
      The details of the conversion are as follows:
      \ssthitemlist{

         \sstitem
            the ASCII-file array is written to the NDF array as
            selected by COMP.  When the NDF is being modified, the shape
            of the new component must match that of the NDF.

         \sstitem
            If the input file contains a FITS-like header, and a new
            NDF is created, {\it i.e.}\ COMP = \texttt{"Data"}, the header 
            records are placed within the NDF's FITS extension.  
            This enables more
            than one array (input file) to be used to form an NDF.  Note
            that the data array must be created first to make a valid NDF,
            and it's the FITS structure associated with that array that is
            wanted.  Indeed the application prevents you from doing
            otherwise.

         \sstitem
            The FITS-like header defines the properties of the NDF as
            follows:
            \begin{itemize}
            \item BITPIX defines the data type: 8 gives \_BYTE, 16 produces
            \_WORD, 32 makes \_INTEGER, $-$32 gives \_REAL, and $-$64 generates
            \_DOUBLE.  For the first two, if there is an extra header
            record with the keyword UNSIGNED and logical value T, these
            types become \_UBYTE and \_UWORD respectively.  UNSIGNED is
            non-standard, since unsigned integers would not follow in a
            proper FITS file.  However, here it is useful to enable
            unsigned types to be input into an NDF.  UNSIGNED may be
            created by this application's sister, NDF2ASCII.  BITPIX is
            ignored for QUALITY data; type \_UBYTE is used.
            \item NAXIS, and NAXIS{\em{n}} define the shape of the NDF.
            \item The TITLE, LABEL, and BUNIT are copied to the NDF
            TITLE, LABEL, and UNITS NDF components respectively.
            \item The CDELT{\em{n}}, CRVAL{\em{n}}, CTYPE{\em{n}}, and 
            CUNIT{\em{n}} keywords make
            linear axis structures within the NDF.  CUNIT{\em{n}} define the
            axis units, and the axis labels are assigned to CTYPE{\em{n}}. 
            If some are missing, pixel co-ordinates are used for those
            axes.
            \item BSCALE and BZERO in a FITS extension are ignored.
            \item BLANK is not used to indicate which input array values
            should be assigned to a
            \xref{standard bad value}{sun95}{se_badmasking}.
            \item END indicates the last header record unless it
            terminates a dummy header, and the actual data is in an
            extension.
            \end{itemize}

         \sstitem
            Other data item such as HISTORY, data ORIGIN, and axis
            widths are not supported, because the text file has a simple
            structure to enable a diverse set of input files to be
            converted to NDFs, and to limitations of the standard FITS
            header.

            the direct-access file's array is written to the NDF array
            as selected by COMP.  When the NDF is being modified, the
            shape of the new component must match that of the NDF.  This
            enables more than one array (input file) to be used to form an
            NDF.  Note that the data array must be created first to make a
            valid NDF.  Indeed the application prevents you from doing
            otherwise.

            Other data items such as axes are not supported, because of
            the direct-access file's simple structure.

   FITS2NDF
}{
   Converts FITS files into NDFs
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application converts one or more files in the \FITSref\ format
      into {\NDFref}s.  It can process an arbitrary FITS file to produce an
      NDF, using NDF extensions to store information conveyed in table
      and image components of the FITS file.  While no information is
      lost, in many common cases this would prove inconvenient
      especially as no meaning is attached to the NDF extension
      components.  Therefore, FITS2NDF recognises certain data products
      (currently \htmladdnormallink{IUE Final Archive}{http://www.vilspa.esa.es/iue/iuefa.html}, 
      \htmladdnormallink{INES}{http://ines.laeff.esa.es/}, 
      \htmladdnormallink{ISO}{http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es/users/idc/IDC.html},
      and \htmladdnormallink{2dF}{http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/2df/}), and provides
      tailored conversions that map the FITS data better on to the NDF
      components.  For instance, a FITS IMAGE extension storing data
      errors will have its data array transferred to the NDF's VARIANCE
      (after being squared).  In addition, FITS2NDF can restore
      NDFs converted to FITS by the sister task \htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS}.

      A more general facility is also provided to associate specified
      FITS extensions with NDF components by means of entries in a file
      (see the EXTABLE parameter).

      Details of the supported special formats and rules for processing
      them are given in topic 
      \htmlref{\texttt{"}Special Formats\texttt{"}}{special_formats}; 
      the general-case
      processing rules are described in the 
      \htmlref{\texttt{"}Notes\texttt{"}}{fits2ndf_notes}.

      Both NDF and FITS use the term extension, and they mean different
      things.  Thus to avoid confusion in the descriptions below, the term
      `sub-file' is used to refer to a FITS IMAGE, TABLE or BINTABLE Header
      and Data Unit (HDU).

            CRPIX\textit{i}, CD\textit{i\_j}, and is the
            system commonly used by IRAF. It is described in the document
            \textit{World Coordinate Systems Representations Within the FITS

            {http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.html}\\ \latex{
            (\texttt{http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.html})}.
            It is very similar to \texttt{"FITS-IRAF"} but supports a wider 
            range of projections and co-ordinate systems. Once the standard
            has been agreed, this encoding should be understood by any 
            \texttt{FITS-WCS} compliant software and it is likely to be
            adopted widely for FITS data in future. 

         \sstitem
            \texttt{"FITS-PC"} --- This uses keywords CRVAL\textit{i},
            CDELT\textit{i}, CRPIX\textit{i}, PC\textit{iiijjj}, 
            \textit{etc}, as described in a previous (now superseded) draft of

            (amongst others), so its use will facilitate data exchange with
            AIPS. This encoding uses CROTA\textit{i} and CDELT\textit{i}
            keywords to describe axis rotation and scaling.

            loss-free method for transferring WCS information between

         which case the value actually used is the first in the list for
         which corresponding keywords can be found in the FITS header.

         A FITS header may contain keywords from more than one of these
         encodings, in which case it is possible for the encodings to be
         inconsistent with each other. This may happen for instance if
         an application modifies the keyword associated with one encoding
         but fails to make equivalent modifications to the others.

         If a null
         parameter value (\texttt{!}) is supplied for ENCODINGS, then an attempt
         is made to determine the most reliable encoding to use as follows. If
         both native and non-native encodings are available, then the
         first non-native encoding to be found which is inconsistent with the
         native encoding is used. If all encodings are consistent, then the

          There may be more than one component specifier record for a given
          component, the sub-file specifiers will be concatenated. A
          sub-file specifier may not span records and only the transformation
          code specified by the last record for the component will be
          effective.

        \textbf{NDFNAMES records} have the format:
          \begin{quote}
          \texttt{NDFNAMES \textit{name\_list}}
          \end{quote}
           Where \texttt{\textit{name\_list}} is a list of names for the NDFs
           to be created, one
           for each sub-file set specified by the component specifier lines.
           The names are separated by commas. If any of the names are omitted,
           the last name specified is assumed to be a root name to which an
           integer counter is to be added until a new name is found.  If no
           names are specified, \texttt{EXTN\_SET} is used as the root name.
           For example,  \texttt{NDFNAMES NDF,,SET\_}
           would result in NDFs named NDF1, NDF2, SET\_1, SET\_2 \textit{etc.}
           up to the given number of sub-file sets.

           There may be multiple NDFNAMES records, the names will be
           concatenated.  A name may not span records and a comma as the last
           non-blank character indicates an omitted name. 

           If there is only one sub-file set, \textit{name\_list} may be
           `\texttt{*}',
           in which case the NDF will be created at the top level of the output
           file.
           \medskip

        \textbf{Directive records} have \texttt{\#} in column 1 and will
           generally be treated
           as comments and ignored.  An exception is a record starting with
           `\texttt{\#END}', which may optionally be used to terminate the file.
        
        Each HDU of the FITS file is processed in turn. If it matches one 
        of the sub-file specifiers in the table, it is used to create the 
        specified component of the appropriate NDF in the output file;
        otherwise the next HDU is processed. The table is searched in
        sub-file set order.
        If a table entry is matched it is removed from the table; this
        means that the same FITS sub-file specifier may be repeated for
        another NDF component but each FITS HDU can only be used once. 
        If sub-file specifiers remain unmatched at the end, a warning
        message is displayed.
        \bigskip

        A simple example of an EXTABLE is:
        \begin{quote} 
          \texttt{\# A simple example\\
          DATA;0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\
          \#END}
        \end{quote}
        The primary HDU and sub-files 1--6 of the FITS file will be written
        as the DATA components of NDFs EXTN\_SET1--EXTN\_SET7 within the HDS
        container file specified by the OUT parameter.

        A contrived example, showing more of the facilities, is:
        \begin{quote}
          \texttt{\# A contrived example\\
          NDFNAMES obs\_\\
          DATA; 1, EXTNAME=IM4, IM7; none\\
          VARIANCE; 2,im5, im8\\
          EXTN.CAL;3 ,,[extname=cal,extver=2]\\
          \#END}
        \end{quote}
        The HDS container file specified by the OUT parameter will contain
        three NDFs, the NDFNAMES record specifies that they will be named
        OBS\_1, OBS\_2 and OBS\_3.

        NDF OBS\_1 will have its DATA component created from the first
        extension  (HDU 1) of the FITS file specified by the IN parameter,
        and its VARIANCE from the second.  NDF OBS\_1 will have an extension
        named CAL created from the third FITS extension.

        NDF OBS\_2 has DATA and VARIANCE components created from the FITS
        sub-files whose EXTNAME keywords have the value IM4 and IM5
        respectively; no CAL extension is created in OBS\_2.

        OBS\_3 DATA and VARIANCE are created from FITS sub-files named IM7 and
        IM8 and the CAL extension from the FITS sub-file whose EXTNAME and
        EXTVER keywords have values \texttt{`CAL'} and \texttt{2} respectively.

        In all cases, if the PROFITS parameter is TRUE, the NDF's FITS
        extension will be created from the header of the sub-file
        associated with the DATA component of the NDF. It will have the
        form of a primary header and may include cards inherited from the
        primary header \texttt{[!]}

         This specifies whether or not format conversion will occur.
         The conversion applies the values of the FITS keywords BSCALE
         and BZERO to the FITS data to generate the `true' data values.
         This applies to IMAGE extensions, as well as the primary data
         array.  If BSCALE and BZERO are not given in the FITS header,
         they are taken to be 1.0 and 0.0 respectively.

         If FMTCNV=\texttt{"FALSE"}, the HDS type of the data array in the NDF
         will be the equivalent of the FITS data format on tape
         ({\em{e.g.}}\ BITPIX = 16 creates a \_WORD array).  If \texttt{"TRUE"},
         the data array in the NDF will be converted from the FITS data
         type to \_REAL or \_DOUBLE in the NDF.

         The special value FMTCNV=\texttt{"Native"} is a variant of \texttt{"FALSE"}, 
         that in addition creates a scaled form of NDF array, provided
         the array values are scaled through BSCALE and/or BZERO 
         keywords (\emph{i.e.} the keywords' values are not the null 1.0 
         and 0.0 respectively).  This NDF scaled array contains the 
         unscaled data values, and the scale and offset.

         The actual NDF data type for FMTCNV=\texttt{"TRUE"}, and the data 
         type after applying the scale and offset for FMTCNV=\texttt{"NATIVE"}
         are both specified by parameter TYPE.  However, if TYPE is a
         blank string or null ({\tt{!}}), then the choice of floating-point
         data type depends on the number of significant digits
         in the BSCALE and BZERO keywords.

         FMTCNV may be a list of comma-separated values, enclosed in
	 double quotes, to be applied to each conversion in turn. An
	 error results if more values than the number of input FITS
	 files are supplied.  If too few are given, the last value in

         construct at the end of the name is assumed to be

         \texttt{keyword=value} pair is allowed here.  Note also that if a

         at the end of the filename, you can put a null sub-file specifier 
         \texttt{"[]"} after it.

         Indirection may occur

         Other types of modification can also occur so OUT = \texttt{"x$*$"}

         Here are details of the processing of standard items from the
         the FITS header, listed by FITS keyword.

            \sstitem
            CRVAL\textit{n}, CDELT\textit{n}, CRPIX\textit{n}, CTYPE\textit{n},

            ENCODINGS).
            \sstitem
            OBJECT, LABEL, BUNIT --- if present are equated to the NDF's
            title, label, and units components respectively.
            \sstitem
            LBOUND\textit{n} --- if present, this specifies the pixel origin
            for the $\textit{n}^{\rm th}$ dimension.
         }
         \sstitem
         Additional sub-files within the FITS files are converted into
         extensions within the NDF if parameter PROEXTS is \texttt{TRUE}.
         These extensions are named FITS\_EXT\_\textit{m} for the 
         $\textit{m}^{\rm th}$ sub-file.
         \sstitem
         An IMAGE sub-file is treated like the primary data array, and
         follows the rules give above. However, the resultant NDF is an
         extension of the main NDF.
         \sstitem
         A BINTABLE or TABLE sub-file is converted into a structure
         of type TABLE.  This has a NROWS component specifying the
         number of rows, and a COLUMNS structure containing a series of
         further structures, each of which takes its name from the label
         of the corresponding column in the FITS table.  If there is no
         label for the $n$th column, the structure is called COLUMN$n$.
         These COLUMN structures contain a column of table data values in
         component DATA, preserving the original data type; and optional
         UNITS and COMMENT components which specify the column's units and
         the meaning of the column.  Thus for example, for the third
         sub-file of NDF called ABC, the data for column called RA would be
         located in ABC.MORE.FITS\_EXT\_3.COLUMNS.RA.DATA.
         \sstitem
         A random-group FITS file creates an NDF for each group.  As
         they are related observations the series of NDFs are stored in a
         single HDS container file whose name is still given by parameter
         OUT.  Each group NDF has component name FITS\_G\textit{n}, where 
         \textit{n} is the group number.

         Each group NDF contains the full header in the FITS extension,
         appended by the set of group parameters.  The group parameters
         are evaluated using their scales and offsets, and made to look
         like FITS cards.  The keywords of these FITS cards are derived
         from the values of PTYPE\textit{m} in the main header, where 
         \textit{m} is the number of the group parameter.

            \sstitem
            FITS ASCII and binary tables become NDF extensions, however,
            the original structure path and data type are restored using
            the values of the EXTNAME and EXTTYPE keywords respectively.
            An extension may be an array of structures, the shape being stored
            in the EXTSHAPE keyword.  The shapes of multi-dimensional arrays
            within the extensions are also restored.
            \sstitem
            HISTORY cards in a special format created by NDF2FITS are
            converted back into NDF history records.  This will only work
            provided the HISTORY headers have not been tampered.  Such
            headers are not transferred to the FITS airlock, when
            PROFITS=\texttt{TRUE}.

            The conversion is restricted to a 2dF archive FITS file
            created by task NDF2FITS.  FITS2NDF restores the original NDF.
            It creates the 2dF FIBRES extension and its constituent
            structures, and NDF\_CLASS extension.  In addition the variance,
            axes, and HISTORY records are converted.
            \sstitem
            The HISTORY propagation assumes that the FITS HISTORY headers
            have not been tampered.

            Details of the conversion are:
            \ssthitemlist{

               The primary data array becomes the NDF's data array.  Any
               NaN values present become \xref{bad}{sun95}{se_badmasking} values in the NDF.

               The keywords CRVAL\textit{n}, CDELT\textit{n}, CRPIX\textit{n},
               CTYPE\textit{n}, CUNIT\textit{n} are
               used to create the NDF axis centres, labels, and units.
               \sstitem
               The OBJECT, LABEL, BUNIT keywords define the NDF's title,
               label, and units components respectively, if they are defined.
               \sstitem
               HISTORY cards in a special format created by NDF2FITS are
               converted back into NDF history records.
               \sstitem
               The NDF variance is derived from the data array of an
               IMAGE extension (usually the first), if present, provided the
               IMAGE extension headers have an HDUCLAS2 keyword whose value
               is either \texttt{'VARIANCE'} or \texttt{'ERROR'}.
               \sstitem
               The NDF\_CLASS extension within the NDF is filled using the
               a FITS binary-table extension whose EXTNAME keyword's value is
               NDF\_CLASS.  Note: no error is reported if this extension does
               not exist within the FITS file.
               \sstitem
               The FIBRES extension is created from another FITS binary table
               whose EXTNAME keyword's value is FIBRES.  The OBJECT
               substructure's component names, data types, and values are
               taken from the binary-table columns themselves, and the
               components of the FIELD substructure are extracted from
               recognised keywords in the binary-table's header.  Note:
               no error is reported if this extension does not exist within
               the FITS file.
               \sstitem
               A FITS extension in the NDF may be written to store the
               primary data unit's headers when parameter PROFITS is
               \texttt{TRUE}.  This FITS airlock will not contain any
               NDF-style HISTORY records.

         \sstitem
         The title of the IRAF image (object i\_title in the \texttt{".imh"}
         header file) becomes the NDF title.  Likewise headers OBJECT and
         BUNIT become the NDF label and units respectively.

         \sstitem
         The pixel origin is set if any LBOUND\textit{n} headers are present.

         \sstitem
         Lines from the IRAF image header file may be transferred to
         the FITS extension of the NDF, when PROFITS=\texttt{TRUE}.  Any
         compulsory FITS keywords that are missing are added.  Certain
         other keywords are not propagated.  These are the IRAF ``Mini
         World Co-ordinate System'' (MWCS) keywords WCSDIM, DC\_FLAG,
         WAT\textit{d}\_\textit{nnn} (\textit{d} is dimension, \textit{nnn}
         is the line number).
         Certain NDF-style HISTORY lines in the header are also
         be ignored when PROHIS=\texttt{TRUE} (see two notes below).

         \sstitem
         When PROFITS=\texttt{TRUE}, lines from the HISTORY section of the IRAF
         image are also extracted and added to the NDF's FITS extension as
         FITS HISTORY lines.  Two extra HISTORY lines are added to record
         the original name of the image and the date of the format
         conversion.

         When PROHIS=\texttt{TRUE}, any HISTORY lines in the IRAF headers, which
         originated from an NDF2IRAF conversion of NDF HISTORY records.

         co-ordinates are transferred to the NDF AXIS centres.  Any
         spec2 \dots spec\textit{n} co-ordinates, present when the data array 
         is not one-dimensional or multiple fits have been stored, are ignored.
         The weights for multiple fits are thus also ignored.  The data
         type of the axis centres is \_REAL or \_DOUBLE depending on the
         number of significant digits in the co-ordinates or coefficients.

         The axis labels and units are also propagated, where present, to
         the NDF AXIS structure.  In the FITS system, these are derived
         from the CTYPE\textit{n} and CUNIT\textit{n} keywords.  
         In the MWCS, these components originate in the label and units 
         parameters.

         The redshift correction, when present, is applied to the MCWS
         axis co-ordinates.

               to the keyword NAXIS, and the actual dimensions to NAXIS1,

            \sstitem
               If the NDF contains any linear axis structures the
               information necessary to generate these structures is
               written to the FITS-like headers. For example, if a linear
               AXIS(1) structure exists in the input NDF the value of the
               first data point is stored with the keyword CRVAL1,
               and the incremental value between successive axis data is
               stored in keyword CDELT1.  By definition the reference pixel is
               1.0 and is stored in keyword CRPIX1.  If there is an axis label
               it is written to keyword CTYPE1, and axis unit is written to CUNIT1.
               (Similarly for AXIS(2) structures {\it etc.}) FITS does not have
               a standard method of storing axis widths and variances, so these
               NDF components will not be propagated to the header.
               Non-linear axis data arrays cannot be represented by CRVAL{\em{n}}
               and CDELT{\em{n}}, and must be ignored.

               \begin{itemize}
               \item BITPIX is derived from the type of the NDF data array,

               contained no linear axis structures.
               \item The standard order of the FITS keywords is preserved,
               thus BITPIX, NAXIS and AXIS{\em{n}} appear immediately after the
               first card image, which should be SIMPLE.
               \item BSCALE and BZERO in a FITS extension are copied when
               BITPIX is positive, {\it i.e.}\ the array is not floating-point.

   \sstnotes{
      The rules for the conversion are as follows:
      \ssthitemlist{

         \sstitem
         The NDF main data array becomes the primary data array of the
         FITS file if it is in value of parameter COMP, otherwise the first
         array defined by parameter COMP will become the primary data
         array.  A conversion from floating point to integer or to a
         shorter integer type will cause the output array to be scaled and
         offset, the values being recorded in keywords BSCALE and BZERO.
         There is an offset (keyword BZERO) applied to signed byte and
         unsigned word types to make them unsigned-byte and signed-word
         values respectively in the FITS array (this is because FITS does
         not support these data types).

         \sstitem
         The FITS keyword BLANK records the \xref{bad values}{sun95}{se_badmasking}
         for integer output types.  Bad values in floating-point output arrays are
         denoted by IEEE not-a-number values.

         \sstitem
         The NDF's quality and variance arrays appear in individual
         FITS IMAGE extensions immediately following the primary header
         and data unit, unless that component already appears as the
         primary data array.  The quality array will always be written as
         an unsigned-byte array in the FITS file, regardless of the value
         of the parameter BITPIX.

         \sstitem
         Here are details of the processing of standard items from the
         NDF into the FITS header, listed by FITS keyword.
         \ssthitemlist{

            \sstitem
            SIMPLE, EXTEND, PCOUNT, GCOUNT --- all take their default
              values.

            \sstitem
            BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXISn --- are derived directly from the NDF
              data array;

            \sstitem
            CRVAL\textit{n}, CDELT\textit{n}, CRPIX\textit{n}, CTYPE\textit{n},
            CUNIT\textit{n} --- are derived
              from the NDF WCS component if possible (see 
              \htmlref{\texttt{"}World Co-ordinate Systems\texttt{"}}
                 {world_coordinate_systems}).
              If this is not possible, and if PROFITS is \texttt{TRUE}, then
              they are copied from the NDF FITS extension.

            \sstitem
            OBJECT, LABEL, BUNIT --- the values held in the NDF's title,
              label, and units components respectively are used if
              they are defined; otherwise any values found in the FITS
              extension are used (provided parameter PROFITS is \texttt{TRUE}).

            \sstitem
            DATE --- is created automatically.

            \sstitem
            ORIGIN --- inherits any existing ORIGIN card in the NDF FITS
              extension, unless you supply a value through parameter
              ORIGIN other than the default \texttt{"Starlink Project, U.K."}

            \sstitem
            EXTNAME --- is the array-component name when the EXTNAME
              appears in the primary header or an IMAGE extension.  In a
              binary-table derived from an NDF extension, EXTNAME is the
              path of the extension within the NDF, the path separator
              being the usual dot.  The path includes the indices to
              elements of any array structures present; the indices are in
              a comma-separated list within parentheses.

            \sstitem
            EXTLEVEL --- is the level in the hierarchical structure of the
              extensions.  Thus a top-level extension has value 1,
              sub-components of this extension have value 2 and so on.

            \sstitem
            EXTTYPE --- is the data type of the NDF extension used to
              create a binary table.

            \sstitem
            EXTSHAPE --- is the shape of the NDF extension used to
            create a binary table.  It is a comma-separated list of the
            dimensions, and is 0 when the extension is not an array.

            \sstitem
            HDUCLAS1, HDUCLAS{\em{n}} --- \texttt{"NDF"} and the
              array-component name respectively.

            \sstitem
            LBOUND{\textit{n}} --- is the pixel origin for the 
              $\textit{n}^{\rm th}$ dimension
              when any of the pixel origins is not equal to 1.  (This is not a
              standard FITS keyword.)

            \sstitem
            XTENSION, BSCALE, BZERO, BLANK and END --- are not propagated
              from the NDF's FITS extension.  XTENSION will be set for
              any extension.  BSCALE and BZERO will be defined based on
              the chosen output data type in comparison with the NDF
              array's type, but cards with values 1.0 and 0.0 respectively
              are written to reserve places in the header section.  These
              `reservation' cards are for efficiency and they can always
              be deleted later.  BLANK is set to the Starlink standard 
              \xref{bad value}{sun95}{se_badmasking} corresponding to the type
              specified by BITPIX, but only for integer types and not for the
              quality array.  It appears regardless of whether or not there are
              bad values actually present in the array; this is for the same
              efficiency reasons as before.  The END card terminates the FITS header.

            \sstitem
            HISTORY --- HISTORY headers are propagated from the FITS
              extension when PROFITS is \texttt{TRUE}, and from the NDF
              history component when PROHIS is \texttt{TRUE}.

         }

         \sstitem
         Extension information may be transferred to the FITS file when
         PROEXTS is \texttt{TRUE}.
         The whole hierarchy of extensions is propagated
         in order.  This includes substructures, and arrays of extensions
         and substructures.  However, at present, any extension structure
         containing only substructures is not propagated itself (as
         zero-column tables are not permitted), although its
         substructures may be converted.
 
         Each extension or substructure creates a one-row binary table,
         where the columns of the table correspond to the primitive
         (non-structure) components.  The name of each column is the
         component name.  The column order is the same as the component
         order.  The shapes of multi-dimensional arrays are recorded using
         the TDIM\textit{n} keyword, where \textit{n} is the column number.
         The HEASARCH convention for specifying the width of character arrays 
         (keyword TFORM\textit{n}='\textit{r}A\textit{w}', where \textit{r} is
         the total number of characters in the column and \textit{w} is the 
         width of an element) is used.  The EXTNAME,
         EXTTYPE, EXTSHAPE and EXTLEVEL keywords (see above) are written
         to the binary-table header.

      }
      There are additional rules if a multi-NDF container file is being
      converted (see parameter CONTAINER).  This excludes the case where
      there are but two NDFs---one data and the other just 
      headers---that have already been merged (see parameter MERGE):
      \ssthitemlist{

         \sstitem
            For multiple NDFs a header-only HDU may be created followed 
            by an IMAGE extension containing the data array (or 
            whichever other array is first specified by COMP).
         \sstitem
            BITPIX for the header HDU is set to an arbitrary 8.
         \sstitem
            Additional keywords are written for each IMAGE extension.
         \ssthitemlist{
            \sstitem
             HDSNAME --- is the NDF name for a component NDF in a multi-NDF
               container file, for example \texttt{I2}.
             \sstitem
             HDSTYPE --- is set to \texttt{NDF} for a component NDF in a 
               multi-NDF container file.

   }{
      Any co-ordinate system information stored in the WCS component of the
      NDF is written to the FITS header using one of the following encoding
      systems (the encodings used are determined by parameters ENCODING and 
      NATIVE):
      \ssthitemlist{

         \sstitem 
         \texttt{"FITS-IRAF"} --- This uses keywords CRVAL\textit{i},
         CRPIX\textit{i}, and CD\textit{i\_j}, and is the
         system commonly used by IRAF. It is described in the document
         \textit{World Coordinate Systems Representations Within the FITS
         Format}\ by by R.J. Hanisch and D.G. Wells, 1988, available by ftp from
         fits.cv.nrao.edu \texttt{/fits/documents/wcs/wcs88.ps.Z}.


         \sstitem
         \texttt{"FITS-WCS"} --- This is the proposed FITS standard WCS
         encoding scheme described in the paper 
         \htmladdnormallink{\textit{Representation of celestial coordinates in FITS}}
         {http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.html}\\ \latex{
         (\texttt{http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.html})}.
         It is very similar to \texttt{"FITS-IRAF"} but supports a wider 
         range of projections and co-ordinate systems.  Once the standard
         has been agreed, this encoding should be understood by any 
         FITS-WCS compliant software and it is likely to be
         adopted widely for FITS data in future. 

         \sstitem
         \texttt{"FITS-PC"} --- This uses keywords CRVAL\textit{i},
         CDELT\textit{i}, CRPIX\textit{i}, PC\textit{iiijjj}, 
         \textit{etc}, as described in a previous (now superseded) draft of
         the above FITS world co-ordinate system paper by E.W.Greisen and 
         M.Calabretta.

         \sstitem
         \texttt{"FITS-AIPS"} --- This uses conventions described in the
         document "\textit{Non-linear Coordinate Systems in AIPS}" by
         Eric W. Greisen (revised 9th September, 1994), available by ftp
         from fits.cv.nrao.edu \texttt{/fits/documents/wcs/aips27.ps.Z.}
         It is currently employed by the AIPS data-analysis facility
         (amongst others), so its use
         will facilitate data exchange with AIPS. This encoding uses
         CROTA\textit{i} and CDELT\textit{i} keywords to describe axis
         rotation and scaling.

         \sstitem 
         \texttt{"FITS-AIPS++"} --- This is an extension to FITS-AIPS which 
         allows the use of a wider range of celestial as used by the AIPS++ 
         project.

         \sstitem
         \texttt{"DSS"} --- This is the system used by the Digital Sky Survey, and
         uses keywords AMDX\textit{n}, AMDY\textit{n}, PLTRAH, etc.

         \sstitem
         \texttt{"NATIVE"} --- This is the native system used by the AST library (see
         SUN/210) and provides a loss-free method for transferring WCS
         information between AST-based applications.  It allows more
         complicated WCS information to be stored and retrieved than any of 
         the other encodings.
      }

      Values for FITS keywords generated by the above encodings will
      always be used in preference to any corresponding keywords found in
      the FITS extension (even if PROFITS is \texttt{TRUE}).
      If this is not what
      is required, the WCS component of the NDF should be erased using
      the \KAPPA\ command \xref{ERASE}{sun95}{ERASE} before running NDF2FITS. Note, if PROFITS
      is \texttt{TRUE}, then any WCS-related keywords in the FITS extension
      which are not replaced by keywords derived from the WCS component may
      appear in the output FITS file. If this causes a problem, then
      PROFITS should be set to \texttt{FALSE} or the offending keywords removed
      using \KAPPA\ 
      \xref{FITSEDIT}{sun95}{FITSEDIT}

      In the general case, NDF extensions (excluding the FITS extension)
      may be converted to one-row binary tables in the FITS file when
      parameter PROEXTS is \texttt{TRUE}.  This preserves the information,
      but it may not be accessible to the recipient's FITS reader.  Therefore,
      in some cases it is desirable to understand the meanings of
      certain NDF extensions, and create standard FITS products for
      compatibility.

      At present only one product is supported, but others may be added
      as required.

         Standard processing is used except for the 2dF FIBRES extension
         and its constituent structures.  The NDF may be restored from the
         created FITS file using FITS2NDF.  The FIBRES extension converts
         to the second binary table in the FITS file (the NDF\_CLASS
         extension appears in the first).

         To propagate the OBJECT substructure, NDF2FITS creates a binary
         table of constant width (224 bytes) with one row per fibre.  The
         total number of rows is obtained from component NUM\_FIBRES.  If a
         possible OBJECT component is missing from the NDF, a null column
         is written for that component.  The columns inherit the data
         types of the OBJECT structure's components.  Column meanings and
         units are assigned based upon information in the reference given
         below.

         The FIELD structure components are converted into additional
         keywords of the same name in the binary-table header, with the
         exception that components with names longer than eight characters
         have abbreviated keywords: UNALLOC\textit{xxx} becomes
         UNAL-\textit{xxx} (\textit{xxx}=OBJ,
         GUI, or SKY), CONFIGMJD becomes CONFMJD, and \textit{x}SWITCHOFF
         becomes \textit{x}SWTCHOF (\textit{x}=X or Y).  If any FIELD 
         component is missing it is ignored.

         Keywords for the extension level, name, and type appear in the
         binary-table header.

      This application converts an \NDFref\ to a Tag Image File Format (\TIFFref).
      One- or two-dimensional arrays can be handled and various methods
      of scaling the data are provided.

      The routine first finds the brightest and darkest pixel values
      required by the particular scaling method in use. It then uses
      these to determine suitable scaling factors and converts the image
      into an 8-bit representation which is then output to a simple
      greyscale TIFF-6.0 file.

      If the `high' scaling value is less than the `low' value, the output
      image will be a negative. \xref{Bad values}{sun95}{se_badmasking} are
      set to 0 for positives and 255 for negatives.

         \ssthitemlist{

            \sstitem
               The number of dimensions of the data array is written
               to the keyword NAXIS, and the actual dimensions to NAXIS1,
               NAXIS2 {\it etc.} as appropriate.

            \sstitem
               If the NDF contains any linear axis structures the
               information necessary to generate these structures is
               written to the FITS-like headers. For example, if a linear
               AXIS(1) structure exists in the input NDF the value of the
               first data point is stored with the keyword CRVAL1,
               and the incremental value between successive axis data is
               stored in keyword CDELT1.  By definition the reference pixel is
               1.0 and is stored in keyword CRPIX1.  If there is an axis label
               it is written to keyword CTYPE1, and axis unit is written to CUNIT1.
               (Similarly for AXIS(2) structures {\it etc.}) FITS does not have
               a standard method of storing axis widths and variances, so these
               NDF components will not be propagated to the header.
               Non-linear axis data arrays cannot be represented by CRVAL{\em{n}}
               and CDELT{\em{n}}, and must be ignored.

            \sstitem
               If the input NDF contains TITLE, LABEL or UNITS components
               these are stored with the keywords TITLE, LABEL or BUNIT
               respectively.

            \sstitem
               If the input NDF contains a FITS extension, the FITS items
               may be written to the FITS-like header, with the following
               exceptions:
               \begin{itemize}
               \item BITPIX is derived from the type of the NDF data array,
               and so it is not copied from the NDF FITS extension.
               \item NAXIS, and NAXIS{\em{n}} are derived from the dimensions of the
               NDF data array as described above, so these items are not
               copied from the NDF FITS extension.
               \item The TITLE, LABEL, and BUNIT descriptors are only copied
               if no TITLE, LABEL, and UNITS NDF components respectively
               have already been copied into these headers.
               \item The CDELT{\em{n}}, CRVAL{\em{n}}, CTYPE{\em{n}},
               CUNIT{\em{n}}, and CRTYPE{\em{n}} descriptors
               in the FITS extension are only copied if the input NDF
               contained no linear axis structures.
               \item The standard order of the FITS keywords is preserved,
               thus BITPIX, NAXIS and NAXIS{\em{n}} appear immediately after the
               first card image, which should be SIMPLE.
               \item BSCALE and BZERO in a FITS extension are copied when
               BITPIX is positive, {\it i.e.} the array is not floating-point.
               \end{itemize}

            \sstitem
               An extra header record with keyword UNSIGNED and logical
               value T is added when the array data type is one of the \HDSref\
               unsigned integer types.  This is done because standard FITS
               does not support unsigned integers, and allows (in conjunction
               with BITPIX) applications reading the unformatted file to
               determine the data type of the array.

      order to save observing time.  For example, for a grid centred on
      a typical, roughly circular, object spectra may be omitted for the
      positions at the corners of the grid.  SPECX map files are standard
      Starlink NDF HDS structures.  The principal array of the NDF is a
      two-dimensional array of the grid positions.  The value of each
      element is either a pointer to the spectrum observed there (in
      practice the number of the spectrum in the array where they are
      stored) or a value indicating that a spectrum was not observed at
      this point.  In effect the SPECX map structure is an implementation
      of a sparse array.

      SPECX2NDF expands a SPECX map file into a simple three-dimensional
      data cube, again formatted as a standard NDF, in which the first
      and second pixel axes corresponds to the spatial axes and the third
      axes correspond to the spectral axis.  The advantage of
      this approach is that the converted file can be examined with
      standard applications, such as those in \KAPPA\ (see \xref{SUN/95}{sun95}{}) and
      easily imported into visualisation packages, such as Data Explorer
      (DX, see \xref{SUN/203}{sun203}{} and \xref{SC/2}{sc2}{}).  When the 
      output data cube is created
      the columns corresponding to the positions on the sky grid where
      spectra were not observed are filled with \xref{`bad'
      values}{sun95}{se_masking} (sometimes
      called `magic' or `null' values), to indicate that valid data are
      not available at these positions.  The \xref{standard Starlink
      bad value}{sun95}{se_badmasking}
      is used.  Because of the presence of these bad values the expanded
      cube is usually larger than the original map file.

      The created NDF cube has a WCS component in which axes 1 and 2 are
      RA and DEC, and axis 3 is frequency in units of GHz. The nature of
      these axes can be changed if necessary by subsequent use of the
      \xref{WCSATTRIB}{sun95}{WCSATTRIB} application within the \KAPPA\ package.
      For compatibility
      with older applications, AXIS structures are also added to the output
      cube. Axes 1 and 2 are offsets from the central position of the map,
      with units of seconds of arc, and axis 3 is frequency offset in GHz
      relative to the central frequency.  The pixel origin is placed at the
      source position on axes 1 and 2, and the central frequency on axis 3.

      SPECX2NDF reads map files in version 4.2 or later of the SPECX data 
      format. If it is given a map file in an earlier version of the
      data format it will terminate with an error message.  Note,
      however, that SPECX itself can read map files in earlier versions
      of the SPECX format and convert them to version 4.2.
   }
   \sstdiytopic{
      Schematic of the map grid   \label{SCHEMATICMAP}
   }{
      SPECX2NDF has an optional facility to write a crude schematic of
      the grid of points observed on the sky to an ASCII text file
      suitable for printing or viewing on a terminal screen.  This
      schematic can be useful in interpreting displays of the data cube.
      It shows the positions on the grid where spectra were observed.
      Each spectrum is numbered within the SPECX map structure and the
      first nine are shown using the digits one to nine.  The remaining
      spectra are shown using an asterisk (\texttt{"*"}).  You specify the name
      of the file to which the schematic is written.
      \html{The figure below}
      \latex{Figure~\ref{MAPSCHEMATIC}} shows an example of a schematic.
   }
   \sstdiytopic{
      Auxiliary information
   }{
      SPECX2NDF copies all the auxiliary information present in the
      original map file to the output data cube.  However, the arrays
      holding the original spectra are not copied in order to save
      disk space.
   }
   \sstdiytopic{
      Input and output spectra formats
   }{
      In addition to converting SPECX map files, this application can also
      convert HDS files which hold an array of one-dimensional NDF structures,
      each being a single spectrum extracted by SPECX.  Since arrays of NDFs
      are not easily accessed, this application extracts each NDF from the
      array and creates a new scalar NDF holding the same data within the
      output container file.  The name of the new NDF is \texttt{SPECTRUM\textit{n}} 
      where \textit{n} is its index within the original array of NDFs. 
      Each new scalar NDF is actually three-dimensional and has the format
      described above for an output cube (\textit{i.e.}\ axes 1 and 2 are RA and DEC,
      and axis 3 is frequency).  However, pixel axes 1 and 2 span only a
      single pixel (the size of this single spatial pixel is assumed to be
      half the size of the resolution of the JCMT at the central frequency).
      Inclusion of three-dimensional WCS information allows the individual
      spectra to be aligned on the sky (for instance using the \KAPPA\ 
      \xref{WCSALIGN}{sun95}{WCSALIGN} task).

            the unformatted-file array is written to the NDF array as
            selected by COMP.  When the NDF is being modified, the shape
            of the new component must match that of the NDF.

         \sstitem
            If the input file contains a FITS-like header, and a new
            NDF is created, {\it i.e.}\ COMP = \texttt{"Data"}, the header
            records are placed within the NDF's FITS extension.  This enables 
            more than one array (input file) to be used to form an NDF.  Note
            that the data array must be created first to make a valid NDF,
            and it's the FITS structure associated with that array that is
            wanted.  Indeed the application prevents you from doing
            otherwise.

         \sstitem
            The FITS-like header defines the properties of the NDF as
            follows:
            \begin{itemize}
            \item BITPIX defines the data type: 8 gives \_BYTE, 16 produces
            \_WORD, 32 makes \_INTEGER, $-$32 gives \_REAL, and $-$64 generates
            \_DOUBLE.  For the first two, if there is an extra header
            record with the keyword UNSIGNED and logical value T, these
            types become \_UBYTE and \_UWORD respectively.  UNSIGNED is
            non-standard, since unsigned integers would not follow in a
            proper FITS file.  However, here it is useful to enable
            unsigned types to be input into an NDF.  UNSIGNED may be
            created by this application's sister, NDF2UNF.  BITPIX is
            ignored for QUALITY data; type \_UBYTE is used.
            \item NAXIS, and NAXIS{\em{n}} define the shape of the NDF.
            \item The TITLE, LABEL, and BUNIT are copied to the NDF
            TITLE, LABEL, and UNITS NDF components respectively.
            \item The CDELT{\em{n}}, CRVAL{\em{n}}, CTYPE{\em{n}}, and CUNIT{\em{n}} keywords make
            linear axis structures within the NDF.  CUNIT{\em{n}} define the
            axis units, and the axis labels are assigned to CTYPE{\em{n}} If
            some are missing, pixel co-ordinates are used for those
            axes.
            \item BSCALE and BZERO in a FITS extension are ignored.
            \item BLANK is not used to indicate which input array values
            should be assigned to a \xref{standard bad
            value}{sun95}{se_badmasking}.
            \item END indicates the last header record unless it
            terminates a dummy header, and the actual data is in an
            extension.
            \end{itemize}

         \sstitem
            Other data item such as HISTORY, data ORIGIN, and axis
            widths are not supported, because the unformatted file has a
            simple structure to enable a diverse set of input files to be
            converted to NDFs, and to limitations of the standard FITS
            header.

\IDLref\
function 
\htmlref{READ\_NDF}{READ_NDF}
is available to convert a component of an NDF to an IDL array, and IDL 
procedure 
\htmlref{WRITE\_NDF}{WRITE_NDF}
will create an NDF component from an IDL array. So, for example:
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
IDL> tv,read_ndf('comwest')
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
will display the data array of the NDF, \texttt{comwest.sdf}, using the IDL
command, \texttt{TV}, and:
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
IDL> write_ndf,field,'stars'
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
will create an NDF, \texttt{stars.sdf}, of a suitable type and size, and write
the IDL array, \texttt{field}, to its \texttt{DATA\_ARRAY} component.
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
IDL> write_ndf,q,'stars','QUALITY'
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
will write the IDL array, \texttt{q}, to the \texttt{QUALITY} component of an 
existing NDF, \texttt{stars.sdf}.

Both READ\_NDF and WRITE\_NDF can take special action on \xref{bad

IDL>tv,comwest.data_array
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
will display the same image as the READ\_NDF example above, but the other
components of the NDF are also available in the IDL structure,
\texttt{comwest}, so that:
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
IDL> idl2hds,comwest,'newcomwest'
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
will create a duplicate of \texttt{comwest.sdf} in \texttt{newcomwest.sdf}.
Exact duplication of the type and structure is not always possible -- see the 
routine descriptions for details.

When \CONVERT\ is installed, the converter procedures and routines are
placed in \texttt{\$CONVERT\_DIR} so, to make them available to IDL,
that directory must be added to the IDL search paths, \texttt{IDL\_PATH} and
\texttt{IDL\_DLM\_PATH}. This will be done if the environment variable 
IDL\_PATH has been set (usually by `sourcing' the 
\texttt{idl\_setup} script) when you start the \CONVERT\ package by typing:
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
% convert
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
Note that \texttt{convert} must be run \emph{after} sourcing the 
\texttt{idl\_setup} script.

\emph{Note also that having started \CONVERT\, 
\xref{the NDF library}{sun33}{abstract}\latex{ (see SUN/33)},
which is ultimately used by READ\_NDF and WRITE\_NDF, will
allow them (but not HDS2IDL and IDL2HDS) to do 
\htmlref{on-the-fly conversion}{sect_auto}\latex{ (see Section \ref{sect_auto})}
of any files given as parameters. This opens up the possibility of using almost 
any data format with IDL.}

As an example:
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
IDL> tv,read_ndf('moon.imh')
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
will display the \IRAFref\ file, \texttt{moon.imh}.

\subsection{Other Methods}
\subsubsection{A simple route (but rather slow)}
The simplest route to use when generating data for IDL from NDFs is
to create an ASCII copy of the NDF you are interested in
using the \CONVERT\ package application 
\htmlref{NDF2ASCII}{NDF2ASCII} and then read 
the resulting file with IDL. The steps taken might be something like:

\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
% ndf2ascii in=imagein out=fileout  
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
This will create a file, \texttt{fileout}, containing the data component 
of the NDF called \texttt{imagein}. If you want to store the variance or 
quality components you would use \texttt{comp=v} or \texttt{comp=q} respectively
as additional parameters.

You can then employ a simple IDL batch file such as:
\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
; Create IMAGE an 339x244 single precision floating point array.
IMAGE=FLTARR(339,244)

; Open the existing NDF2ASCII file "fileout" for read only access. 
OPENR, UNIT, 'fileout', /GET_LUN
  
; Read formatted input from the specified file unit and 
; place in the variable "IMAGE".
READF, UNIT, IMAGE
 
; Closes the file unit used.
CLOSE, UNIT

; Display the image after suitable scaling. 
TVSCL, IMAGE
\end{verbatim} \end{quote} 
The above example assumes image dimensions of 339$\times$244 pixels. 
If you are in any doubt as to the dimensions of your image you can
determine them using the \KAPPA\ application 
\xref{NDFTRACE}{sun95}{NDFTRACE}. 

One advantage of this route is that the ASCII data can instead be read
directly into byte, integer or double-precision arrays/structures by 
simply substituting \texttt{INTARR}, \texttt{DBLARR} or \texttt{BYTARR} for 
\texttt{FLTARR}. Clearly, it should be remembered that attempting to represent 
floating-point values 
within a byte array will not work properly, whereas a double-precision 
array will accommodate double-precision, floating-point, integer or byte 
values (though somewhat inefficiently in terms of memory consumption).


\subsubsection{A faster route (but a little more complicated)}
However, the NDF2ASCII routine is not fast and makes this route awkward
if time is important. Consequently, you may want to use
\htmlref{NDF2UNF}{NDF2UNF} to create an F77 unformatted sequential file thus:

\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
% ndf2unf in=imagein out=fileout noperec=339
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
Where the \texttt{noperec} number should be the size of the first axis of
the image.  

You can then read the created file using an IDL batch file similar to:

\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
; Supply the name of the image and its dimensions.
FNAME='fileout'
SD1=339
SD2=244
  
; Set up the main array and temporary array
; use NOZERO option to avoid initialisation 
IMAGE=INTARR(SD1,SD2,/NOZERO)
TEMP= INTARR(SD1,    /NOZERO)
 
; Display what is going on.
PRINT, "Converting file: ", FNAME
 
; Open the file generated by NDF2UNF for read access only.
OPENR, UNIT, fname, /GET_LUN, /F77_UNFORMATTED
 
; Read the image one record at a time.
FOR I=0,SD2-1  DO BEGIN  READU, UNIT, TEMP & $
  ; Transfer each line into the main image array.
  FOR J=0,SD1-1 DO BEGIN IMAGE(J,I)=TEMP(J) & $ 
ENDFOR & ENDFOR 
 
; Close the opened file unit.
CLOSE, 1
 
; Scale the image for display.
IMAGE=CONGRID(IMAGE,SD1,SD2,/INTERP)
WINDOW, 0,XSIZE=SD1,YSIZE=SD2
 
; Display the image.
TVSCL, IMAGE
\end{verbatim} \end{quote} 

The image is then contained in the integer array \texttt{IMAGE} and may be 
manipulated by IDL. This would allow such operations as storing it as 
a UNIX unformatted file where the image might subsequently be read in 
from disc in one go.

It should be remembered that the data type of the F77 unformatted
file created by NDF2UNF may differ depending on the type of data stored 
in the original NDF. If this is the case you might need to change the 
type definition of the arrays \texttt{image} and \texttt{temp} to reflect this. 
The data type used within each component of an NDF may be determined using 
\xref{NDFTRACE}{sun95}{NDFTRACE}. 


\subsubsection{Using the IDL Astronomy Users' Library}

If this all seems a bit tedious, then those of you with with the IDL 
Astronomy Users' Library installed on your machines might choose to 
take advantage of its FITS conversion procedures to make life easier 
still. Users wishing to obtain a copy of the library can find it at 
\htmladdnormallink{\texttt{\IDLAULURL}}{\IDLAULURL}.

The library contains IDL procedures from a number of sources that allow FITS 
format files to be read into IDL data structures. The routine chosen for the
example below was FXREAD which may be found in the \texttt{/pro/bintable} 
sub-directory. It is part of a comprehensive suite of FITS conversion programs
that seems particularly easy to use.

So if you first convert your NDF into a FITS file using
\htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS} like this:

\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
% ndf2fits in=m42 out=m42.fit comp=d
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
you can then use the following code from within IDL to place the image
into an IDL structure and display it. 

\begin{quote} \begin{verbatim}
; Read the FITS file 
fxread, 'm42.fit', DATA, HEADER
 
; Determine the size of the image
SIZEX=fxpar(header, 'NAXIS1')
SIZEY=fxpar(header, 'NAXIS2')
 
; Find the data type being read
DTYPE=fxpar(header, 'BITPIX')
 
; Scale the image for display
IMAGE=congrid(DATA,SIZEX,SIZEY,/INTERP)
window, 0,xsize=SIZEX,ysize=SIZEY
 
; Display the image
TVSCL, IMAGE
\end{verbatim} \end{quote}
As can be seen above, various values contained within the FITS header 
of the original can be obtained using the FXPAR procedure. 

You should bear in mind that a number of other procedures (such as 
IEEE\_TO\_HOST and GET\_DATE) from the Astronomy Users' Library 
are also needed by IDL when compiling this code. Consequently it is 
essential that the whole library should be obtained from the archive.

\section[{\small IRAF} Versions]{\label{iraf_versions}{\normalsize IRAF} Versions}
The \CONVERT\ utilities 
\htmlref{NDF2IRAF}{NDF2IRAF}
and
\htmlref{IRAF2NDF}{IRAF2NDF}
are built using copies of relevant \IRAF\ libraries (which are included in
the \CONVERT\ release) so they exhibit the same behaviour as the \IRAF\ version
from which the libraries were extracted.
(There are also some \IRAF\ dependencies in the so-called SPP 
routines of \CONVERT\ -- these originate written in the \IRAF\ SPP language and 
include header files defining the layout of the \IRAF\ image.)
The versions of IRAF2NDF and NDF2IRAF which you use must therefore be
compatible with the version of \IRAF\ which you are using.

A new version of the \IRAFref\ image format was developed for 
\IRAF\ Version 2.11 onwards.
\IRAF\ Version 2.11 onwards will read either the old or new image formats but
will  produce the new format by default. (It can be made to produce old-format
images by setting environment variable \texttt{oifversion=1}.)

\CONVERT\ contains \IRAF\ V2.11 compatible versions of the SPP 
routines and the \IRAF\ libraries.
If you are still running \IRAF\ V2.10, set environment variable 
\texttt{oifversion=1} before running NDF2IRAF. (This includes when running 
Starlink programs from \IRAF\ cl if an output image is produced by 
`on-the-fly' conversion.)

Details of which IRAF version libraries are used in \CONVERT\ will be given in
the release notes.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.2}
\subsection{New Applications}
\begin{description}
\item[\htmlref{READ\_NDF}{READ_NDF}] An IDL function to read an NDF component
into an IDL array.
\item[\htmlref{WRITE\_NDF}{WRITE_NDF}] An IDL procedure to write an IDL array to
an NDF component.
\end{description}
The use of these converters for IDL is described in
\latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{app_idl}}{\htmlref{Handling NDFs in \IDLref}{app_idl}}

\subsection{Changed applications}
\begin{description}
\item[\htmlref{NDF2TIFF}{NDF2TIFF}] Various alternative methods of scaling the
NDF data are provided.
\item[\htmlref{NDF2GIF}{NDF2GIF}] Various alternative methods of scaling the
NDF data are provided (the scaling is performed by 
\htmlref{NDF2TIFF}{NDF2TIFF}).
\item[\htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS}] Now has an additional parameter, ENCODING,
to control the way WCS information is encoded within the FITS header.
\item[\htmlref{NDF2IRAF}{NDF2IRAF}
and
\htmlref{IRAF2NDF}{IRAF2NDF}]
These are re-built using libraries from \IRAFref\ release V2.11.1.
\end{description}


\subsection{Documentation}
This document and \CONVERT\ help has been modified to reflect these changes.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.2-4}
  
All the converters which are ADAM tasks have been combined into a monolith
to save disk space.

The FITS converters now use the CFITSIO library.

\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF}
 will now report an error but continue to create the output NDF 
if an error occurs in creating history records.  It will also display 
warnings if it finds projections which include unsupported IRAF extensions.

A problem causing error "!! FTPSCL: Error defining the scale and offset."
when running 
\htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS}
has been corrected.

\IRAFref\ release V2.11.3 libraries are used in this release for building
\htmlref{NDF2IRAF}{NDF2IRAF}
and
\htmlref{IRAF2NDF}{IRAF2NDF}.

This document has been updated to include this section and a copyright 
statement. Some bugs in the HTML version header have been corrected.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.3-2}
Two new converters, 
\htmlref{HDS2IDL}{HDS2IDL}
and
\htmlref{IDL2HDS}{IDL2HDS},
are provided for IDL users. They handle complete structures, unlike 
\htmlref{READ\_NDF}{READ_NDF}
and
\htmlref{WRITE\_NDF}{WRITE_NDF}
which only handle the main arrays of NDFs. 

\htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS}
and
\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF}
have been enhanced by the addition of FITS-AIPS and FITS-PC encodings. Also,
appropriate messages are  output if there are no valid input files.

\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF}
has also been enhanced to allow more flexibility over the handling of
multi-extension FITS files. Syntax such as \texttt{filename.fit[1]} or
\texttt{"filename.fit[extname=im2]"} can be used to specify a single FITS
extension to be converted, and additional parameters EXTABLE and CONTAINER
allow FITS extensions to be combined to produce a single NDF or a series of
components of a top-level HDS container file.

The scripts associated with the NDF on-the-fly conversion system have been
modified to allow a single extension from a multi-extension FITS file to be
specified.  This feature requires applications to have been built with NDF 
V1.5-6 or later.

Different numbers of axes in the  BaseFrames of the NDF and FitsChan FrameSets
are now allowed when creating the NDF's WCS component.

\htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS} now uses the 
\xref{NDG}{sun2}{}
library to allow conversion of NDFs stored as sub-components within an 
HDS container file (\textit{e.g.} scuba data, \textit{etc}).

\IRAFref\ release V2.11.3 libraries are used in this release for building
\htmlref{NDF2IRAF}{NDF2IRAF}
and
\htmlref{IRAF2NDF}{IRAF2NDF}.

This document has been updated to describe the new applications and
enhancements, and to include the
\htmlref{`{\small IRAF} Versions' section}{iraf_versions}.
Early release-note sections have been removed.
On installation, only a link to the installed \LaTeX\ document is now retained
in the source directory.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.3-5}
\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF}
now creates a component of type FITS\_HEADER, not NDF, in the container
file for multi-extension FITS files if the FITS HDU does not contain a data
array.

\htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS}
Corrects a problem with NDF2FITS if there is garbage beyond the END header
record in the NDF's FITS airlock, and stops a second ORIGIN header being
output (copied from the airlock) if the ORIGIN parameter has been used to
specify a non-default ORIGIN.

\htmlref{NDF2PGM}{NDF2PGM}
A bug which caused the image to be offset by three bytes has been fixed,

This document has been updated to include this section and to update the
description of the CONTAINER parameter of
\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF}.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.3-6}
\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improve error reporting if no WCS encoding can be used.

\item Don't handle WCS if NDIM less than or = 0.

\item Correct handling of NDF history records in the FITS header.
\end{itemize}

\section{Release Notes -- V1.4}
Added application \htmlref{MTFITS2NDF}{MTFITS2NDF} to convert FITS tapes to NDFs.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.4-1}
Updated the IDL converters to work with IDL 5.5. Fix a problem causing a crash
on Linux and document the fact that the Starlink IDL converters cannot be used
with the 64-bit Solaris version of IDL.

Corrected an error in the section of this document describing the easy
way to do IDL/NDF conversions.  \htmlref{WRITE\_NDF}{WRITE_NDF} was
described as if it were a function rather than a procedure.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.4-2}
Parameter WCSATTRS is added to \htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF}.
This enables users to modify the way WCS information is extracted from the
FITS headers. This can be useful when the headers do not conform to conventions. 

\section{Release Notes -- V1.4-3}
Fixed a problem in \htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS} caused by a mismatch of
conventions used in the TFORM\textit{n} and TDIM\textit{n} header cards for
multi-dimensional character arrays.  A corresponding fix was required for
\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF}.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.4-4}
Fixed a bug in \htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF} caused by a missing END card on a
merged header.
  
\section{Release Notes -- V1.5}

\htmlref{SPECX2NDF}{SPECX2NDF} has been revamped so that it now uses
the new AST \xref{SpecFrame functionality}{sun95}{se_wcsuse},
allowing translation between spectral frames without re-running
SPECX2NDF.  The SPECTRUM parameter (and associated parameters SOR,
DOPPLER) are no longer required since they can be changed after
conversion using \xref{WCSATTRIB}{sun95}{WCSATTRIB} application. {\em
Scripts using SPECX2NDF may need modification.} In addition to dealing
with map files SPECX2NDF has now been extended to deal with
\xref{SPECX}{sun17}{data_formats_in_and_data_migration_to_the_unix_version}
data files; each spectrum in the file is translated to an NDF spectrum
in the output HDS container file.

\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF} supports INES archive IUE spectra.

Improved propagation of existing world co-ordinate system (WCS)
headers in \htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS} partially from improvements to
the \xref{AST subroutine library}{sun210}{}.  For example, long-slit
spectra with a three-dimensional WCS, but stored in a two-dimensional
image, retain their three-dimensional WCS headers.  Comments are
preserved where values have not changed significantly.

The references to the old VMS-only tasks have been removed from the
documentation because the residual VMS service no longer exists.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.5-4}
Added IRAF compatibility libs for Linux systems.  CONVERT should now
build on any ix86 Linux platform. 

\section{Release Notes -- V1.5-5}

Added FITS-AIPS$++$ and FITS-CLASS encodings to 
\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF} and \htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS}.

Clarified the description of \htmlref{UNF2NDF}{UNF2NDF} parameter TYPE
so that it is clear that the type given should also be of the input
data, not just the output NDF.

\htmlref{SPECX2NDF}{SPECX2NDF} now creates NDF files using the new
double-sideband SpecFrame.  See the AST documentation for more details
on double-sideband spectra.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.5-6}

FITSGZ is a new on-the-fly conversion format for GZIP-compressed FITS
files.  The recognised extensions are \texttt{fits.gz}, \texttt{fit.gz}, and
\texttt{fts.gz}.

FITS2NDF supports the new AAO Instruments (AAOMEGA and FMOS) that use
the 2dF data structures.
  
\section{Release Notes -- V1.5-7}

\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF} has a new TYPE group parameter to set the
data type of the NDF, overriding the value propagated from the FITS
BITPIX, or BSCALE and BZERO precision when FMTCNV is \texttt{TRUE}.

\htmlref{NDF2FITS}{NDF2FITS} now supports multi-NDFs HDS container files
through the new CONTAINER and MERGE parameters.

\section{Release Notes -- V1.5-8}

\htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF} parameter FMTCNV has a new allowed value
of \texttt{"Native"} requesting that there is no format conversion, and
the array of numbers stored in the FITS file are copied to a scaled array
within the NDF.  This preserves the data compression.  Parameter TYPE
continues to control the data type of the true unscaled values.
