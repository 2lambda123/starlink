      This application converts an NDF to an IRAF image in the old

         The name of the output IRAF image.  Two files are produced

         contains the data array, and {\tt ".IMH"} is the associated header
         file that may contain a copy of the NDF's FITS extension.
         The suggested default is the current value.

      The rules for the conversion are as follows:
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         The NDF data array is copied to the {\tt ".PIX"} file.

         \sstitem
         The NDF title is written to the header object {\tt i\_title} in
         the {\tt ".IMH"} header file.  There is a limit of twenty
         characters.

         \sstitem
         If there is a FITS extension in the NDF, then this is added to
         the `user area' of the IRAF header file.

         \sstitem
         A HISTORY record is added to the IRAF header file indicating
         that it originated in the named NDF and was converted by
         NDF2IRAF.

         \sstitem
         All other NDF components are ignored.
      }

   \sstdiytopic{
      Pitfalls
   }{
      The IMFORT routines refuse to overwrite an IRAF image if an image
      with the same name exists.  The application then aborts.

   }
   \sstimplementationstatus{
      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         Only handles two-dimensional NDFs, though a one-dimensional NDF
         is treated as an image with a second dimension equal to one.

         \sstitem
         Of the NDF's array components only the data array may be
         copied.

         \sstitem
         The IRAF image produced has type REAL independent of the
         type of the NDF's data array.  The pixel type of the image can be
         changed from within IRAF using the {\bf chpixtype} task in the
         {\bf images} package.
