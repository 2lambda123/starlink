   Converts a TIFF file into an NDF.

   \sstdescription{
      This Bourne-shell script converts a 256 grey-level or
      black-and-white dithered Tag Image File Format (TIFF) into an
      unsigned-byte NDF file.  It handles one- or two-dimensional
      images.  The script uses various PBMPLUS utilities to produce a
      FITS file, flipped top to bottom, and then
      \htmlref{FITS2NDF}{FITS2NDF} to produce
      the final NDF.  Error messages are converted into Starlink style
      (preceded by {\tt !}).

         The name of the TIFF file to be converted (without the {\tt .tif}
         extension, which is assumed).

         The name of the NDF to be generated (without the {\tt .sdf} extension).

      \sstexamplesubsection{
         tiff2ndf old new

         This converts the TIFF file {\tt old.tif} into an NDF called new

         tiff2ndf horse

   \sstnotes{
      The following points should be remembered:
      \sstitemlist{
         \sstitem
            This initial version of the script handles only greyscale
            or b/w dithered images.  You are responsible for conversion
            of your images to this format prior to use, including 
            the conversion of RGB values to brightness values.
         \sstitem
            Input image file names must have the extension {\tt .tif}.
         \sstitem
            The PBMPLUS utilities {\tt tifftopnm}, {\tt ppmtopgm} and
            {\tt pgmtofits} must be available on your PATH.
