      SUBROUTINE DST2NDF( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*      DST2NDF

*  Purpose:
*      Converts a Figaro (Version 2) DST file to an NDF.

*  Language:
*      Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*      ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*      CALL DST2NDF( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*      STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*         The global status.

*  Description:
*      This application converts a Figaro Version-2 DST file to a
*      Version-3 file, i.e. to an NDF.  The rules for converting the
*      various components of a DST are listed in the notes.  Since
*      both are hierarchical formats most files can be be converted with
*      little or no information lost.

*  Usage:
*      dst2ndf in out [form]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*      FORM = LITERAL (Read)
*         The storage form of the NDF's data and variance arrays.
*         FORM = "Simple" gives the simple form, where the array of data
*         and variance values is located in an ARRAY structure.  Here it
*         can have ancillary data like the origin.  This is the normal
*         form for an NDF.  FORM = "Primitive" offers compatibility with
*         earlier formats, such as IMAGE.  In the primitive form the
*         data and variance arrays are primitive components at the top
*         level of the NDF structure, and hence it cannot have
*         ancillary information. ["Simple"]
*      IN = Figaro file (Read)
*         The file name of the version 2 file.  A file extension must
*         not be given after the name, since ".dst" is appended by the
*         application.  The file name is limited to 80 characters.
*      OUT = NDF (Write)     
*         The file name of the output NDF file.  A file extension must
*         not be given after the name, since ".sdf" is appended by the
*         application.  Since the NDF_ library is not used, a section
*         definition may not be given following the name.  The file
*         name is limited to 80 characters.

*  Examples:
*     dst2ndf old new
*        This converts the Figaro file old.dst to the NDF called new
*        (in file new.sdf).  The NDF has the simple form.
*     dst2ndf horse horse p
*        This converts the Figaro file horse.dst to the NDF called
*        horse (in file HORSE.SDF).  The NDF has the primitive form.

*  Notes:
*     The rules for the conversion of the various components are as
*     follows:

*            .FITS.xxxx.yyyy ->   .MORE.FITS(n)  (into blank-keyword
*                                                 comment containing
*                                                 yyyy=value)

*            .xxxx           ->   .MORE.FIGARO.xxxx
*
*     -  Axis arrays with dimensionality greater than one are not
*     supported by the NDF.  Therefore, if the application encounters
*     such an axis array, it processes the array using the following
*     rules, rather than those given above.
*
*            .X.DATA         ->   .AXIS(1).MORE.FIGARO.DATA_ARRAY
*                                 (AXIS(1).DATA_ARRAY is filled with
*                                 pixel co-ordinates)
*            .X.ERRORS       ->   .AXIS(1).MORE.FIGARO.VARIANCE (after
*                                 processing)
*            .X.WIDTH        ->   .AXIS(1).MORE.FIGARO.WIDTH
*
*     -  In addition to creating a blank-keyword NDF FITS-extension
*     header for each component of a non-standard DST FITS structure
*     (.FITS.xxxx.yyyy where yyyy is not DATA or DESCRIPTION), this set
*     of related headers are bracketed by blank lines and a comment
*     containing the name of the structure (i.e. xxxx).
*
*     Bad-pixel handling:
*     The QUALITY array is only copied if the bad-pixel flag
*     (.Z.FLAGGED) is false or absent.  A simple NDF with the bad-pixel
*     flag set to false (meaning that there are no bad-pixels present)
*     is created when .Z.FLAGGED is absent or false and FORM = "SIMPLE".

*  Related Applications:
*     CONVERT: NDF2DST.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  The maximum number of dimensions is 6.

*  History:
*     29-June-1989 (JM):
*        Original version.  See the history of DSA_CONVERT_FORMAT.
*     1992 January 31 (MJC):
*        Greatly expanded the prologue into a form suitable for
*        documentation.  Fixed bugs in the generation of card images
*        in the FITS extension, notably the inclusion of quotes around
*        character strings.  Made the OBS structure preserve its type,
*        namely OBS, within the NDF.
*     1992 February 4 (MJC):
*        The location of the FITS comment is not hardwired for long
*        (>18) character values.  Improved efficiency by removing
*        unnecessary code from a second-level loop.  Made the maximum
*        number of dimensions 7.  Handled axis width as a numeric
*        array, rather than a character scalar.
*     1992 August 15 (MJC):
*        Fixed bug that caused a phantom 2-d FITS structure to be
*        created when there is an empty FITS structure within the DST
*        file.
*     1992 September 3 (MJC):
*        Made provision for the FLAGGED component, also affecting
*        whether or not quality is propagated.  Creates simple NDF where
*        required.  Fixed another occurrence of a logical being used for
*        a data type 'STRUCT'.
*     1992 September 8 (MJC):
*        Improved the documentation and added the rules for
*        non-1-dimensional axis arrays.   Handles axis variance in
*        addition to axis errors.
*     1992 September 10 (MJC):
*        Moved special cases of .OBS.SECZ, .OBS.TIME, .Z.MAGFLAG,
*        .Z.RANGE to the top-level Figaro extension as this is where
*        DSA_ now expects to find them in an NDF.
*     1992 September 28 (MJC):
*        Obtained NDF by SUBPAR calls, not PAR so that the global value
*        is not written in quotes, and thus may be accepted by other
*        applications.  Corrected the closedown sequence of DTA-error
*        reporting.  Added message tokens for the filenames to clarify
*        some error reports.
*     1992 October 13 (MJC):
*        Fixed a bug where given a DST that has a non-empty FITS
*        structure, and an axis array that is missing from the first or
*        second axis, the corresponding NDF axis-centre array is given
*        a dimension equal to the number of FITS headers.
*     1993 October 25 (MJC):
*        Added FORM parameter to control the NDF's storage form rather
*        than use the value of the bad-pixel flag to decide.
*     1993 November 10 (MJC):
*        Allowed the output NDF to be written to an arbitrary structure.
*        Used NDF_ library to access the NDF to enable NDF automatic
*        conversion to work.
*     1995 December 19 (MJC):
*        Places an n-dimensional axis into AXIS.MORE.FIGARO.DATA_ARRAY.
*        Previously, the component name was DATA.
*     1996 February 10 (MJC):
*        Allowed for scalar width in DST.  Fixed bug which prevented a
*        missing axis being created whenever there was no FITS extension
*        to write.
*     1996 September 21 (MJC):
*        ING-style hierarchical keywords may be written when the DST's
*        FITS structure contains non-standard structures.
