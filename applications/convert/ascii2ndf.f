      SUBROUTINE ASCII2NDF( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASCII2NDF

*  Purpose:
*     Converts a text file to an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASCII2NDF( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application converts a text file to an NDF.  Only one of
*     the array components may be created from the input file.
*     Preceding the input data there may be an optional header.  This
*     header may be skipped, or may consist of a simple FITS header.
*     In the former case the shape of the NDF has be to be supplied.

*  Usage:
*     ascii2ndf in out [comp] [skip] shape [type]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The NDF component to be copied.  It may be "Data", "Quality"
*        or "Variance".  To create a variance or quality array the NDF
*        must already exist. ["Data"]
*     FITS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the initial records of the formatted file are
*        interpreted as a FITS header (with one card image per record)
*        from which the shape, data type, and axis centres are derived.
*        The last record of the FITS-like header must be terminated by
*        an END keyword; subsequent records in the input file are
*        treated as an array component given by COMP.  [FALSE]
*     IN = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the input Fortran text file.  The file will normally
*        have variable-length records when there is a header, but
*        always fixed-length records when there is no header.  The
*        maximum record length allowed is 512 bytes.
*     MAXLEN = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The maximum record length in bytes of records within the input
*        text file.  Unless the records are longer than 512 bytes, you
*        can use the default value.  The suggested value is the current
*        value. [512]
*     OUT = NDF (Read and Write)
*        Output NDF data structure.  When COMP is not "Data" the NDF
*        is modified rather than a new NDF created.   It becomes the
*        new current NDF.
*     SHAPE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The shape of the NDF to be created.  For example, [40,30,20]
*        would create 40 columns by 30 lines by 10 bands.  It is only
*        accessed when FITS is FALSE.
*     SKIP = INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of header records to be skipped at the start of the
*        input file before finding the data array or FITS-like header.
*        [0]
*     TYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The data type of the output NDF.  It must be one of the
*        following HDS types: "_BYTE", "_WORD", "_REAL", "_INTEGER",
*        "_DOUBLE", "_UBYTE", "_UWORD" corresponding to signed byte,
*        signed word, real, integer, double precision, unsigned byte,
*        and unsigned word.  See SUN/92 for further details.  An
*        unambiguous abbreviation may be given.  TYPE is ignored when
*        COMP = "Quality" since the QUALITY component must comprise
*        unsigned bytes (equivalent to TYPE = "_UBYTE") to be a valid
*        NDF.  The suggested default is the current value.  TYPE is only
*        accessed when FITS is FALSE. ["_REAL"]

*  Examples:
*     ascii2ndf ngc253.dat ngc253 shape=[100,60]
*        This copies a data array from the text file ngc253.dat to the
*        NDF called ngc253.  The input file does not contain a header
*        section.  The NDF is two-dimensional: 100 elements in x by 60
*        in y.  Its data array has type _REAL.
*     ascii2ndf ngc253q.dat ngc253 q shape=[100,60]
*        This copies a quality array from the text file ngc253q.dat to
*        an existing NDF called ngc253 (such as created in the first
*        example).  The input file does not contain a header section.
*        The NDF is two-dimensional: 100 elements in x by 60 in y.  Its
*        data array has type _UBYTE.
*     ascii2ndf ngc253.dat ngc253 fits
*        This copies a data array from the text file ngc253.dat
*        to the NDF called ngc253.  The input file contains a FITS-like
*        header section, which is copied to the FITS extension of the
*        NDF.  The shape of the NDF is controlled by the mandatory FITS
*        keywords NAXIS, AXIS1, ..., AXISn, and the data type by
*        keywords BITPIX and UNSIGNED.
*     ascii2ndf type='_uword' in=ngc253.dat out=ngc253 maxlen=4000 \
*        This copies a data array from the text file ngc253.dat to the
*        NDF called ngc253.  The input file does not contain a header
*        section.  The NDF has the current shape and data type is
*        unsigned word.  The maximum record length is 4000 bytes.
*     ascii2ndf spectrum zz skip=2 shape=200
*        This copies a data array from the text file spectrum to
*        the NDF called zz.  The input file contains two header records
*        that are ignored.  The NDF is one-dimensional comprising 200
*        elements of type _REAL.
*     ascii2ndf spectrum.lis ZZ skip=1 fits
*        This copies a data array from the text file spectrum.lis to
*        the NDF called ZZ.  The input file contains one header record,
*        that is ignored, followed by a FITS-like header section, which
*        is copied to the FITS extension of the NDF.  The shape of the
*        NDF is controlled by the mandatory FITS keywords NAXIS, AXIS1,
*        ..., AXISn, and the data type by keywords BITPIX and UNSIGNED.

*  Notes:
*     The details of the conversion are as follows:
*        -  the text-file array is written to the NDF array as
*        selected by COMP.  When the NDF is being modified, the shape
*        of the new component must match that of the NDF.
*        -  If the input file contains a FITS-like header, and a new
*        NDF is created, i.e. COMP = "Data", the header records are
*        placed within the NDF's FITS extension.  This enables more
*        than one array (input file) to be used to form an NDF.  Note
*        that the data array must be created first to make a valid NDF,
*        and it's the FITS structure associated with that array that is
*        wanted.  Indeed the application prevents you from doing
*        otherwise.
*
*        -  The FITS-like header defines the properties of the NDF as
*        follows:
*           o  BITPIX defines the data type: 8 gives _BYTE, 16 produces
*           _WORD, 32 makes _INTEGER, -32 gives _REAL, and -64 generates
*           _DOUBLE.  For the first two, if there is an extra header
*           record with the keyword UNSIGNED and logical value T, these
*           types become _UBYTE and _UWORD respectively.  UNSIGNED is
*           non-standard, since unsigned integers would not follow in a
*           proper FITS file.  However, here it is useful to enable
*           unsigned types to be input into an NDF.  UNSIGNED may be
*           created by this application's sister, NDF2ASCII.  BITPIX is
*           ignored for QUALITY data; type _UBYTE is used.
*           o  NAXIS, and NAXISn define the shape of the NDF.
*           o  The TITLE, LABEL, and BUNIT are copied to the NDF
*           TITLE, LABEL, and UNITS NDF components respectively.
*           o  The CDELTn, CRVALn, CTYPEn, and CUNITn keywords make
*           linear axis structures within the NDF.  CUNITn define the
*           axis units, and the axis labels are assigned to CTYPEn. 
*           If some are missing, pixel co-ordinates are used for those
*           axes.
*           o  BSCALE and BZERO in a FITS extension are ignored.
*           o  BLANK is not used to indicate which input array values
*           should be assigned to a standard bad value.
*           o  END indicates the last header record unless it
*           terminates a dummy header, and the actual data is in an
*           extension.
*        -  Other data item such as HISTORY, data ORIGIN, and axis
*        widths are not supported, because the text file has a simple
*        structure to enable a diverse set of input files to be
*        converted to NDFs, and to limitations of the standard FITS
*        header.
