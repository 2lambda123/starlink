      SUBROUTINE IRAF2NDF( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     IRAF2NDF

*  Purpose:
*     Converts an IRAF image to an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IRAF2NDF( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application converts an IRAF image to an NDF.  See the Notes
*     for details of the conversion.

*  Usage:
*     iraf2ndf in out

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the IRAF image.  Note that this excludes the
*        ".imh" file extension.
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The name of the NDF to be produced.
*     PROFITS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the user headers of the IRAF file are written
*        verbatim to the NDF's FITS extension.  Any IRAF history
*        records are also appended to the FITS extension.  The FITS
*        extension is not created if there are no user headers
*        present in the IRAF file. [TRUE]
*     PROHIS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter decides whether or not to create NDF HISTORY
*        records.  Only the IRAF headers with keyword HISTORY, and
*        which originated from NDF HISTORY records are used.  If
*        PROHIS=TRUE, NDF HISTORY records are created.  [TRUE]

*  Examples:
*     iraf2ndf ell_galaxy new_galaxy
*        Converts the IRAF image ell_galaxy (comprising files
*        ell_galaxy.imh and ell_galaxy.pix) to an NDF called new_galaxy.
*     iraf2ndf ell_galaxy new_galaxy noprofits noprohis
*        As above, except no FITS extension is created, and NDF-style
*        HISTORY lines in ell_galaxy.imh are not transferred to HISTORY
*        records in NDF new_galaxy.

*  Notes:
*     The rules for the conversion are as follows:
*     -  The NDF data array is copied from the ".pix" file.
*     -  The title of the IRAF image (object i_title in the ".imh"
*     header file) becomes the NDF title.  Likewise headers OBJECT and
*     BUNIT become the NDF label and units respectively.
*     -  The pixel origin is set if any LBOUNDn headers are present.
*     -  Lines from the IRAF image header file may be transferred to
*     the FITS extension of the NDF, when PROFITS=TRUE.  Any 
*     compulsory FITS keywords that are missing are added.  Certain
*     other keywords are not propagated.  These are the IRAF "Mini
*     World Coordinate System" (MWCS) keywords WCSDIM, DC_FLAG,
*     WATd_nnn (d is dimension, nnn is the line number).  Certain
*     NDF-style HISTORY lines in the header are also be ignored when
*     PROHIS=TRUE (see two notes below).
*     -  When PROFITS=TRUE, lines from the HISTORY section of the IRAF
*     image are also extracted and added to the NDF's FITS extension as
*     FITS HISTORY lines.  Two extra HISTORY lines are added to record
*     the original name of the image and the date of the format
*     conversion.
*     -  When PROHIS=TRUE, any HISTORY lines in the IRAF headers, which
*     originated from an NDF2IRAF conversion of NDF HISTORY records.
*     Such headers are not transferred to the FITS airlock, when
*     PROFITS=TRUE.
*     -  Most axis information can be propagated either from standard
*     FITS-like keywords, or certain MCWS headers.  Supported systems
*     and formats are listed below.
*        o  FITS
*           - linear
*           - log-linear
*        o  Equispec
*           - linear
*           - log-linear
*        o  Multispec
*           - linear
*           - log-linear
*           - Chebyshev and Legendre polynomials
*           - Linear and cubic Spline
*           - Explicit list of co-ordinates
*
*     However, for Multispec axes, only the first (spec1) axis
*     co-ordinates are transferred to the NDF AXIS centres.  Any
*     spec2...specn co-ordinates, present when the data array is not
*     one-dimensional or multiple fits have been stored, are ignored.
*     The weights for multiple fits are thus also ignored.  The data
*     type of the axis centres is _REAL or _DOUBLE depending on the
*     number of significant digits in the co-ordinates or coefficients.
*
*     The axis labels and units are also propagated, where present, to
*     the NDF AXIS structure.  In the FITS system, these are derived
*     from the CTYPEn and CUNITn keywords.  In the MWCS, these
*     components originate in the label and units parameters.

*     The redshift correction, when present, is applied to the MCWS
*     axis co-ordinates.

*  Related Applications:
*     CONVERT: NDF2IRAF.

*  Pitfalls:
*     -  Bad pixels in the IRAF image are not replaced.
*     -  Some of the routines required for accessing the IRAF header
*     file are written in SPP.  Macros are used to find the start of the
*     header line section, this constitutes an `Interface violation' as
*     these macros are not part of the IMFORT interface specification.
*     It is possible that these may be changed in the future, so
*     beware.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  Only handles one-, two-, and three-dimensional IRAF files.
*     -  The NDF produced has type _WORD or _REAL corresponding to the
*     type of the IRAF image.  (The IRAF imfort FORTRAN subroutine
*     library only supports these data types: signed words and real.)
*     The pixel type of the image can be changed from within IRAF using
*     the 'chpixtype' task in the 'images' package.
*
*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     -  Does not support wildcards.
*     -  There is no facility for taking an IRAF bad-pixel-mask file,
*     to set bad pixels in the NDF.

*  History:
*     20-SEP-1992 (RAHM):
*        Original version.
*     23-NOV-1992 (RAHM):
*        Produces NDFs of type UWORD from IRAF short integer
*        type images.
*     9-JUL-1993 (RAHM):
*        Added VERBOSE parameter and tidied up.
*     1993 July 23 (MJC):
*        Reworked the prologue to a standard arrangement.  Tidied, made
*        to conform to SGP/16.  Made to work for cubes.  Fixed some
*        bugs.
*     1993 July 28 (MJC):
*        Removed the VERBOSE parameter.  This functionality should be
*        provided by a global parameter.
*     1993 September 30 (MJC):
*        Do not copy standard FITS headers already added to the FITS
*        extension.
*     08-AUG-1995 (GJP):
*        Modified the method used to obtain the date/time string to
*        avoid the use of pointer.  Gave up PSX_ASCTIME and used
*        PSX_CTIME instead.
*     09-AUG 1995 (GJP):
*        Removed erroneous mention of LIN2MAP, PREFITS and PUTLIN.
*     09-AUG-1995 (GJP):
*        Added the ability to generate a sensible error message when
*        IMOPEN fails - as would happen if the file requested did 
*        not exist.
*     11-AUG-1995 (GJP):
*        Added a check to see if any header lines were found before 
*        calling GETLIN to obtain them.
*     1997 April and July (MJC):
*        Added PROFITS and PROHIS facilities.  Now propagates axis
*        information, and the NDF label and units.  Expanded and
*        corrected the documentation, including a second example.
*        Improved the code structure.  Removed the conversion of the
*        IRAF filename to lowercase.
*     1997 September 25 (MJC):
*        Protect against case where PROFITS=TRUE but there are no
*        headers.
*     13-NOV-1997 (AJC):
*        Set bounds of NDF according to LBOUNDn keywords if any.
*        Correct number of arguments to CON_CI2DW/CI2DR.
*     1997 November 17 (MJC):
*        No longer attempts to close the IRAF file if the open-file
*        subroutine fails.  IMCLOS crashes otherwise.  Propagates all
*        IRAF history records (including blanks) to the FITS airlock
*        when PROFITS=TRUE.  IRAF HISTORY lines which are too long for
*        a FITS header are truncated with an ellipsis.
