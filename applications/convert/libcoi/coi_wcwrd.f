      SUBROUTINE COI_WCWRD( HEADER, PARAM, VALUE, THERE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COI_WCWRD

*  Purpose:
*     Extracts IRAF MWCS parameter values from header cards.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COI_WCWRD( HEADER, PARAM, VALUE, THERE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine takes an IRAF MWCS header card of the form
*
*        WATd_nnn= 'param1=value1 param2=value2'
*
*     and returns the value for a named parameter.  Values are either
*     terminated by spaces or the trailing quotes.  Values may be
*     enclosed in "" quotes; these are necessary whenever the value
*     has embedded spaces.
*
*     A returned flag indicates whether the parameter was present.

*  Arguments:
*     HEADER = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The IRAF MCWS WATd_nnn header card.  It should be 80 characters
*        long.
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter whose value is required.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The parameter value, when THERE is returned .TRUE..  The value
*        is truncated to the length of this argument, should the former
*        exceed the latter.
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        It is .TRUE. when the named parameter is present in the
*        supplied header.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     It does assume that the parameter name in the WAT header will
*     always be in lowercase.
