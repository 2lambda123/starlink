      SUBROUTINE COI_HEADS( IMDESC, IRAFIL, NDF, NHEAD, RETAIN,
     :                      PROHIS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COI_HEADS

*  Purpose:
*     Creates the FITS airlock in an NDF from IRAF headers and history.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COI_HEADS( IMDESC, IRAFIL, NDF, NHEAD, RETAIN, PROHIS,
*                     STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates a FITS airlock in the supplied NDF, and fills
*     it with IRAF OIF-format headers.  If the FITS mandatory headers
*     are missing, they are inserted prior to the copy.  Following the
*     headers, records from the IRAF history information are written
*     as HISTORY cards in the airlock (any records > 70 characters will
*     be truncated with ...).  Next some information (application and
*     time) concerning the conversion process are appended to the
*     airlock HISTORY cards.  Finally, an END card is written.
*
*     To prevent HISTORY headers that originated from an NDF's HISTORY
*     records from duplicating and multiplying in the airlock, and to
*     indicate any other headers we wish not to move to the airlock,
*     there is a logical array specifying the cards (in order) to copy.

*  Arguments:
*     IMDESC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The IMFORT file descriptor.
*     IRAFIL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the IRAF file.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the output NDF.
*     NHEAD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of IRAF headers.
*     RETAIN( NHEAD ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Flags to indicate whether or not to propagate each IRAF header
*        line to the NDF's FITS airlock.
*     PROHIS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., NDF-style HISTORY records are restored to HISTORY
*        records.  If .FALSE., any such headers are merely propagated
*        to the FITS airlock.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     Both the NDF and IRAF must be open, with the former having write
*     access.
