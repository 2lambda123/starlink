      SUBROUTINE COI_WHEAD( NDF, COMP, IMDESC, BITPIX, PROPEX, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COI_WHEAD

*  Purpose:
*     Writes the FITS header derived from an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COI_WHEAD( NDF, COMP, IMDESC, BITPIX, PROPEX, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates the headers in the output IMFORT OIF file
*     based upon information in an NDF.
*
*     There are two stages:
*     a) Inquire of the NDF its shape, type, character components,
*     and axis components; and write these to the header.
*     b) Look for a FITS extension if requested to do so.  If one is
*     present append the headers contained therein to the OIF header
*     section, but not replacing any of the headers created in stage
*     a).

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF.
*     COMP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The array component to write to the HDU.
*     IMDESC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The IRAF IMFORT image descriptor.
*     BITPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The BITPIX value for the output OIF file.
*     PROPEX = LOGICAL (Given)
*        The NDF FITS extension, if present, is folded into the output
*        FITS header when PROPEX is .TRUE..  When PROPEX is .FALSE.,
*        the FITS extension is ignored.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The rules for the conversion for ancillary information written to
*     the OIF ".imh" header file in FITS-like headers are as follows:
*     -  The IRAF mini world co-ordinate system (MWCS) is used to
*     record axis information whenever one of the following criteria is
*     satisfied:
*
*        1) the dataset has some linear axes (system=world);
*
*        2) the dataset is one-dimensional with a non-linear axis, or is
*           two-dimensional with the first axis non-linear and the
*           second being some aperture number or index
*           (system=multispec);
*
*        3) the dataset has a linear spectral/dispersion axis along the
*           first dimension and all other dimensions are pixel indices
*           (system=equispec).
*
*     -  The NDF title, label, units are written to the header keywords
*     TITLE, OBJECT, and BUNIT respectively if they are defined.
*     Otherwise anys values for these keywords found in the FITS
*     extension are used (provided parameter PROFITS is TRUE).  There
*     is a limit of twenty characters for each.
*     _  The NDF pixel origins are stored in keywords LBOUNDn for the
*     nth dimension when any of the pixel origins is not equal to 1.
*     -  Keywords HDUCLAS1, HDUCLASn are set to "NDF" and the
*     array-component name respectively.
*     -  The BLANK keyword is set to the Starlink standard bad value,
*     but only for the _WORD data type and not for a quality array.  It
*     appears regardless of whether or not there are bad values
*     actually present in the array.
*     -  HISTORY headers are propagated from the FITS extension when
*     PROFITS is TRUE, and from the NDF history component when PROHIS
*     is TRUE.
*     -  If there is a FITS extension in the NDF, then the elements up
*     to the first END keyword of this are added to the `user area' of
*     the IRAF header file when PROFITS=TRUE.  However, certain
*     keywords are excluded: SIMPLE, NAXIS, NAXISn, BITPIX, EXTEND,
*     PCOUNT, GCOUNT, BSCALE, BZERO, END, and any already created from
*     standard components of the NDF listed above.
*     -  All other NDF components are ignored.

*  ===========================

*  Write out the few special headers irrespective of the presence or
*  otherwise of a FITS extension in the NDF.  These are:
*    SIMPLE, EXTEND, PCOUNT, GCOUNT --- all take their default values.
*    BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXISn --- are derived directly from the NDF data
*      array;
*    LBOUNDn --- the pixel lower bounds of an NDF whose origin is
*      not 1 along each axis.  (These are not part of the standard.)
*    CRVALn, CDELTn, CRPIXn, CTYPEn, CUNITn --- are derived from the
*      NDF axis structures if possible.  If no linear NDF axis
*      structures are present, the values in the NDF FITS extension are
*      copied.  If any are non-linear, all FITS axis information is
*      lost.
*    OBJECT, LABEL, BUNIT --- the values held in NDF TITLE, LABEL,
*      and UNITS respectively are used if present, otherwise any values
*      found in the FITS extension are used.
*    ORIGIN and DATE --- are created automatically.  However the former
*      may be overriden by the entry in the NDF extension.
*    BLANK --- is created for integer data types from the bad value.
