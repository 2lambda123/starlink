      SUBROUTINE COI_FILAX( NVALUE, VALUE, Z, EL, CENTRE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COI_FILAX

*  Purpose:
*     Creates axis centres within an NDF from Multispec ftype=5 axis
*     information in an IRAF header.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COI_FILAX( NVALUE, VALUE, Z, EL, CENTRE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine takes the part of the spec1 value string containing
*     the axis values, extracts the values and fills the axis-centre
*     array with them.  The axis centres have type double-precision
*     The spec1 value is derived from the WAT2_nnn headers which define
*     an axis structure stored using the IRAF Mini World Co-ordinate
*     System (MWCS) in the Multispec format.  The redshift correction is
*     applied.
*
*     INDEF values are converted to the bad value.

*  Arguments:
*     NVALUE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of axis values in the VALUE buffer. (Word 12 from
*        the spec1 parameter.)  This should be no more than the value of
*        argument EL.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Buffer containing the space-separated values of the axis
*        centres derived from the extract spec1 parameter in the
*        WAT2_nnn headers.  The first word should be the first value.
*     Z = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Redshift.  This is normally 0.  The axis centres are scaled
*        by 1/(1+Z).
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of axis values in the axis centre-array.
*     CENTRE( EL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The array axis centres.  When NVALUE is less than EL, the array
*        is padded to EL elements with the bad value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
