      SUBROUTINE COI_SPECN( IMDESC, WORD, END, NUMBER, HEADER, OPOS,
     :                      STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COI_SPECN

*  Purpose:
*     Creates the WAT1_nnn cards for a series of words.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COI_SPECN( IMDESC, WORD, END, NUMBER, HEADER, OPOS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine forms and writes WAT1_nnn IRAF MWCS header cards
*     to an OIF header file.  The supplied word is appended to the
*     current header under construction with a trailing space, provided
*     there is room.  If there is no room, the current header is
*     terminated with a closing quote, and written to the OIF file;
*     and the value is appended to the next header where the header
*     number is incremented by 1.

*  Arguments:
*     IMDESC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The IRAF IMFORT image descriptor.
*     WORD = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The word to append to the header.
*     END = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., the supplied word is the last, and so the final
*        closing double quote should be inserted before the single
*        quote and the header written.
*     NUMBER = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of the header under construction.  For example, if
*        NUMBER=3, the header keyword would be WAT1_003.  If a new
*        header is started the supplied value will be incremented by 1
*        on exit.
*     HEADER = CHARACTER * ( 80 ) (Given and Returned)
*        The header under construction.
*     OPOS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The column in the header from where the next value is to be
*        written.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
