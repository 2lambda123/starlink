1 CONVERT
 The CONVERT package contains some of the numerous format-conversion
 routines which are necessary to translate data files to and from the
 Starlink standard n-Dimensional-data format--the NDF---described in
 SUN/33 and SGP/38.  CONVERT commands are available from ICL and UNIX
 shell.

 The commands available are:

     ASCII2NDF -- Converts an ASCII file to an NDF.
     AST2NDF   -- Converts an Asterix data-cube to an NDF.
     DA2NDF    -- Converts a direct-access unformatted file to an NDF.
     DST2NDF   -- Converts a Figaro (Version 2) DST file to an NDF.
     FITS2NDF  -- Converts FITS files into NDFs.
     GASP2NDF  -- Converts an image in GASP format to an NDF.
     GIF2NDF   -- Converts a GIF file to an NDF.
     IRAF2NDF  -- Converts an IRAF image to an NDF.
     IRCAM2NDF -- Converts an IRCAM data file to a series of NDFs.
     NDF2ASCII -- Converts an NDF to an ASCII file.
     NDF2DA    -- Converts an NDF to a direct-access unformatted file.
     NDF2DST   -- Converts an NDF to a Figaro (Version 2) DST file.
     NDF2FITS  -- Converts an NDF to a FITS file.
     NDF2GASP  -- Converts a two-dimensional NDF into a GASP image.
     NDF2GIF   -- Converts a two-dimensional NDF into a GIF file.
     NDF2IRAF  -- Converts an NDF to an IRAF (OIF) image.
     NDF2PGM   -- Converts a two-dimensional NDF into a PGM file.
     NDF2TIFF  -- Converts a two-dimensional NDF into a TIFF file.
     NDF2UNF   -- Converts an NDF to a sequential unformatted file.
     SPECX2NDF -- Converts a SPECX map into a simple data cube, or
                  SPECX data files to individual spectra. 
     TIFF2NDF  -- Converts a TIFF file to an NDF.
     UNF2NDF   -- Converts a sequential unformatted file to an NDF.

 In addition there are four IDL procedures:
     READ_NDF  -- Reads an NDF into an IDL array.
     WRITE_NDF -- Writes an IDL array to an NDF.
     HDS2IDL   -- Creates an IDL structure from an HDS file
     IDL2HDS   -- Creates an HDS file from an IDL structure

 Full details can be found in SUN/55.

 To make all the format-conversion routines available, type

     ICL> convert

 from ICL, or 

     % convert

 from the UNIX shell.  Then type the appropriate command to perform the
 conversion.
