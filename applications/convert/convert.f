      SUBROUTINE CONVERT( ACTION, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CONVERT

*  Purpose:
*     Top-level ADAM monolith routine for the CONVERT package.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CONVERT( ACTION, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine interprets the action name passed to it and calls
*     the appropriate routine to perform the specified action. An error
*     will be reported and STATUS will be set if the action name is not
*     recognised.

*  Arguments:
*     ACTION = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The action name to be interpreted. The value given will be
*        forced to upper case by this routine.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
