#  Name:
#     ast_dev

#  Purpose:
#     Create links to EXTREME include files.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This command creates (or removes) symbolic links in your current
#     directory which refer to the EXTREME include files. It is provided so
#     that you may develop software which uses these files without having
#     to know where they reside.

#  Invocation:
#     ext_dev [option]

#  Arguments:
#     option
#        If no value is supplied for this argument, symbolic links to EXTREME
#        include files (for both Fortran and C) are created in your current
#        directory. If the value ``remove'' is given, these links are
#        removed. Any other value results in an error.

#  Examples:
#     ext_dev
#        Creates links to the EXTREME include files in your current directory.
#     ext_dev remove
#        Removes any links to the EXTREME include files from your current
#        directory.

#  Implementation Notes:
#     The pathname of the installation include directory (e.g. /star/include)
#     must be edited into this script when it is installed. This is normally
#     done by the makefile.

#  Interpret command line.
      case "${1}" in

#  No arguments: create appropriate links.
