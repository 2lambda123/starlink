*  Name:
*     extreme.h
*
*  Purpose:
*     Macros for EXTREME package.
*
*  Language:
*     C
*
*  Type of module:
*     C include file.
*
*  Description:
*     This file may be included in C code which uses the INT_BIG identifier
*     as an integer type.  It defines the value of INT_BIG if it is not
*     already defined (e.g. on the compiler command line), and it
*     sets up constants for the maximum and minimum values of the
*     resulting integral types.
*
*  Author:
*     MBT: Mark Taylor (Starlink)
*
*  History:
*     3-FEB-2000 (MBT):
*        Original version.
