#  Name:
#     extfpre
#
#  Purpose:
#     Preprocess a fortran file prior to compiling it.
#
#  Description:
#     This filter replaces any `INTEGER * 8' declarations by `INTEGER' ones.
#     Additionally, it looks for INCLUDEd files, and appends a string
#     to their filename.  If the file so named does not exist, one is 
#     created by preprocessing the original filename in the same way
#     as the rest of the output of this script.
#
#  Notes:
#     - Should rewrite this in sed or awk probably rather than perl once 
#       we know exactly what it has to do.
#
#     - As it stands, use of this script can result in extra *_EXTFPRE
#       files being created in the build directory not under control of
#       the makefile.  If the makefile is written to create such
#       preprocessed INCLUDE files explicitly though, this can be avoided.
