  <description>Handling Extreme Data Sets</description>
  <abstract>
  <p>This package provides some utilities, background documentation,
  and associated files for adapting the Starlink Software Collection,
  and software which uses it, to handle very large data sets.
  The principal focus of this is to move to use of 64 bits of address
  space on 64-bit operating systems.</p>

  <p>This document (SSN/73) is squarely aimed at the problem of adapting the
  Starlink Software Collection, and consequently focuses on
  the three operating systems (Solaris, Linux and Tru64) supported by Starlink,
  the compiled languages Fortran 77 and ANSI C,
  and Starlink's somewhat idiosyncratic build mechanisms.
  However, some of the discussion here may be of interest or use to
  people who are considering the change from 32 to 64 bits for
  software in other contexts.
