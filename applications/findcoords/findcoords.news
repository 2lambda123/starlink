1 FINDCOORDS -- Finding the Coordinates of a Named Object

  findcoords is a new utility for using the name of an astronomical object
  to look up its equatorial coordinates.  You simply enter the name of
  the object and its coordinates are displayed.  Type:

    findcoords  object-name

  For example:

    findcoords  ngc3379

  The object-name should be entered without embedded spaces.  The case of
  letters (upper or lower) is not significant.  If the name is recognised
  then the equatorial coordinates of the object will be displayed.  The
  Right Ascension is shown in sexagesimal hours and the Declination in
  sexagesimal degrees; both are for equinox J2000.

  findcoords works by submitting a remote query via the Internet to the
  version of the SIMBAD name-resolver provided by ESO (the basic SIMBAD is
  maintained by the Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg, CDS).
  Consequently, findcoords will only work on computers with a suitable
  Internet connection.  Also, the name given must be recognised by SIMBAD,
  though the latter's dictionary of names is very extensive.

  findcoords is documented (insofar as any documentation is necessary) in
  SUN/240.  To view an on-line version type:
