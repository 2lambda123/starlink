      SUBROUTINE PISAPEAK( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PISAPEAK

*  Purpose:
*     PISAPEAK transforms the PISAFIND parameterisations so that the
*     variables are intensity invariant.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PISAPEAK( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     PISAPEAK reads in the object parameterisations file produced by
*     PISAFIND. Using the PISA profiling function it then transforms
*     certain of the variables into values which are intensity
*     invariant for a radial stellar profile. Two of the output
*     variables may have values of around 1.0 for objects which are
*     well represented by the given PISA profiling parameters. The
*     variables produced are the ratio of the semi-major axis of the
*     object fit to the radius of an object whose peak intensity is the
*     same, but whose size is determined by the PISA profiling function
*     (a peakedness measure). The ratio of the integrated intensity to
*     the peak intensity and the model object ratio. The ellipticity
*     (unmodified) and the absolute value of the intensity weighted
*     cross moment (ABS(SXY)).
*
*     The output from PISAPEAK can be used in star-galaxy separation,
*     either by applying direct cuts in variable values or by
*     discrimination analysis routines such as PISAKNN.

*  Usage:
*     PISAPEAK IN FINDDATA RESULTS GSIGM CROSS COMIX BACKGROUND THRESH

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BACKGROUND = _REAL (Read)
*        The frame background value (sky) as used by PISAFIND. [Global]
*     COMIX = _REAL (Read)
*        The mixture coefficient, as a fraction of the Gaussian peak,
*        of a Lorentzian function used to model the wings of the stellar
*        profile. At each point in the analytical profile the Lorentzian
*        function is added to the Gaussian/exponential core scaled by
*        the mixture coefficient. [Global]
*     CROSS = _REAL (Read)
*        The crossover point, as a percentage of the Gaussian peak,
*        where an exponential fall-off in the analytical stellar profile
*        takes over from the Gaussian core. The exponential function is
*        joined on smoothly to the Gaussian. [Global]
*     FINDDATA = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the file containing the PISAFIND parameterisations.
*        [PISAFIND.DAT]
*     GSIGM = _REAL (Read)
*        The standard deviation, in pixels, of the Gaussian core of the
*        analytical stellar profile. [Global]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF containing the objects which have been parameterised by
*        PISAFIND.
*     RESULTS = FILENAME (Write)
*        Name of a file to contain the PISAPEAK results. [PISAPEAK.DAT]
*     THRESH = _REAL (Read)
*        The detection threshold as used by PISAFIND. [Global]

*  Examples:
*     PISAPEAK IN=FRAME FINDDATA=PISAFIND.DAT RESULTS=PISAPEAK.DAT
*        BACKGROUND=255 THRESH=12
*        This example shows PISAPEAK using the objects found in NDF
*        FRAME with parameters stored in file PISAFIND.DAT. The results
*        are stored in file PISAPEAK.DAT. Note that the model parameters
*        GSIGM CROSS and COMIX are defaulted to those which have been
*        stored in GLOBAL. These values were probably written by the
*        routine PISAFIT which uses a list of stars to fit the PISA
*        profiling function. The background value and threshold are
*        those used by PISAFIND when detecting and parameterising the
*        objects.

*  Notes:
*     -  The model profile is used to scale the object values to those
*     around unity. This only works well if the PISA profiling function
*     is a good fit to the stars on your frame. If it is not a good fit
*     or you cannot determine the model parameters then inaccurate
*     values can be used, the only criterion being that the GSIGM value
*     is about the FWHM seeing of your data. The results file will now
*     contain values 'normalised' to this 'imaginary' object. The stars
*     will still form a group of objects with similar values, although
*     they will not be as tightly clustered as with a good fit.
