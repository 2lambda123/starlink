1 PISA_update

 This is a minor upgrade to PISA with the following change:

   A workaround for a crash that occurs in PISAFIND when too many
   pixels are accumulated in a single object has been added. When this
   occurs the application should now gracefully exit.

 PISA is documented in SUN/109 or try the showme sun109 command.
