The TRACE utility for listing the names, data types, and values of
arbitrary HDS structures and objects is now available on UNIX platforms.
To prevent a clash with the UNIX command "trace", it now has the
more-descriptive name of HDSTRACE.  See SUN/102.3 for details and
examples of how to use HDSTRACE. 

You run HDSTRACE from various command languages by entering the 
appropriate one of 

UNIX shell:
    % hdstrace

DCL:
    $ HDSTRACE

ICL
    ICL> HDSTRACE

and HDSTRACE will prompt you for the HDS structure or object to be
listed.  Note that the TRACE command will continue to invoke the utility
on VMS systems.
