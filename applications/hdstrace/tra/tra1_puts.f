      SUBROUTINE TRA1_PUTS( NDIM, DIMS, IVALUE, VALUE, COMMA, INDS,
     :                      LINE, LENG, FULL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TRA1_PUTS

*  Purpose:
*     Put the supplied value string in the supplied text line.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      CALL TRA1_PUTS( NDIM, DIMS, IVALUE, VALUE, COMMA, INDS, LINE,
*    :                LENG, FULL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied value string is planted in the text line followed by
*     an optional comma.  The line length and array indices are updated
*     as appropriate.  The routine determines whether or not there is
*     enough room to plant the value string, and returns a logical flag
*     stating what has happened.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimensionality of the object.
*     DIMS( DAT__MXDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimensions of the object.
*     IVALUE = INTEGER (Given)
*        Index to the value if the object is a vector.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Value string.
*     COMMA = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true a comma is written after the value.
*     INDS = CHARACTER (Given and Returned)
*        Array indices
*     LINE = CHARACTER*(*) (Given and Returned)
*        Line of text to be appended
*     LENG = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Current length of the characters in LINE excluding any trailing
*        blanks.
*     FULL = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true the line given was full.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     At present, this ignores the true dimensionality, and produces
*     a list of values seperated by commas.

*  History:
*     17-FEB-1983 (JRG):
*        Original version.
*     1989 May 16 (MJC):
*        Tidied and extended the prologue; added COMMA argument.
*     1989 Jun 15 (MJC):
*        Renamed from LSDIR to avoid confusion with the original TRACE
*        version; added STATUS argument and check.
*     1991 January 30 (MJC):
*        Converted to SST prologue.
