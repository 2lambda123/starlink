      SUBROUTINE TRA_ARELM( NELEM, NDIM, DIMS, CDIMS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TRA_ARELM

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate dimension indices for a vectorised array element.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TRA_ARELM( NELEM, NDIM, DIMS, CDIMS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The indices, %CDIMS, to the %NELEM'th element of the vectorised
*     array with actual dimensionality %NDIM and actual dimensions
*     %DIMS are calculated.

*  Arguments:
*     NELEM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of the element for which the dimension indices are to
*        be calculated.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimensionality of the array under consideration.
*     DIMS( DAT__MXDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimensions of the array under consideration.
*     CDIMS( DAT__MXDIM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Dimension indices for the NELEM'th element.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     Adjust the vectorised index by subtracting 1 because it is easier
*       to calculate the dimension indices if the first element of the
*       array is treated as being indexed as 0,0,0...
*     For all the dimensions
*        Index in this dimension to the NELEM'th element of the array is
*          the remainder of the division of VALUE by this dimension of
*          the array
*        1 is added to restore first element to 1,1,1...
*        Modify VALUE to take into account that have dealt with this
*          dimension
*     Endfor
