 PSMERGE is a program for manipulating Encapsulated PostScript Files,
 (EPSF).  It allows one or more EPS files to be combined in on one
 PostScript or EPS file with each included file scaled, rotated or
 shifted independently.

 A description of the use of PSMERGE can be found in `PSMERGE - Encapsulated
 PostScript Handling Utility' (SUN/164).  There is a hypertext version 
 available (`showme sun164' or `findme psmerge').

 v1.0-7 now released under the GPL.

 v1.0-6 build using GNU autotools.

 v1.0-5 is a maintenance release to update the PSMERGE makefile and solve a bug
 in the arguement handling, which caused arguments like '-t0x72' to cause a
 segmentation violation on Linux.
