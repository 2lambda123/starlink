#  Name:
#     read_docslis
#
#  Invocation:
#     ( $r_docs, $r_authors ) = read_docslis( $docslisfile )
#
#  Purpose:
#     Read and parse the docs_lis file.
#
#  Description:
#     This routine reads the docs_lis file which usually lives in 
#     /star/docs.  It obviously relies heavily on that file having the 
#     right format.  It returns data structures containing the useful
#     information from that file.
#
#  Arguments:
#     $docslisfile = string:
#        Pathname of the docs_lis file.
#
#  Return values:
#     \%docs = ref to hash:
#        The keys of the hash are document names in the form 'sun666' etc.
#        The values are refs to a hash with keys 'version', 'date', 
#        'authinit', 'pages' and 'title'.  As in the docs_lis file, 
#        author initials (authinit) entries in lower case indicate that
#        the named author is first, rather than sole, author.
#     \%authors = ref to hash:
#        The keys of the hash are the author's initials, as per the 
#        'authint' entries of the docs hash, in upper case.  The values 
#        are refs to a hash with keys 'name' and 'site'.
