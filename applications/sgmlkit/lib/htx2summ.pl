#  Name:
#     htx2summ.pl
#
#  Purpose:
#     Write summary file from information in .htx directory.
#
#  Usage:
#     htx2summ.pl htxdir [ latexfile ]
#
#  Description:
#     This script gathers information from various places, but
#     principally the .htx file, in order to write a summary file 
#     containing the structure of a starlink document, conforming to
#     the Starlink Summary DTD.
#
#     It makes use of the htx.index file and the html files themselves.
#     The htx.index file contains almost all the information which 
#     is required, but it lacks the sectioning structure (i.e. which
#     of the html files represent sections, which subsections, etc).
#     It therefore makes a cursory examination of each html file
#     and looks to see what is the first H[1-6] element it can find
#     For performance reasons, it doesn't do a proper parse of the
#     files, so errors are possible.
#
#     It also, optionally, examines the corresponding latex file.
#     The only purpose of this is to try to work out where normal
#     sectioning finishes and appendix sectioning begins (and hence
#     where to place the APPENDICES start tag in the summary).  
#     If no latex file is specified it assumes all sections are
#     normal ones.  It can only guarantee to get the appendix 
#     placement right if there is an explicit \xlabel command in the
#     section preceeding and in the one succeeding the \appendix command
#     in the latex.  If this is not the case, it will warn on standard
#     error that placement may be incorrect.
#
#     Finally, it reads the $STARLINK/docs/docs_lis file to find the 
#     principal authors of the document.  Absence of this file, or of
#     an appropriate entry in this file, is logged to standard error,
#     but is not fatal.  In this case, an empty AUTHOR element is 
#     written to the summary file.
#
#     A summary file is printed on standard output.
#
#  Command line arguments:
#     htxdir
#        This is the name of a directory containing the HTX document.
#        It must contain an htx.index file, and the html files 
#        referred to therein.
#     latexfile (optional)
#        This is the name of the latex file corresponding to the
#        HTX directory.  It is only used for one thing, to try to
#        determine where normal sections finish and appendices start.
#        If this file is not specified, the summary file is written
#        as though all sections are normal sections.
