#  Name:
#    search-catalogue.sh
#
#  Type of module:
#    Shell script.
#
#  Purpose:
#    Provide HTTP access to SGML catalogs.
#
#  Usage:
#    To be installed as a CGI script.  See below.
#
#  Description:
#    The script is invoked as a CGI script, through a URL like
#    http://server/catalogue/public/-//Starlink//DTD%20Starlink%200.6//EN
#    (that is, a URL with any spaces encoded as % escapes, as
#    described in the URI spec (RFC 2396, section 2.4.1).
#    The CGI specification is managed at <http://www.w3.org/CGI/>.
#
#    The script wraps the two applications ospcat and ospent, which come
#    with the OpenSP distribution.  It obtains its argument (the
#    identifier which is to be resolved) by examining the environment
#    variable PATH_INFO, which the web server has set.  It normalises
#    this by removing leading and trailing spaces, and collapsing
#    multiple whitespace.  If it finds a catalogue entry and
#    corresponding system entity, it returns the entity.  If it can't
#    find the entry, or it does find it but can't find the
#    corresponding entity, it returns an HTTP 404 code.
#
#    Different types of searches can be done on the catalogue.  The
#    script examines its own name, and searches for entries which
#    match it.  Therefore, if the script is installed as `public' (the
#    usual case), then it will search for public identifiers; if it is
#    installed as `system', it will search for system identifiers.
#    Such a scheme doesn't make sense for all of the entry types in
#    the catalogue, only for those (including public, system and
#    entity) which make a mapping from one identifier to another.
#
#  Installation:
#    It should be installed in the web server tree, in such as way
#    that it's recognised as a CGI script.  As described above, the
#    script's action depends on the name used to invoke it, so that it
#    should be installed as a link named `public' (in the usual case).
#
#    A suitable set of configuration options (for the Apache server)
#    is therefore
#
#      access.conf:
#          <Directory /local1/www/scripts/catalogue>
#          AllowOverride None
#          Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
#          </Directory>
#  
#      srm.conf:
#          ScriptAlias /catalogue/ /local1/www/scripts/catalogue/
#  
#      and with the link
#  
#          /local1/www/scripts/catalogue/public -> 
#             /home/norman/s/src/sgml/w/sgml/lib/catalogue_server.pl
#
#    You will need to edit the paths and the definition of
#    SGML_CATALOG_FILES at the top of the script.  
#
#    Note that this script requires the `ospcat' application, which is
#    present in the OpenSP-1.4 distribution, but not in openjade-1.3.
#    The current jade distribution included in the Starlink SGML Kit
#    is based on the latter, so the ospcat application will not be
#    present in the Kit, and this script will not work.  That is,
#    this script is currently designed to work only on selected
#    servers, and not as an integral part of the Starlink SGML Kit.
