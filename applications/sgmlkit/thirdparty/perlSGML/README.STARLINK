This is an import of Earl Hood's perlSGML of 1997 September 18, as
obtained from http://search.cpan.org/~ehood/perlSGML.1997Sep18/

It's imported because building the SGML-kit documentation requires
perlSGML's DTD parser.  Since we want components to build unattended,
it's not reasonable to ask the builder to download this, even if we
give very direct instructions.  ../../configure.ac expects to find
this unpacked in this current location.

perlSGML is GPLed, so this is presumably OK.

This isn't in the thirdparty/ tree at the top level, because it's
only this component that would ever use this (if this becomes false,
then move it, as long as the automatic configuration still works), and
because the fact that this component uses is it is `private' to it.
