<subsect id=release-0.4 export>Release Notes, version DR-0.4

<p>This is developers' release 0.4.

<subsubsect>New in this release

<p>After a long discussion at the August programmers' meeting, and a
detailed discussion with Mark Taylor, there have been numerous changes
of detail, but few substantial additions.

<subsubsect>Changes

<p>The following are the changes agreed after the last meeting.
<dl>

<dt>Equations
<dd>Equations are now numbered, and can be referred to.  The
definition of the equation elements has changed slightly, with the
addition of the MLINE content to MEQNARRAY and the addition of the
MLABEL element.  Generation of the GIF versions of the equations is
smoother (well, should be -- I'm still unsure how sensitive the
dvi2bitmap program is to its &tex; environment).

<dt>Tables
<dd>There is now a TABULAR element for tablar material, which sits
within the TABLE element, which is responsible for matters such as
captioning and floating the result.  This orthogonality means that
TABULAR is now a `structuring' element, at the same level as elements
like BLOCKQUOTE and lists, so it can appear within paragraphs.

<dt>Cross references
<dd>The DOCXREF element now has a title attribute, allowing you to
override the generation of the link text.  Also, I've added a
<code/%short-crossrefs%/ parameter to the DSSSL stylesheets (set true
buy default), which allows you to control whether you get short or
long generated text.

<dt>Figure notations
<dd>The set of figure notations has expanded, now including (after
much debate) arbitrary &latex; as an acceptable notation.  At the same
time, the content model for the FIGURE element has changed, so that
each FIGURECONTENT element now specifies a single alternative.

<dt>Assorted bug-fixing
<dd>Includes wrinkles in the DTD as well as in the down-converters.

</dl>

<subsubsect>Outstanding issues

<p>This is the to-do list.  These are the issues which should either
be addressed before the next full release, or postponed as being
unresolvable just now.  For more wishful thinking, see <ref
id=final.development>.

<p>This is more-or-less the same to-do list as in the previous release
(see <ref id=release-0.3> for details).  This release has concentrated
on the issues arising from the last programmers' meeting.

<dl>
<dt>Bundle Jade with the system
<dd>At present, the distribution consists of the SGML kit plus a Jade
distribution.  However, I still haven't managed to get Jade to build
on Suns or Alphas.  This might change, as work has started -- by the
community rather than James Clark alone -- on an open-source version
of Jade called <webref url='http://jade-cvs.avionitek.com/'
>OpenJade</webref>.  This <em/might/ include work on getting Jade to
build on other platforms.

<dt>Use of FPI: should we use <code>-//Starlink//...</code> or
<code>+//IDN star.rl.ac.uk...</code>? 
<dd>I haven't had any comments or thoughts on this.

<dt>Include some facility for dealing with obsolete exported IDs.
<dd>Since I've had no objections to this structure, I'll include DTD
and down-converter support for this anon.

<dt>Development of the programcode DTD
<dd>There was discussion of this at the programmers' meeting, and
there will be developments before the next release.

<dt>Bugs in Jade's LaTeX back-end
<dd>I've since discovered that my identification of these as bugs was
mistaken.  They're features: the character-reference mechanism I
thought was failing was actually the wrong approach, Jade was
correctly barfing on it, and my `fix' was a dirty rotten hack;
unfortunately, Jade doesn't yet seem to support the correct approach,
but OpenJade might soon.

<dt>DTD and down-converter changes forthcoming
<dd>Assorted changes to the programcode DTD were mooted and disputed;
I'll add these.  The HTML down-converter should be extended to process
&latex; code in the `latexgraphics' notation.  Clive suggested the
addition of hours and degrees elements.

<dt>OpenJade
<dd>I'll see if it's sensible to shift to OpenJade away from Clark's
distribution.
