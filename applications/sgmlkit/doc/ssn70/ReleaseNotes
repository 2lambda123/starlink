<subsect id=release-0.6 export>Release Notes, version DR-0.6

<p>This is developers' release 0.6.

<subsubsect>New in this release

<p><ul>

<li>The down-conversion is now driven by a script, <code/sgml2docs/,
as described in <ref id=proc.sgml2docs>.  This required a non-trivial
amount of internal rearrangement, none of which should be visible to
authors.

<li>Significantly upgraded the error handling in the case where a
<code/docxref/ cross-reference target cannot be resolved.  The
stylesheet does not complain in this case, but instead synthesises a
reference to the RAL document server, as long as the public identifier
is in the correct format.  Jade still gives a warning in this case
(which it's not easy to turn off), but it doesn't invalidate the document.

</ul>

<subsubsect>Outstanding issues

<p>There is now a defects list, available on the web at
<url>http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/norman/star/sgml/project/Defects</url>.
