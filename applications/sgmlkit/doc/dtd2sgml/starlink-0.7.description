My thought here was to mirror the BibTeX definitions, and more-or-less
refer folk to the BibTeX manual for details.  That way, we have
complete bibliography support, plus easy implementation.

Ach, coward!

My feeling is that we should keep the functional and presentation
markup separate, so that we have complete control in the
down-conversion about which bits of presentational markup we should
map functional markup to. 

For example, at present the `kbd' element is mapped to the underline
element, as it seems quite important to distinguish that from other
`code' material.  If authors could appropriate the underline element
for that, we wouldn't have the freedom within the down-converter to
use it for something else.  We really have quite a small palette of
target elements -- just `i', `b', `code' and `u', I think (`blink' is
OUT, and `font' is probably dodgy in portability terms).  If we have
more things to express than four, we have to choose which source
elements we can affort not to distinguish, and in any case we don't
have enough to afford letting authors appropriate some of these.

<element gi="entry" status="stable">
<p>A single cell in a table row.  You need not supply all the entries
for a row.  If an <elemref gi="entry"/> element supplies the `colname'

entry is taken to have the column number corresponding to that
<elemref gi="colspec"/>.  If you wish an entry to span more than one
column, then supply both the `namest' and `nameend' attributes.  It is
an error if the `colname' or `namest' attributes are inconsistent with

<element gi="figure" status="stable">
<p>A figure.  The content of the figure, in the <elemref gi="figurecontent"/> elements, may be text or an image of some sort.  The
application will generate a figure number, and attach it to the figure
caption supplied.</p>
<p>You specify the content of the figure by providing zero or more
<elemref gi="figurecontent"/> elements, possibly followed by a single
block of paragraphs of text.  These are <em>alternatives</em>, so they
might indicate the same figure as a EPS file and as a GIF.  Because
not all formats are appropriate to all media, it is up to the
formatting application to select one of these alternatives and use
that as the effective content of the figure.</p>
<p>Note that there are no formats which a formatter is <em>required</em>
to recognise, so it is worthwhile providing a respectable spread of
formats.  Also there is at least one format (MetaPost) which
<em>no</em> formatter presently recognises.  Even in this case, it is
worthwhile including a reference to such a `source' format, since the
declaration will help keep the source for a figure associated with its
result.  If there are other formats you think should be declared here,
please do suggest them.</p>
<p>For an example, see the documentation for the <elemref gi="figurecontent"/> element.</p>
<attribute name="id">
<p>An ID which may be used to refer to this figure in references.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="export">
<p>If the export attribute is present, then it will be permitted for
the ID to be referred to from outside this document.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="float">
<p>If the float attribute is present and has value `float', then the
table may be moved to a more suitable place in the document, if this
would help to avoid an ugly pagebreak, for example.  If the
attribute is missing or has the value `nofloat', then it is pinned to
its current location.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="alt">
<p>An alternative text for the content, displayed if the figure
content cannot be shown.  This is extremely useful in an
online presentation of an image, if the final reader of the text
cannot, or will not, use images.
</p>
</attribute>
<!--splice:figure-->
</element>


<element gi="figurecontent" status="stable">
<p>This is one of, possibly, several alternative formats for a
figure.  When a <elemref gi="figure"/> element is being processed, the
application examines the declared <elemref gi="figurecontent" self="self"/>
elements and any trailing block of text, and selects whichever one it
can best display.</p>
<p>There are several `notations' for figure contents.  Binary formats,
such as GIFs, must be kept in separate files and simply referred to
here.  Text formats, such as LaTeX pictures or MetaPost diagrams, can
either be kept in separate files, or included within the body of the
<elemref gi="figurecontent" self="self"/> element.</p>
<p>The currently allowable notations are <code>eps</code>, <code>jpeg</code> and
<code>gif89a</code> with obvious meanings, <code>metapost</code>, meaning a
graphics description using the MetaPost language and
<code>latexgraphics</code>.</p>
<p>The last one refers to any LaTeX notation for
indicating graphics.  The obvious example is a LaTeX <code>picture</code>
environment, but one can envisage using a LaTeX tabular environment to
represent some figure.  This mechanism is deliberately loosely
specified, and therefore somewhat abusable.  Do please try to resist
inflicting a maintenance nightmare on your successors.
<example>&lt;!DOCTYPE sun PUBLIC "-//Starlink//DTD Starlink SUN//EN" [
  &lt;!ENTITY fig-eps SYSTEM 'figure1.eps' NDATA eps&gt;
  &lt;!ENTITY fig-gif SYSTEM 'figure1.gif' NDATA gif89a&gt;
]&gt;
...
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Figure caption&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;px&gt;Here is a figure with some text in it&lt;/px&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Another figure&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;figurecontent image=fig-eps&gt;
&lt;figurecontent image=fig-gif&gt;
&lt;figurecontent notation=latexgraphics&gt;
\begin{picture}
...
\end{picture}
&lt;/figurecontent&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</example>
</p>
<p>In this example, there is a text-only figure, followed by another
figure.  The second figure includes an image.  The declaration subset
declares two entities, one with `notation' <code>eps</code> (indicating that the
object <code>figure1.eps</code> is an encapsulated postscript file), and one
with notation <code>gif89a</code> (indicating that <code>figure1.gif</code> is a
GIF image.</p>
<p>The third possibility is a snatch of text in the
`latexgraphics' notation.</p>
<p>The processing application will select the most suitable
image, based on these notations.  For example, an application
which uses LaTeX to produce printable text will likely choose the
`latexgraphics' alternative, and an
application formatting text for on-line delivery will likely choose
the GIF image.
</p>
<p>The currently recognised figure notations are as follows:
</p>
<p>
<code>jpeg</code>, <code>gif89a</code>, <code>eps</code>:
The usual JPEG, GIF and encapsulated postscript formats.
</p>
<p>
<code>metapost</code>:
Metapost source code.  This is a text-based drawing package.  That
sounds odd, but it is in fact very flexible, and useful for drawing
certain types of diagrams.  It's described in detail on the
<webref url="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html">MetaPost home page</webref>.
</p>
<p>
<code>latexgraphics</code>:
This is a flexible notation, which refers to any LaTeX code you
case to use to produce a figure.  Most typically, this will be a
<code>picture</code> environment, but it might also be some sort of table,
for example.
</p>
<p>The last two are text formats, and can be
provided inline as the content of the element.
</p>
<p>Note that all of these figure notations are <em>lowercase</em>.

</p>
<attribute name="image">
<p>An entity, giving alternative formats for the image to be
displayed.  The entity must have been declared in the document declaration
subset, with an appropriate notation.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="notation">
<p>The notation of the element content.  Since any entity specified
with the `image' attribute will have an associated notation in the
entity declaration, this attribute is redundant if the `image'
attribute is present.  If they are both present, the notations should
not conflict.</p>
<p>If the `image' attribute is not present, then the element must have
content, and this attribute indicates its notation.  The application
should signal an error if neither attribute is present.

<element gi="foreign" status="stable">
<p>This element indicates that the words it encloses are in a foreign

<element gi="history" status="beta">
<p>This element records the history of the document.  It is 
available in most of the Starlink DTDs, but not all, and when it is
omitted, the <elemref gi="docdate"/> element is required instead.
</p>
<p>The history of a document is composed of a sequence of versions,
changes, and distributions.  A document has a version number of the
form <code>docnumber.docversion-release</code>.  The document number is the
number declared in the <elemref gi="docnumber"/> element, as assigned by
the Starlink librarian.  The document version indicates which edit
of the document this is -- a significant update to the document should
be marked by incrementing the document version number.  The release
information marks a more minor update to a document.
</p>
<p>Each of the three elements has paragraph content, to record brief notes
about the change or distribution.
</p>
<p>A version of a document (marked by a <elemref gi="version"/> element
in the history) is a significant release of a document, perhaps
describing new functionality in a package.  The number attribute gives
the version number to be attached to the document.  You would normally
set the version number to be one greater than the previous version.
</p>
<p>A distribution of a document (marked by a <elemref gi="distribution"/>
element in the history) is a less significant update to a document,
perhaps for distribution to readers for comments.  The <code>string</code>
attribute is a label for the distribution, and could be something like
`draft1' or `comments-13'.
</p>
<p>Other changes to the document are labelled by a <elemref gi="change"/>
element.  These record an edit of a document without a corresponding
change to an version number.  I anticipate that the <elemref gi="change"/> element could actually cover a range of edits to a
document: for example the assorted changes made, perhaps over a period
of some weeks, after a beta-release of the document or any associated
software.
</p>
<p>The <elemref gi="distribution"/> and <elemref gi="change"/> elements have
an optional <code>versionid</code> attribute.  This allows you to specify a
label for this edit.  Throughout the rest of the document, you might
insert <elemref gi="update"/> elements to comment or document a change or
insertion.  These elements have a required <code>versionid</code> attribute
which allows them to refer to a distribution or change element, and
inherit their date and author from them.  These updates can be
collected together at the end of a document, and serve as a `what's
new' section for readers of the updated document.
<example>&lt;author id=ng&gt;Norman

&lt;author id=mb&gt;Martin

&lt;history&gt;
&lt;version author=ng date='02-MAR-1999' number=0&gt;Initial version

<body>
Have we any ideas what to do with math content for help downconverters
(or any other downconverters to non-graphical output)?
A latex -> eqn (eqn is a roff preprocessor) converter would be a good start, 
though it obviously couldn't cope with everything; however a quick 
search doesn't reveal that any such thing exists.  

As things stand the only robust alternative I can see is spitting out the
latex content, but this is not very friendly to help file readers.

Maybe we need a mechanism which can contain an alternative 
ascii-art representation of the latex-notation content.  
This probably needs to be an optional, verbatim-like, element rather 
than an attribute since it may need line breaks to make sense.
In practice, as far as I can see, this is only going to
be a problem for programcode not main document text, since only 
programcode gets converted to an ascii-like format (unless we envisage
people reading SUNs with lynx??).  But if we make a modification,
it's probably best to programcode and main DTDs alike.

Or is this something we've come up with a solution for already and I've
just forgotten?

part of its content, while &lt;KBD> has &lt;WEBREF> as part of its
content. I can see that one might want to use them either way around,
but presumably you wouldn't want to nest them recursively. Quite how
that maps on to XSL I haven't bothered to work out yet. Whatever
behaviour we decide we want should be documented before I tackle that
challenge.

This is indeed a bit of an anomaly.  Originally, code and kbd had only
plain data (#PCDATA) content, and the verbatim element had only `simple
phrase' elements (#PCDATA | em | strong | quote | code | kbd | cite |
m | angle | foreign).  Then I explicitly added the references elements
(ref | docxref | webref | url ) to them both, so that you could make links
between example text in a document and its documentation.  For example:
`Now type &lt;kbd>% &lt;ref id=cmd.sect text='cmd'> argument&lt;/kbd>'.

The latter seems very useful, and though it's an anomaly that you can
have kbd inside webref inside kbd, I'm inclined to leave it, as I don't
see it causing too many problems.
