<element gi="angle" status="beta">
<p>Allows you to specify an astronomical angle, either in degrees or
as an hour angle.  All the attributes are (syntactically) individually
omissable: the system does not perform any check that the
supplied value is reasonable.
<example>&lt;angle angle=45 minutes=30 seconds=10 fraction=0/&gt; is an angle in
degrees (the default), and &lt;angle unit=hours angle=6 minutes=45/&gt; is
an angle in hours, with the number of seconds and fractions of seconds
omitted.  An angle like &lt;angle angle=1000 fraction=10/&gt; is
syntactically acceptable, but astronomical nonsense.</example>

<p>The appendices element contains the
appendices, with one <elemref gi="sect"/> for each appendix. These may be
preceded by an optional <elemref gi="routinelist"/>, if the specific
Starlink document type allows that element.  Note that material such
as bibliography and indexes is in a separate <elemref gi="backmatter"/>

<element gi="cite" status="stable">
<p>Refer to a book or article, for example, by name.

<element gi="code" status="stable">
<p>Include `computer text'.  This does not do any escaping of the

the SGML parser, then they should be escaped either with an entity
reference (that is, using an ampersand) or included in a cdata marked

</p>
<p>Text which a user is to type should be marked up with the <elemref gi="kbd"/> element, and larger blocks of text should be marked up with

<attribute name="type">
<p>This allows you to indicate what type of text is being described
here, and can be used by the processing system as a formatting hint or

as a hint to allow different hyphenation rules to break a long string
appropriately).

<element gi="codecollection" status="beta">
<p>This element makes the link between the documentation and a
collection of code documentation.  The document which this points to
must be marked up in a DTD which is a client of the programcode
architecture.  This will most typically be the `fortrancode' DTD, so
that the source code file will be the program source code.  It could
also, however be a document which is an instance of the `programcode'
DTD, which you have generated by some scripting magic.
</p>
<p>For an example of use, see the documentation for the <elemref
gi='coderef'/> element.</p>
<p>See also the section `Documenting source code' above, in the general
documentation for the SGML Kit.</p>

this ID to refer to elements within this codecollection, when you use
a <elemref gi="coderef"/> element.</p>

<element gi="coderef" status="alpha">
<p>This element makes a link to a routine referred to within a
<elemref gi="codecollection"/> element.  That element makes a
reference to a document which is marked up using the programcode DTD.

...
<p>Here is some text.  It refers to 
<coderef collection=cc1 id=tryxxx>the tryxxx function</coderef>.
We could also refer to this, in this case, as the function
<coderef id=tryxxx/>.

<sect id=two export>Routines
<routinelist>
<codecollection doc="testprog" id=cc1>
]]></example>
The <elemref self="self" gi='coderef'/> element refers to an ID attached
to an element in the programcode document (which will be either a
routine or a routinename element).</p>

<p>Like the <elemref gi="ref"/> element, if you do not supply any content for
this element -- that is, you give the element as <code>&lt;coderef
collection="cc1" id="tryxxx"/></code> -- then the target function's
name will be used as the text.</p>

<attribute name="collection">
<p>The ID which you have assigned to a <elemref
gi="codecollection"/>.  If omitted, the <elemref gi="coderef"
self="self"/> element is taken to refer to the first <elemref
gi='codecollection'/> element in the document, which is useful if there
is only one such element in a simple document.</p>

<element gi="colspec" status="stable">
<p>The colspec element controls the default layout of a column in a table.

the default for individual <elemref gi="entry"/> elements.
</p>
<p>You do not have to have a <elemref gi="colspec" self="self"/> element for
each column in the table.  If all of the columns in a table are to be
left-aligned except the third one, say, then you would specify left
alignment in the <elemref gi="tgroup"/> start-tag, and give a <elemref gi="colspec" self="self"/> element like <code>&lt;colspec colnum=3

</p>
<attribute name="align">

a column by name in a `colname' or `namest' attribute.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="colnum">
<p>This column's number.  If this is omitted, the column's number is
taken to be one greater than the previous column, with the first

<element gi="dl" status="stable">
<p>A description list, consisting of a number of pairs of a
`description term', <elemref gi="dt"/>, and `description data', <elemref gi="dd"/>. Notionally, the <elemref gi="dd"/> is the definition of a term
introduced by the <elemref gi="dt"/>, but the construction can
legitimately be used a little more widely than this.</p>
<attribute name="compact">

<element gi="docxref" status="experimental">
<p>Make a cross-reference to another Starlink document.
<example>&lt;!DOCTYPE sun PUBLIC "-//Starlink//DTD Starlink SUN//EN" [
  &lt;!ENTITY otherdoc PUBLIC "-//Starlink//DOCUMENT Summary SUN/123//EN" SUBDOC&gt;
]&gt;
...
&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;docxref doc=otherdoc /&gt;, particularly
the &lt;docxref doc=otherdoc loc=vimport&gt;warning&lt;/docxref&gt;
notes there.</example>
</p>

<p>Exactly as with the <elemref gi='ref'/> element, you can give the
element no content, in which case the generated text will be of
the form `SUN/XXX', or `SUN/XXX: section nnn'.  That is, the generated
texts should be grammatically consistent with each other.  Note,
however, that this mechanism for generating text is intended to be a
shorthand, with pretensions to no more than being correct <em>most</em> of
the time; sometimes you will need to help it out.</p>

<p>This element is <em>designed</em> to work with summary documents,
which express the structure of the target document, and list the valid
potential targets; this design means that you can't accidentally refer
to a document, or a section, which doesn't exist, only to have your
links break later.  There is a maintenance problem, however, in
distributing accurate document summaries, which has been deemed
awkward enough that no such summaries are being distributed in the
initial version of the Starlink SGML kit.</p>

<p>Instead, you can simply rely on the kit's fallback method of
determining links for <elemref self='self' gi='docxref'/> elements.
If the public identifier supplied to the element is of the form of the
example above, so that the last word in the `description' part of the
public identifier is of the form <code>XXX/NNN</code> (for example,
<code>SUN/123</code>), then the document will make a link to the
corresponding document at the central <webref
url="http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/docscode.html" >Starlink document
server</webref>.  If you also supply a `loc' attribute, the system
will add that to the end of the generated URL.</p>

<p>If you want to make linking within your document more robust, you
can generate document summaries yourself.  Try experimenting with the
script in <code>$STARLINK_SGML_DIR/lib/htx2summ.pl</code>
to convert a current LaTeX-based Starlink document, and its HTX files,
into a document summary file.  This should become easier, or even
automatic, in future.</p>

<attribute name="doc">
<p>Indicates the document we wish to link to.  The value of this
attribute is an entity (declared in the document declaration subset),
which references another document.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="loc">
<p>Indicates a location within a document.  The value of the loc
attribute is an ID reference within the target document.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="text">
<p>At one time, the link text could be specified via the `text'
attribute.  This is now strongly deprecated in favour of specifying it
via docxref element content, and this attribute is likely to disappear
without further warning.</p>

<element gi="entry" status="stable">
<p>A single cell in a table row.  You need not supply all the entries
for a row.  If an <elemref gi="entry"/> element supplies the `colname'
or `namest' attributes, then that attribute refers to a <elemref gi="colspec"/> element in the same <elemref gi="tgroup"/>, and this
entry is taken to have the column number corresponding to that
<elemref gi="colspec"/>.  If you wish an entry to span more than one
column, then supply both the `namest' and `nameend' attributes.  It is
an error if the `colname' or `namest' attributes are inconsistent with
the number of <elemref gi="entry"/> elements actually supplied.

<element gi="figure" status="stable">
<p>A figure.  The content of the figure, in the <elemref gi="figurecontent"/> elements, may be text or an image of some sort.  The
application will generate a figure number, and attach it to the figure
caption supplied.</p>
<p>You specify the content of the figure by providing zero or more
<elemref gi="figurecontent"/> elements, possibly followed by a single
block of paragraphs of text.  These are <em>alternatives</em>, so they
might indicate the same figure as a EPS file and as a GIF.  Because
not all formats are appropriate to all media, it is up to the
formatting application to select one of these alternatives and use
that as the effective content of the figure.</p>
<p>Note that there are no formats which a formatter is <em>required</em>
to recognise, so it is worthwhile providing a respectable spread of
formats.  Also there is at least one format (MetaPost) which
<em>no</em> formatter presently recognises.  Even in this case, it is
worthwhile including a reference to such a `source' format, since the
declaration will help keep the source for a figure associated with its
result.  If there are other formats you think should be declared here,
please do suggest them.</p>
<p>For an example, see the documentation for the <elemref gi="figurecontent"/> element.</p>
<attribute name="id">
<p>An ID which may be used to refer to this figure in references.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="export">
<p>If the export attribute is present, then it will be permitted for
the ID to be referred to from outside this document.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="float">
<p>If the float attribute is present and has value `float', then the
table may be moved to a more suitable place in the document, if this
would help to avoid an ugly pagebreak, for example.  If the
attribute is missing or has the value `nofloat', then it is pinned to
its current location.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="alt">
<p>An alternative text for the content, displayed if the figure
content cannot be shown.  This is extremely useful in an
online presentation of an image, if the final reader of the text
cannot, or will not, use images.
</p>
</attribute>
</element>


<element gi="figurecontent" status="stable">
<p>This is one of, possibly, several alternative formats for a
figure.  When a <elemref gi="figure"/> element is being processed, the
application examines the declared <elemref gi="figurecontent" self="self"/>
elements and any trailing block of text, and selects whichever one it
can best display.</p>
<p>There are several `notations' for figure contents.  Binary formats,
such as GIFs, must be kept in separate files and simply referred to
here.  Text formats, such as LaTeX pictures or MetaPost diagrams, can
either be kept in separate files, or included within the body of the
<elemref gi="figurecontent" self="self"/> element.</p>
<p>The currently allowable notations are <code>eps</code>, <code>jpeg</code> and
<code>gif89a</code> with obvious meanings, <code>metapost</code>, meaning a
graphics description using the MetaPost language and
<code>latexgraphics</code>.</p>
<p>The last one refers to any LaTeX notation for
indicating graphics.  The obvious example is a LaTeX <code>picture</code>
environment, but one can envisage using a LaTeX tabular environment to
represent some figure.  This mechanism is deliberately loosely
specified, and therefore somewhat abusable.  Do please try to resist
inflicting a maintenance nightmare on your successors.
<example>&lt;!DOCTYPE sun PUBLIC "-//Starlink//DTD Starlink SUN//EN" [
  &lt;!ENTITY fig-eps SYSTEM 'figure1.eps' NDATA eps&gt;
  &lt;!ENTITY fig-gif SYSTEM 'figure1.gif' NDATA gif89a&gt;
]&gt;
...
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Figure caption&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;px&gt;Here is a figure with some text in it&lt;/px&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Another figure&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;figurecontent image=fig-eps&gt;
&lt;figurecontent image=fig-gif&gt;
&lt;figurecontent notation=latexgraphics&gt;
\begin{picture}
...
\end{picture}
&lt;/figurecontent&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</example>
</p>
<p>In this example, there is a text-only figure, followed by another
figure.  The second figure includes an image.  The declaration subset
declares two entities, one with `notation' <code>eps</code> (indicating that the
object <code>figure1.eps</code> is an encapsulated postscript file), and one
with notation <code>gif89a</code> (indicating that <code>figure1.gif</code> is a
GIF image.</p>
<p>The third possibility is a snatch of text in the
`latexgraphics' notation.</p>
<p>The processing application will select the most suitable
image, based on these notations.  For example, an application
which uses LaTeX to produce printable text will likely choose the
`latexgraphics' alternative, and an
application formatting text for on-line delivery will likely choose
the GIF image.
</p>
<p>The currently recognised figure notations are as follows:
</p>
<p>
<code>jpeg</code>, <code>gif89a</code>, <code>eps</code>:
The usual JPEG, GIF and encapsulated postscript formats.
</p>
<p>
<code>metapost</code>:
Metapost source code.  This is a text-based drawing package.  That
sounds odd, but it is in fact very flexible, and useful for drawing
certain types of diagrams.  It's described in detail on the
<webref url="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html">MetaPost home page</webref>.
</p>
<p>
<code>latexgraphics</code>:
This is a flexible notation, which refers to any LaTeX code you
case to use to produce a figure.  Most typically, this will be a
<code>picture</code> environment, but it might also be some sort of table,
for example.
</p>
<p>The last two are text formats, and can be
provided inline as the content of the element.
</p>
<p>Note that all of these figure notations are <em>lowercase</em>.

</p>
<attribute name="image">
<p>An entity, giving alternative formats for the image to be
displayed.  The entity must have been declared in the document declaration
subset, with an appropriate notation.</p>
</attribute>
<attribute name="notation">
<p>The notation of the element content.  Since any entity specified
with the `image' attribute will have an associated notation in the
entity declaration, this attribute is redundant if the `image'
attribute is present.  If they are both present, the notations should
not conflict.</p>
<p>If the `image' attribute is not present, then the element must have
content, and this attribute indicates its notation.  The application
should signal an error if neither attribute is present.
</p>
</attribute>
</element>


<element gi="foreign" status="stable">
<p>This element indicates that the words it encloses are in a foreign
language.  For example, you might write <code>&lt;foreign&gt;et
al.&lt;/foreign&gt;</code>.  This is different from putting them in an
<elemref gi="em"/> element; whereas emphasises words might be shown as
such by being put in bold rather than italicised, foreign words should
always be italicised.
</p>
</element>


<element gi="history" status="beta">
<p>This element records the history of the document.  It is 
available in most of the Starlink DTDs, but not all, and when it is
omitted, the <elemref gi="docdate"/> element is required instead.
</p>
<p>The history of a document is composed of a sequence of versions,
changes, and distributions.  A document has a version number of the
form <code>docnumber.docversion-release</code>.  The document number is the
number declared in the <elemref gi="docnumber"/> element, as assigned by
the Starlink librarian.  The document version indicates which edit
of the document this is -- a significant update to the document should
be marked by incrementing the document version number.  The release
information marks a more minor update to a document.
</p>
<p>Each of the three elements has paragraph content, to record brief notes
about the change or distribution.
</p>
<p>A version of a document (marked by a <elemref gi="version"/> element
in the history) is a significant release of a document, perhaps
describing new functionality in a package.  The number attribute gives
the version number to be attached to the document.  You would normally
set the version number to be one greater than the previous version.
</p>
<p>A distribution of a document (marked by a <elemref gi="distribution"/>
element in the history) is a less significant update to a document,
perhaps for distribution to readers for comments.  The <code>string</code>
attribute is a label for the distribution, and could be something like
`draft1' or `comments-13'.
</p>
<p>Other changes to the document are labelled by a <elemref gi="change"/>
element.  These record an edit of a document without a corresponding
change to an version number.  I anticipate that the <elemref gi="change"/> element could actually cover a range of edits to a
document: for example the assorted changes made, perhaps over a period
of some weeks, after a beta-release of the document or any associated
software.
</p>
<p>The <elemref gi="distribution"/> and <elemref gi="change"/> elements have
an optional <code>versionid</code> attribute.  This allows you to specify a
label for this edit.  Throughout the rest of the document, you might
insert <elemref gi="update"/> elements to comment or document a change or
insertion.  These elements have a required <code>versionid</code> attribute
which allows them to refer to a distribution or change element, and
inherit their date and author from them.  These updates can be
collected together at the end of a document, and serve as a `what's
new' section for readers of the updated document.

<element gi="mapid" status="beta">
<p>Several elements, including the sectioning elements (see <elemref gi="sect"/>), <elemref gi="table"/> and <elemref gi="figure"/>, have an
`export' attribute.  Amongst other things, this expresses a
committment to keep the associated ID valid in future versions of a
document.  Sometimes, however, it is necessary to remove sections, or
change their content in such a way that a reference via their original
ID would be inappropriate.  In this case, you can use the <elemref gi="mapid" self="self"/> element to remap the target of the reference, either to
some other element which is now appropriate, or to some section which
explains that the targeted section has been deleted.</p>
<p>The <elemref gi="mapid" self="self"/> element takes two attributes, the

<element gi="mdefs" status="beta">
<p>This element allows you to make definitions which are global to the

be in effect for all the <elemref gi="m"/>, <elemref gi="mequation"/>,
<elemref gi="meqnarray"/> and <elemref gi="mline"/> elements which
follow it.</p>

<p>In different versions of the down-converters, it may or may not be
true that definitions in one maths element remain valid in later
ones.  Do not rely on this, as it is unsupported behaviour, and may
change without warning.</p>

<p>The contents of this element are processed as arbitrary LaTeX.
However, you should not include anything other than definition
commands and possibly other parameters to do with the layout of maths,
and specifically you should write nothing which creates any output.
Although this element is processed fairly straightforwardly when
generating LaTeX output, the content is moved around quite a lot when
producing HTML output, and hacky fiddling here has the potential to
mess up your document in the present and, what is much worse,
<em>become wrong</em> when processed by a later version of the
down-converter, which <em>will</em> assume you have done nothing hacky

<element gi="px" status="stable">
<p>A restricted paragraph.
</p>
<p>In certain contexts, it is convenient to forbid certain elements from
otherwise-unrestricted paragraph text.  The
<elemref gi="px" self="self"/> element has the same usage as <elemref gi="p"/>, but
with a slightly restricted content model.
</p>
</element>


<element gi="quote" status="stable">
<p>A simple quotation, the in-line companion to the <elemref gi="blockquote"/> element.
</p>
</element>


<element gi="ref" status="alpha">
<p>A reference to another point in the same document.  If the element
has any content, this will be used as the link text, but if it has no
content, the link text will be generated, based on
the link target.
Note, by the way, that the link is to a complete <em>element</em> of the
document, rather than a <em>point</em> of the document.</p>

<p>The list of elements you can use as the target of a reference is
the same as the list of elements which have `id' attributes, and is currently
<elemref gi="abstract"/>,
<elemref gi="sect"/>,
<elemref gi="subsect"/>,
<elemref gi="subsubsect"/>,
<elemref gi="subsubsubsect"/>,
<elemref gi="appendices"/>,
<elemref gi="figure"/>,
<elemref gi="table"/>,
<elemref gi="mlabel"/>,
<elemxref gi="routine" dtd="progdtd"/>,
<elemref gi="dt"/>, and
<elemref gi="li"/>.
You can also refer to <elemref gi="p"/> elements, though in this case
the reference will actually be to the section which contains the
paragraph.  The fact that you can refer to routine elements using this
means only that you can do cross-references <em>within</em>
programcode documents.</p>

<p>When you give the element no content, the generated text will be of
the form `section XXX', or `equation XXX'.  That is, the generated
texts should be grammatically consistent with each other.  Note,
however, that this mechanism for generating text is intended to be a
shorthand, with pretensions to no more than being correct <em>most</em> of
the time; sometimes you will need to help it out.  You may prefer, on
the other hand, to specify the link text (almost) every time; in this
case, I'm sure you don't need me to remind you that link text like
`<code>more details &lt;ref id="somewhere" >here&lt;/ref></code>' is
unlikely to be terrifically useful in a paper version of the
document.</p>

<p>Should you want to include different link text depending on the
target medium, you will have to have more than one <elemref gi="ref"
self="self"/> element, each inside a suitable <elemref gi="span"/>
element.</p>

<p>You cannot link to code prologues using this mechanism.  For that,
see the <elemref gi='coderef'/> element.</p>

<p><example>See also &lt;ref id=other.ref/> for more details.

<element gi="sect" status="stable">
<p>This element <em>contains</em> a section.
</p>
<p>The content of this element starts with a <elemref gi="subhead"/>

two are followed by the section content.  Note, however, that since 
the <elemref gi="subhead"/> and <elemref gi="title"/> start and end tags are
both omissable, you may omit both, and follow the <elemref gi="sect" self="self"/> start tag with the section title.
</p>
<p>That is, the structure is formally
<example>&lt;sect&gt;&lt;subhead&gt;&lt;title&gt;Section title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;subhead&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/sect&gt;</example>

The same is true for the 
<elemref gi="subsect"/>,
<elemref gi="subsubsect"/>, and
<elemref gi="subsubsubsect"/>
elements.
</p>
<p>Note that the <elemref gi="sect" self="self"/> element contains the <elemref gi="subsect"/> element, but not the <elemref gi="subsubsect"/> element -- it
is therefore impossible to break the sectioning structure.
</p>
<attribute name="id">

</attribute>
<attribute name="export">
<p>If this attribute is present, then the SGML application will allow other

presence of this attribute is a commitment to maintain this ID as a
meaningful link target in future versions of this document.
See the <elemref gi="mapid"/> element for a mechanism which allows you to
rename obsolete IDs.</p>
<p>You should include this attribute on all sections and subsections.
This is enforced by the DTD for <elemref gi="sect" self="self"/> and <elemref gi="subsect"/> elements (this can be controlled by the
<code>%Feature.EnforceLinkPolicy</code> switch: see the main documentation
for details).</p>
<p>Note that the DTD and processing system do not <em>default</em> this
attribute to be present, even though it is required and its presence
could be inferred.  They require you to insert it explicitly,
so that you are aware that the ID has been exported, and that it

<element gi="span" status="beta">
<p>This element is intended to delimit properly-nested regions
in the flow of text.  At present, the only attribute it has is
the media attribute, but it might be extended with a
more general `class' attribute at some point.</p>

<p>Note the place of this element in the element hierarchy.  It can
include all the elements which are permitted inside a paragraph, such
as <elemref gi="verbatim"/> or <elemref gi="dl"/> and the like, but it
cannot be included within any of these in-paragraph elements.</p>

<attribute name="media">
<p>This attribute specifies the media type or types for which the
element's content should be included in the output.  If the attribute
is missing, then the element content is included.</p>

<p>If the attribute is specified, than it shall be a list of media
types separated by commas, each of which is optionally followed by a
parameter string, separated from the media type by whitespace.  The
grammar is therefore:
<verbatim>
media-spec-list = media-spec ( ',' media-spec )*
media-spec      =   S* media-type S*
                  | S* media-type S+ parameter-list
media-type      = [A-Za-z0-9-]+
parameter-list  = [^,]+
</verbatim>
(where `<code>S</code>' is whitespace).  At present, the
parameter-list is ignored, and the only media-types recognised
(case-sensitively) are (quoting from the HTML4 spec):
<dl>
<dt><code>screen</code></dt>
<dd>Intended for non-paged computer screens.</dd>
<dt><code>tty</code></dt>
<dd>Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid, such as
teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display
capabilities.</dd>
<dt><code>print</code></dt>
<dd>Intended for paged, opaque material and for documents viewed on
screen in print preview mode.</dd>
<dt><code>all</code></dt>
<dd>Suitable for all devices.</dd>
</dl>
As the Starlink SGML kit exists at present, <code>screen</code> is for
producing HTML, <code>print</code> for producing printed
documentation, and <code>tty</code> for HLP files.
Unrecognised media-types are permitted, but ignored.</p>

<p>The element content is included in the output document if:
<ol>
<li>The media attribute is omitted</li>
<li>The media attribute includes the media-type <code>all</code>.</li>
<li>The media attribute includes a media-type which a particular
down-converter is designed to process.  For example, the HTML
down-converter will process span elements with media-type
<code>screen</code>.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>For example, if a document had a span element of the form
<example>&lt;span media="screen, 3d-glasses, print and resolution > 90dpi"
  >Blah blah blah&lt;span></example>
then this would resolve to the three media types <code>screen</code>,
<code>3d-glasses</code> and <code>print</code>, and the content `Blah
blah blah' would be included by the HTML and print down-converters.</p>
