&dtdsummary;

<element gi='argumentlist'>
<p>The list of arguments/parameters to a function.  Note that this is
different from the <elemref gi='parameterlist'> element, which is the
list of parameters to an ADAM task.

<attribute name='none'>
<p>If this attribute is present, it indicates that the function has no
arguments.  In this case, there should be no <elemref gi=parameter> content.

<element gi='attribution'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='attribution'>

<element gi='author'>
<p>Describes the author of a function.

<p>The <elemref self gi='author'> element includes full details about
an author and has a required ID attribute, the <elemref
gi='authorref'> element simply refers to an <elemref self gi='author'>
element elsewhere using an IDREF.  We need the distinction since it
follows from the fact that the element has a (unique) ID attribute,
that a document can have only one <elemref self gi='author'> element
per author.  If the actual text of a document is scattered amongst
several source-code files, then it would be appropriate for the
scattered files to have <elemref gi='authorref'> elements, and for the
corresponding <elemref self gi='author'> element to be in a <elemref
gi='codegroup'> element in a `master' file which collects together
the source-code files for documentation purposes.

<attribute name='id'>
<p>A unique ID for the author.  This is used within <elemref
gi='authorref'> and <elemref gi=change> elements.

<attribute name='affiliation'>
<p>An optional affiliation for the author.  It contains text such as
`Starlink, University of Glasgow'.

<attribute name='email'>
<p>An email address for the author.

<attribute name='webpage'>
<p>A URL for the author.

<element gi='authorlist'>
<p>Contains the collection of authors who have contributed to a
particular function.  Authors who have indirectly contributed code --
perhaps a package you've based the function on -- can be credited in
the <elemref gi='otherauthors'> element.

<element gi='authornote'>
<p>Optional further information about an author.  This might be
particularly useful when the author is one of those consigned to the
<elemref gi=otherauthors> element.

<p>For example, in the DSSSL code
written for this SGML project, the ISO standard document describing
DSSSL was used to supply various functions which were not implemented
as primitives in the Jade system.  The standard was therefore listed
as an `other author' of some parts of the code, with a note explaining
this in the <elemref self gi=authornote> element.

<element gi='authorref'>
<p>A reference to an author whose details are in the <elemref
gi=author> element referred to by the ID attribute.

<attribute name='id'>
<p>The link to the <elemref gi=author> element.

<attribute name='note'>
<p>A note giving further information about the author, in this
context.  For example, ISO 10179 was listed as an `author' of some of
the routines in the DSSSL stylesheet, and this attribute was used to
list the section of the standard where the code was defined.

<element gi='blockquote'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='blockquote'>

<element gi='bugs'>
<p>A note of any bugs known in this routine.

<element gi='change'>
<p>A description of a change made to the code.

<attribute name='author'>
<p>The ID of the author who made the change, linking to a previous
<elemref gi=author> element.
<attribute name='date'>
<p>The date the change was made.  Format is dd-MMM-yyyy -- a two-digit
day of month, a three-letter abbreviation for the month (uppercase),
and a four-digit year.

<element gi='cite'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='cite'>
<element gi='code'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='code'>

<element gi='codebody'>
<p>The actual code of the function.

<attribute name='empty'>
<p>The <elemref gi=codebody> element is required, buf if there is no
code actually included within the document, so that the element is
empty, then this may be indicated by the presence of this attribute.

<element gi='codegroup'>
<p>A codegroup is a collection of functions or other
code which can sensibly be grouped together.
There's no particular semantics implied by the
grouping, as far as this DTD is (currently)
concerned.

<p>However, the DTDs which include this programcode DTD may add
semantics to this element.  For example, the DSSSL DTD maps this
element to the <code/style-specification/ element in the DSSSL architecture.

<attribute name='language'>
<p>The programming language used by the code within the group.  This
will be set by the DTD which includes this programcode DTD, and you
need not (indeed cannot) set it.

<element gi='codeopener'>
<p>The Traditional way of laying out functions in Starlink source code
is to give the function declaration, then its documentation, and then
the code body.  This element exists to reflect this.  By design, you
will typically not need to give it explicitly.  If you do need to
concern yourself about this (perhaps because you are generating SGML
using a script, then the usage is:
<example>
   &lt;routine>
   &lt;codeopener>
   subroutine try
   &lt;routineprologue>
     &lt;routinename>try
     ...
   &lt;codebody>
   print hello
   return
</example>

<element gi='codereference'>
<p>Make a link to code in another document.  There is no defined
semantics attached to this link in general, but it might be used to
document a dependency between two modules, such as a source code file
depending on an include file.

<p>The document referred to should be marked up using this programcode DTD.

<p>As with the <elemref gi=codegroup> element, the DSSSL DTD adds
semantics to this element.  It maps this element to the
<code/external-specification/ element in the DSSSL architecture.

<attribute name='docid'>
<p>An ID within the target document, if required.

<attribute name='doc'>
<p>A subdoc entity which references the document being linked to.

<element gi='colspec'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='colspec'>

<element gi='copyright'>
<p>A copyright statement attached to the code.

<element gi='description'>
<p>A detailed description of the code to follow.  If this is
extensive, then a brief statement should be included within the
optional <elemref gi=purpose> element.

<element gi='dd'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='dd'>
<element gi='dl'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='dl'>

<element gi='docblock'>
<p>A block of documentation, introducing either a complete document,
or one of the <elemref gi=codegroup> or <elemref gi=codereference> blocks.

<element gi='dt'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='dt'>
<element gi='em'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='em'>
<element gi='entry'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='entry'>

<element gi='example'>
<p>The text of an example.  This is followed by a separate description
element.

<element gi='examplelist'>
<p>A list of examples.

<element gi='funcname'>
<p>Another function name presumably in the same collection of code.
There are no restrictions on what function names you can list here.
The formatting system might, for example, be able to make a link to
the documentation of that function, if it can find it.

<element gi='history'>
<p>The change history for the document or block.  The changes should
be in chronological order, with newest last.

<element gi='implementationstatus'>
<p>A string (I don't actually know of guidelines for what should be in
here).


<element gi='invocation'>
<p>An example of how to invoke the function or task.

<element gi='name'>
<p>The author/function/parameter name, depending on context.

<element gi='ol'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='ol'>

<element gi='otherauthors'>
<p>Other contributors to a package, with a less direct involvement with
it than would be appropriate for inclusion in an <elemref gi=author>
element.

<element gi='othernames'>
<p>Sometimes a function will have a generic form, as well as specific
forms for, for example, single and double precision.  In this case,
the function's generic name can be given in the <elemref
gi=routinename>'s <elemref gi=name> element, and other names for it
can be included as <elemref self gi=othernames>.

<element gi='diytopic'>
<p>A note, which will be displayed in the same format as the other
headings in this context.

<element gi='p'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='p'>

<element gi='parameter'>
<p>A single parameter for a function.
<attribute name='given'>
<p>If the parameter is read by the function, this attribute should be
present.  If neither this, nor the `returned' attribute is present,
the default is taken to be `given'.
<attribute name='returned'>
<p>If the parameter is written by the function, this attribute should
be present.
<!--
<attribute name='direction'>
<p>Indicates whether the parameter is passed in to the function,
set by the function, and so on.  In some languages (such as 
DSSSL), all parameters are read-only, and so the corresponding DTD
might default this.
-->
<attribute name='default'>
<p>The default value, if this parameter is optional and omitted.
<attribute name='optional'>
<p>This attribute is present if the parameter is optional.
Optional means that
the parameter will be defaulted if omitted,
and keyword means that the parameter is
specified with a keyword.  Both mechanisms
are used in both DSSSL and IDL (for
example). 

<element gi='parameterlist'>
<p>The list of parameters to an ADAM task.  Note that this is
different from the <elemref gi='argumentlist'> element, which is the
list of parameters to a function.

<element gi='programcode'>
<p>The top level element

<element gi='purpose'>
<p>A brief description of the function being documented.  If this is
missing, then the contents of the <elemref gi=description> are used
instead, but if that element has a lot of content, then you should
provide a <elemref self gi=purpose> element, to be used in contexts
where only a brief function description is required.

<element gi='px'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='px'>
<element gi='quote'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='quote'>

<p>The return value of a function.  If there is none, then the
attribute none should be present.

<element gi='returnvalue'>
<p>The return value of the function.
<attribute name='none'>
<p>If there is no return value, then supply this attribute.
<attribute name='type'>
<p>A string indicating the type of the return value of the function.

<element gi='routine'>
<p>The documentation for a single routine.  Most of the element
content of this element is optional, so it can be used equally well
to document code which does not have things like parameters,
returnvalues, and the like.

<element gi='routinename'>
<p>The name of the routine being documented.

<element gi='routineprologue'>
<p>This is the header which documents the routine, or other code, to follow.

<element gi='row'>
<p>See <elemref dtd=sundtd gi='row'>

<element gi='softwarekeywords'>
<p>This indicates which software group the software is a member of,
and consists of a single group keyword.  This keyword is primarily
intended for use internally to Starlink, although it may be used by
users to find related software.  The <elemref gi=userkeywords> element
is for user-oriented keywords.

<p>The list of group names and keywords is maintained by the Starlink
Software Librarian.  The current list of categories and their
associated keywords is maintained at
<webref url="http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/software.html">, and
currently consists of the following.

<!-- Is there a source of these keyword-catagory mappings more
authoritative than the generated HTML at the URL above.  Also, is
there a long-term database-query URL I can link these to?  The current
entries in the table link to .../cgi-acc/..., which I assume was
specific to Anne Charles. -->

<element gi='usage'>
<p>An example of the usage of this function (how is this different
from `invocation'?)

<element gi='userkeywords'>
<p>This element lists keywords intended to help a user find
appropriate software.  You can indicate the general area of astronomy
which the software is intended to address, by using the `Monthly
Notices' keyword list (which is common to A&amp;A and ApJ).  You can
find the list in the journal, or on the Monthly Notices web pages.
Separate keywords by semicolons.

<p>Since not all Starlink software will necessarily be directly and
solely related to astronomy, you may extend the keyword at lib., as
long as the keywords you invent are prefixed with `general: ...'.
