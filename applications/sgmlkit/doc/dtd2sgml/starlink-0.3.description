<!-- $Id$ -->

<!-- Fixed attributes not documented -->

<dtddescription docelem=sun>

<element gi='abstract'>
<p>The abstract for the document

<element gi='appendices'> 

<p>The appendices element contains the
appendices, with one <elemref gi=sect> for each appendix. These may be
preceded by an optional <elemref gi=routinelist>, if the specific
Starlink document type allows that element.  Note that material such
as bibliography and indexes is in a separate <elemref gi=backmatter>
element, and not an appendix.

<element gi='attribution'>
<p>The source of a quotation, either as free text or a <elemref
gi=citation> element.

<element gi='author'>
<p>An author/editor of the current document.

<attribute name='affiliation'>
<p>The `home institution' of an author, such as `Starlink, University
of Glasgow'.

<attribute name='email'>
<p>An email address for the author.

<attribute name='id'>
<p>An ID which may be used to refer to the author from within a
<elemref gi=history> element, for example.

<attribute name='role'>
<p>The role this individual has played in the maintenance of this
document, if it's different from the straightforward `author'.  For
example, this might be `maintainer', `original version', and so on.

<attribute name='webpage'>
<p>A home page for the author, which might contain further contact details.

<element gi='authorlist'>
<p>The list of authors and editors who have contributed to a
document.  If a document is passed on from one person to another, it
might be appropriate for the original author to retain a credit for
the document, by being listed as one of the <elemref gi=otherauthors>.

<element gi='backmatter'>
<p>Bundles together the various backmatter elements.

<attribute name='bibliography'>
<p>Names the bibliography which is to be searched for entries.
<p>The transformation of this name into an actual bibliography file is
in principle up to the application which processes the SGML file.  In
the current application, however, this attribute names a BibTeX
bib-file (without the .bib extension).

<!--
Bibliography element removed, replaced with backmatter/bibliography attribute
<element gi='bibliography'>
<p>If this element is present within the <elemref gi=backmatter>
element, then a 
bibliography will be included in the document.  The application will
generate the bibliography itself -- it is not included within this
element, which is empty.  

<p>Bibliographic entries are included in the bibliography if they were
referred to in the document using the <elemref gi=citation> element.

<attribute name='all'>
<p>If this attribute is present, then the complete bibliography will
be included, rather than just those entries which were referred to by
a <elemref gi=citation> element.
-->

<element gi='blockquote'>
<p>A substantial quotation which will typically (but not, of course,
necessarily) be set off from the text around it.

<element gi='caption'>
<p>Caption of a <elemref gi=figure> or <elemref gi=table>.

<element gi='change'>
<p>Records a change.  See <elemref gi=history>.
<attribute name='date'>
<p>The date this distribution was
made. Format: dd-MMM-yyyy.
<attribute name='author'>
<p>Whom the release is attributable to.  This
links to one of the author elements.   If this attribute is omitted,
it defaults to the content of the author attribute of the previous
<elemref self gi='distribution'> element.
<attribute name='versionid'>
<p>An id to allow UPDATE elements to refer to a
specific version.  It can be anything, but a
sensible format is v10-5, for example (it can't
start with a number)


<element gi='citation'>
<p>Refers to an entry in the <elemref gi=bibliography> associated with
this document.  In the current application, the content is interpreted
as the key to an entry in a BibTeX database.
<attribute name='noref'>
<p>If this attribute is present, then the application should include a
reference to this citation in the bibliography, but without 
actually referring to the entry at this position in the text.

<element gi='cite'>
<p>Refer to a book or article, for example, by name.

<element gi='code'>
<p>Include `computer text'.  This does not do any escaping of the
enclosed text: if there are any characters which might be special to
the SGML parser, then they should be escaped either with an entity
reference (that is, using an ampersand) or included in a cdata marked
section.

<p>Text which a user is to type should be marked up with the <elemref
gi=kbd> element, and larger blocks of text should be marked up with
<elemref gi=verbatim>.

<attribute name='type'>
<p>This allows you to indicate what type of text is being described
here, and can be used by the processing system as a formatting hint or
for some other purpose.  The only current value is `fspath', for
`filesystem path' (the current LaTeX formatter uses this as a hint to
allow different hyphenation rules to break a long string appropriately).

<element gi='codecollection'>
<p>This element makes the link between the documentation and a
collection of code documentation.  The document which this points to
must be marked up in a DTD which is a client of the programcode
architecture.  This will typically, but not necessarily, be a suitable
source code file.

<p>See the documentation which covers this topic for further details.
<attribute name='doc'>
<p>A document which is marked up in a DTD which is a client of the
Starlink programcode architecture.
<attribute name='ids'>
<p>If present, this lists the elements within the target document
which should be processed (not currently implemented).

<element gi='colspec'>
<p>The colspec element controls the layout of a column in a table (not
implemented).

<element gi='copyright'>
<p>Specifies a copyright declaration for the document.

<element gi='dd'>
<p>`Description data' in a description list.

<element gi='distribution'>
<p>Records the distribution of a version of the document, or some
other freezing of it.  The content is free-text
notes on the distribution or the packaging.  See the description of
<elemref gi=history> for an overview of the history element.
<attribute name='string'>
<p>Identifies the distribution.  This will
typically be something like '1' or '2', but
could be 'draft' or something
descriptive.  It should be a single word.
<attribute name='date'>
<p>The date this distribution was
made. Format: dd-MMM-yyyy.
<attribute name='author'>
<p>Whom the release is attributable to.  This
links to one of the author elements.   If this attribute is omitted,
it defaults to the content of the author attribute of the previous
<elemref self gi='distribution'> element.
<attribute name='versionid'>
<p>An id to allow UPDATE elements to refer to a
specific version.  It can be anything, but a
sensible format is v10-5, for example (it can't
start with a number)

<element gi='dl'>
<p>A description list, consisting of a number of pairs of a
`description term', <elemref gi=dt>, and `description data', <elemref
gi=dd>. Notionally, the <elemref gi=dd> is the definition of a term
introduced by the <elemref gi=dt>, but the construction can
legitimately be used a little more widely than this.

<element gi='docbody'>
<p>The document body, containing all the printable text of the document.

<element gi='docdate'>
<p>The document date.  The format is `dd-MMM-yyyy' -- a two-digit day
of the month, the month as three uppercase letters (`JAN', `FEB', and
so on), and a four-digit year.
<p>This element will appear in the <elemref gi=docinfo> element of
those DTDs which do not have a <elemref gi=history> element.

<element gi='docinfo'>
<p>The document metadata.

<element gi='docnumber'>
<p>The document number, as assigned by the Starlink librarian.
<example>&lt;docnumber&gt;123</example>
<example>&lt;docnumber unassigned&gt;</example>
<attribute name='unassigned'>
<p>If this attribute is present, then it records that the document
number has not (yet?) been assigned by the Starlink librarian.

<element gi='docxref'>
<p>Make a cross-reference to another Starlink document.
<example><![ cdata [
<!doctype sun public "-//Starlink//DTD Starlink SUN//EN" [
  <!entity otherdoc public "-//Starlink//DOCUMENT Summary SUN/123//EN" subdoc>
]>
...
<p>See also <docxref doc=otherdoc>
]]></example>

<attribute name='doc'>
<p>Indicates the document we wish to link to.  The value of this
attribute is an entity (declared in the document declaration subset),
which references another document.
<attribute name='loc'>
<p>Indicates a location within a document.  The value of the loc
attribute is an ID reference within the target document.
<!--
<attribute name='text'>
<p>If present, the attribute's data is used to form the link text,
rather than generating it based on the target.
-->

<element gi='draftnote'>
<p>A note to be included in the text of the document.  It'll be
formatted so that it stands out in some way.

<element gi='dt'>
<p>The `definition term' in a <elemref gi=dl> element.

<element gi='editors'>
<p>The list of people who have made adjustments to the document, which
don't really count as authoring contributions.

<element gi='em'>
<p>Emphasised text.

<element gi='entry'>
<p>A single cell in a table row.

<element gi='figure'>
<p>A figure.  The content of the figure, in the <elemref
gi=figurecontent> element, may be text or an image of some sort..  The
application will generate a figure number, and attach it to the figure
caption supplied.
<attribute name='id'>
<p>An ID which may be used to refer to this figure in references.
<attribute name='export'>
<p>If the export attribute is present, then it will be permitted for
the ID to be referred to from outside this document.
<attribute name='float'>
<p>If the float attribute is present and has value `float', then the
table may be moved to a more suitable place in the document, if this
would help to avoid an ugly pagebreak, for example.  If the
attribute is missing or has the value `nofloat', then it is pinned to
its current location.

<element gi='figurecontent'>
<p>The actual content of the figure.  This may be paragraphs of text.
If the image attribute is present, then the element is taken to be
empty, and the entities referred to by that attribute are used for the
figure content.
<example><![ cdata [
<!doctype sun public "-//Starlink//DTD Starlink SUN//EN" [
  <!entity fig-eps system 'figure1.eps' ndata eps>
  <!entity fig-gif system 'figure1.gif' ndata gif87a>
]>
...
<figure>
<caption>Figure caption</caption>
<figurecontent alt=''>Here is a figure with some text in
  it</figurecontent>
</figure>
<figure>
<caption>Another figure</caption>
<figurecontent alt='An interesting image' image='fig-eps fig-gif'>
</figure>
]]></example>
<p>In this example, there is a text-only figure, followed by another
figure.  The second figure includes an image.  The declaration subset
declares two entities, one with `notation' <code/eps/ (indicating that the
object <code/figure1.eps/ is an encapsulated postscript file), and one
with notation <code/gif87a/ (indicating that <code/figure1.gif/ is a
GIF image.  The processing application will select the most suitable
image, based on these notations.  For example, an application
producing text to be printed will likely choose the EPS file, and an
application formatting text for on-line delivery will likely choose
the GIF iamge.

<attribute name='alt'>
<p>An alternative text for the content, displayed if the figure
content cannot be shown.  This is redundant (but still formally
required) if the figure content is text, but extremely useful in an
online presentation of an image, if the final reader of the text has
not loaded images.
<attribute name='image'>
<p>A list of entities, giving alternative formats for the image to be
displayed.  The entities must be declared in the document declaration
subset, with appropriate notations. 
<p>The currently available image notations are `jpeg', `eps' and `gif87a'.
<p>If this attribute is present, the content of the element (in the
SGML sense, meaning the list of <elemref gi=px> elements) is ignored.


<element gi='history'>
<p>This element records the history of the document.  It is 
available in most of the Starlink DTDs, but not all, and when it is
omitted, the <elemref gi=docdate> element is required instead.

<p>The history of a document is composed of a sequence of versions,
changes, and distributions.  A document has a version number of the
form <code/docnumber.docversion-release/.  The document number is the
number declared in the <elemref gi=docnumber> element, as assigned by
the Starlink librarian.  The document version indicates which edit
of the document this is -- a significant update to the document should
be marked by incrementing the document version number.  The release
information marks a more minor update to a document.

<p>Each of the three elements has paragraph content, to record brief notes
about the change or distribution.

<p>A version of a document (marked by a <elemref gi=version> element
in the history) is a significant release of a document, perhaps
describing new functionality in a package.  The number attribute gives
the version number to be attached to the document.

<p>A distribution of a document (marked by a <elemref gi=distribution>
element in the history) is a less significant update to a document,
perhaps for distribution to readers for comments.  The <code/string/
attribute is a label for the distribution, and could be something like
`draft1' or `comments-13'.

<p>Other changes to the document are labelled by a <elemref gi=change>
element.  These record an edit of a document without a corresponding
change to an version number.

<p>The <elemref gi=distribution> and <elemref gi=change> elements have
an optional <code/versionid/ attribute.  This allows you to specify a
label for this edit.  Any <elemref gi=update> elements elsewhere in
the text must attach themselves to one of these elements, using the
<code/versionid/ attribute.
<example><![ cdata [
<author id=ng>Norman
<editors>
<author id=mb>Martin
...
<history>
<version author=ng date='02-MAR-1999' number=0>Initial version
<distribution author=ng date='03-MAR-1999' string='comments1'>Released
  to programmers for comment.
<change author=ng date='04-MAR-1999' versionid=alt99>Various tidyings
<version author=mb date='05-MAR-1999' number=1>First public release
...
<p><update author=ng versionid=alt99>Corrected typos and reexpressed
argument</update>In this section....
]]></example>

<element gi='index'>
<p>The contents of the element are to be indexed.
<attribute name='key'>
<p>If this attribute is present, then the attribute value is used as
the index key, rather than the element contents.

<!--
<element gi='indexcontents'>
<p>A placeholder for the index contents.  If this element is missing,
then no index will be generated, even if there are <elemref gi=index>
elements present elsewhere in the document.
-->

<element gi='kbd'>
<p>Verbatim text, marked out as being for a user to type.

<element gi='keyword'>
<p>A keyword suitable for use when indexing this document.  There is
not yet a list of preferred keywords.

<element gi='li'>
<p>An item in a list.

<element gi='m'>
<p>Inline maths.  Use LaTeX notation, as if you were writing inside a
<code/$...$/ pair in a LaTeX document.

<element gi='meqnarray'>
<p>Displayed maths equation.  Use LaTeX notation, as if you were
writing inside a <code/\\begin{eqnarray}...\\end{eqnarray}/ pair.

<element gi='mequation'>
<p>Displayed equation.  Use LaTeX notation, as if you were writing
inside a <code/\\begin{equation}...\\end{equation/ pair in a LaTeX
document.


<element gi='note'>
<p>A sidenote.  This will be displayed as either a footnote or an
endnote, depending on the output format.

<!--
notecontents element removed
<element gi='notecontents'>
<p>A placeholder for the note contents.  If there are <elemref
gi=note> elements elsewhere in the document, then this element should
be present in the <elemref gi=backmatter> element, even if the
application processes <elemref gi=note> elements by turning them into
footnotes (as will likely be the case for formatting on paper).
-->

<element gi='ol'>
<p>An ordered list.

<element gi='otherauthors'>
<p>This element contains a list of <elemref gi=author> elements, which
give credit to individuals who have contributed to a document without
being principal or current authors.  If part of a document has been
included from someone else's document, or if a document has been
handed over from one maintainer to another, then the appropriate
author should be credited here.

<element gi='p'>
<p>A paragraph.  See also the <elemref gi=px> element.

<element gi='px'>
<p>A restricted paragraph.

<p>In certain contexts, it is convenient to forbid certain elements from
otherwise-unrestricted paragraph text.  The
<elemref self gi=px> element has the same usage as <elemref gi=p>, but
with a slightly restricted content model.

<element gi='quote'>
<p>A simple quotation, the in-line companion to the <elemref
gi=blockquote> element.

<element gi='ref'>
<p>A reference to another point in the same document.  The element has
no content -- the link text will, in general, be generated for you, based on
the link target.  Any element which has an ID attribute may be linked
to.  A small subtlety is that the link is to a complete <em/element/ of the
document, rather than a <em/point/ of the document.
<example>
See also &lt;ref id=other.ref> for more details.
</example>
<attribute name='id'>
<p>The ID of the element to link to.
<attribute name='text'>
<p>If present, the attribute's data is used to form the link text,
rather than generating it based on the target.

<element gi='routinelist'>
<p>This element introduces the <elemref gi=codecollection> elements
which link this document to the source code it explains.

<element gi='row'>
<p>A row of a <elemref gi='table'>

<element gi='sect'>
<p>This element <em/contains/ a section.

<p>The content of this element starts with a <elemref gi=subhead>
element, which in turn contains a <elemref gi=title> element, and the
two are followed by the section content.  Note, however, that since 
the <elemref gi=subhead> and <elemref gi=title> start and end tags are
both omissable, you may omit both, and follow the <elemref self
gi=sect> start tag with the section title.

<p>That is, the structure is formally
<example><![ cdata [
<sect><subhead><title>Section title</title><subhead>
<p>Section body</p>
</sect>
]]></example>
but this may be abbreviated to just
<example><![ cdata [
<sect>Section title
<p>Section body
]]></example>
The same is true for the 
<elemref gi=subsect>,
<elemref gi=subsubsect>, and
<elemref gi=subsubsubsect>
elements.

<p>Note that the <elemref self gi=sect> element contains the <elemref
gi=subsect> element, but not the <elemref gi=subsubsect> element -- it
is therefore impossible to break the sectioning structure.

<attribute name='id'>
<p>An ID for this section, to allow it to be referred to from elsewhere.
<attribute name='export'>
<p>If this attribute is present, then the SGML system will allow other
documents to link to this section using this ID.  In other words, the
presence of this attribute is a commitment to maintain this ID as a
meaningful link target in future versions of this document.
<p>You should include this attribute on all sections and subsections.
This is enforced by the DTD for <elemref self gi=sect> and <elemref
gi=subsect> elements.
<p>Note that the DTD and processing system do not <em/default/ this
attribute to be present, but require you to insert it explicitly.
This is so that you are aware that the ID has been exported, and that it
might therefore be referred to by another document, so that you should
not change the ID once the document has been published.
<attribute name='indexkey'>
<p>If this attribute is present, then an index entry is made, pointing
to this section, with the specified key.

<element gi='strong'>
<p>The marked up text is displayed with strong emphasis.  See also
<elemref gi=em>.

<element gi='subhead'>
<p>See element <elemref gi=sect>
<element gi='subsect'>
<p>See element <elemref gi=sect>
<element gi='subsubsect'>
<p>See element <elemref gi=sect>
<element gi='subsubsubsect'>
<p>See element <elemref gi=sect>

<element gi='sun'>
<p>The top-level of the SUN document type.  Other document types such
as SSNs, SGPs, etc, have corresponding top-level elements.

<element gi='table'>
<p>The Starlink General DTD incorporates the Oasis Exchange Table
Model, which is a restricted, and hence portable, subset of the full
CALS table model.  The model is documented at
<code>http://www.oasis-open.org/html/techpubs.htm/a503.htm</code>.

<p>At present, the Oasis table model is not fully supported by the
Starlink SGML system.  
All of the elements in the model are supported, but most of the 
attributes are ignored.  You may mark up your document using all the
features in the Oasis model.
I will progressively add support for these attributes
as time permits.

<attribute name='id'>
<p>An ID for the table.
<attribute name='export'>
<p>If present, then the ID is `exported', and may be linked to from
other Starlink documents.
<attribute name='float'>
<p>If the float attribute is present and has value `float', then the
table may be moved to a more suitable place in the document, if this
would help to avoid an ugly pagebreak, for example.  If the
attribute is missing or has the value `nofloat', then it is pinned to
its current location.


<element gi='tbody'>
<p>A table body.  This contains a series of table rows.

<element gi='tgroup'>
<p>This element is an enclosure for a table body (the <elemref
gi=tbody> element), optionally preceded by a header (the <elemref
gi=thead> element).  The number of columns in the table must be
specified by this element.
<attribute name='cols'>
<p>The number of columns in the enclosed <elemref gi=thead> and
<elemref gi=tbody> elements.

<element gi='thead'>
<p>Encloses one or more heading rows prefixed to a <elemref gi=tbody>.

<element gi='title'>
<p>This element may enclose either the document title, or a section
title.  As explained in the documentation for the <elemref gi=sect>
element, this element's start and end tags are usually omitted when
specifying a section title.

<element gi='ul'>
<p>An unordered list.

<element gi='update'>
<p>When updates are made to a document, they should be noted by (at
least) a <elemref gi=change> element in the <elemref gi=history>.
When more, or more localised, detail is desired, an <elemref self
gi=update> element can include notes within the text.  There may be
one or more <elemref self gi=update> elements as the first children of
those elements which include it as a child.

<p>See the documentation of the <elemref gi=history> element for an example.

<element gi='url'>
<p>This element encloses a URL, which is displayed appropriately.  If
the output medium permits it, the URL's text is made a link to the
remote resource.  The difference between this element and the <elemref
gi=webref> element is that in the case of the <elemref self gi=url>
element, the link text is the URL itself.
<attribute name='nolink'>
<p>If present, then the URL is displayed without the URL text being
made an active link.

<element gi='verbatim'>
<p>The enclosed text is displayed verbatim, specifically with
linebreaks respected, and typically in a fixed-width font.  Note that
the element's content is <em/not/ specially escaped.  If you wish to
include text which is meaningful to the SGML parser, you should
surround the text with a <code/CDATA/ marked section.

<element gi='version'>
<p>The version of the document.  See <elemref gi='history'> for an
overview of the history element.
<attribute name='date'>
<p>When the version was released.
<attribute name='author'>
<p>Who approved the distribution.  This is an ID which appears in the
list of authors.  This might in fact be a reference to an `editor' of
the document (ie, an `author' listed in the <elemref gi=editors>
element), rather than an author.
<attribute name='number'>
<p>The assigned version number.    This is not
generated automatically, to allow the numbering to start other than at
one, or to omit numbers for some reason, but the numbers should be
allocated sequentially, unless there is a good reason to decide
otherwise.

<element gi='webref'>
<p>Make a link to a resource on the web.  The element's content is
used as the link text.  See also the <elemref gi=url> element.
<attribute name='url'>
<p>The URL of the resource to be linked to.
