<sect id=intro export>Introduction

<p>This is a document which exists only to refer to another.  I can
refer to other sections such as <ref id=detail>.  This section has an
`exported' label, and so could be referred to by another document.

<sect id=detail>Further details

<p>As well as that, I can refer to sections in Star2HTML documents, as
long as we have a `DocumentSummary' for them.  The result is
<docxref doc="sun188.summary" loc="index_files">.  There are further
details on
