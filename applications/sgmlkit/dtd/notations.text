<!--========== Notations ==========

  The notation declarations are broken off into this separate file, with
  the FOSI PUBLIC "-//Starlink//DTD Notation Declarations//EN".  See
  the main DTD for discussion.

  TeX and LaTeX notations defined using the ISBN prefix, as defined in
  ISO/IEC 9070:1991, `Information Technology - SGML support facilities
  - Registration procedures for public text owner identifiers'

  JPEG notation from the recommendations in ISO/IEC JTC1/WG4 N1990:
  `Information Processing - Text and office systems - Using SGML
  Public Identifiers for Specifying Data Notations' (see
  <http://www.ornl.gov/sgml/wg8/document/1990.htm>.  GIF, EPS and
  linespecific notations from DocBook's dbnotn.mod module.

  The latexmaths notation is specifically LaTeX maths, nothing else.
  The latexgraphics notation is intended to be for verbatim LaTeX
  including, but not limited to, a \begin{picture}...\end{picture}
  environment, and including in principle any of the `portable'
  graphics mechanisms described in Chapter 10 of the LaTeX Companion.
  This is obviously abusable, but there should be the sternest rants
  in the documentation against taking advantage of this to get up to
  mucky hacks (you'll grow hairs on the backs of your hands, you know).

	<!-- Figure notations which use only SGML characters (terminology? see
	     8879, 9.2), which can therefore be included directly within
	     figurecontent element -->

<!-- Declare an attribute for the latexgraphics notation.  If there is
     indeed a need for this (and it's not implemented at present),
     then it can be used as follows.  In the DTD subset, declare an
     entity as follows:

       <!DOCTYPE ... [
       ...
       <!ENTITY % notations-subset 
          PUBLIC "-//Starlink//DTD Notation Declarations//EN">
       %notations-subset;
       <!ENTITY ltx-file SYSTEM "things.tex" 
          NDATA latexgraphics [ package=stuff ]>
       ...
       ]>

     indicating that the ltx-file entity requires the `stuff' package
     to work.  This has to be done in this rather roundabout way, since
     there's no way to refer to data attributes in an element
     attribute.
