        -- CATALOG-override is identical to CATALOG, except that it has 
           `OVERRIDE YES' at the beginning of it.  This means that public IDs
           within the catalog override system IDs, which makes it more usable
           for XML documents, which require a system ID for (for example)
           DTDs, even when a public ID would be more useful and portable.
