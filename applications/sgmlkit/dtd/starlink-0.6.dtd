  independently, but invoked from another DTD via:

    <!ENTITY % Starlink.general
	PUBLIC "-//Starlink//DTD Starlink General 0.6//EN">

  The DTD should define the following parameter entities:

<!--========== Notations ==========-->
<!-- Read in the set of defined data notations.

     These are kept in a separate file, because one of the notations (at
     present) defines data attributes (see 8879, Sect. 11.4).  If we want
     to define, in the DTD subset, entities which use any of these
     attributes, the notation declaration must come first (see
     Sect. 11.4.1.2, whereas notation definitions can be used before they
     are defined (Sect. 11.4.1.1)).  We can arrange this by explicitly
     reading in the notation declarations in the DTD subset using the
     formula below.  This is certainly a bit clunky, but clear.

     The subset defines the entity %notations-read to be IGNORE, so that
     the subset can't be read twice.

     The title element deliberately has a rather simple content model
     because it's this element which is most likely to appear
     in contexts remote from the General DTD (such as the DocumentSummary,
     or HTML TITLE elements, or some cavern in this search engine we keep
     talking about), so any markup in there would have to be reprocessed
     (which would typically mean stripped) every time it's transformed.
     This element is therefore defined with a model which is such that
     simply stripping the markup from the TITLE content would be a
     reasonable `transformation': this is a restriction the document
     author might need to be aware of, so this should be documented.

     As a companion to this, the DISPLAYTITLE element has a full content
     model, and is intended to be used as a presentation title.

<!-- Use the OASIS Exchange Table Model subset of the CALS table model.
     See http://www.oasis-open.org/html/a503.htm for discussion, and
     http://www.oasis-open.org/html/publtext.htm for public texts.

     The Exchange Table Model can be customised.  Adjust the table entry
     model, and remove the %titles entity

     Also rename the table element to `tabular'.  This fits in well with
     the LaTeX model folk will be familiar with, and allows us to
     separate the floating plus captioning plus ID stuff from the
     lining-it-up-in-columns of tabular layouts.

<!-- The FIGURE element contains a sequence of _alternatives_ for the
     figure's content.  The application may choose any one of these
     alternatives as the effective content of the figure.  If there are
     none it can use, it should fail gracefully, but the way in which it
     fails is not defined here.

     The FIGURECONTENT element contains content in a specified notation.
     Text notations for figures (ie, notations using character data as
     opposed to non-SGML data, as described in 8879, B.13) may be
     included directly within the element.  Alternatively, and
     necessarily if the notation is a non-text format, the content of the
     element may be specified in an external entity.  It would be good
     practice for such an entity declaration to hava a data content
     notation (8879, 10.6.5) (for example <!ENTITY figure.test system
     "file.eps" ndata eps>); the implementation should warn if the
     (required) notation on the element conflicts with that for the
     entity, but should let the latter prevail.

     The figurecontent element may be followed by one or more paragraphs.
     These should collectively be taken to be a single further
     alternative (though typically, such an alternative will be the only
     one proffered).

     At some point, I should make a HyTime declaration of the
     transclusion element FIGURECONTENT.
