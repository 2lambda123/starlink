<![ IGNORE [
  DTD for program source code structure.

  This DTD was not designed to be used on its own, but instead
  INCLUDEd at the end of a language-specific DTD, which defines a
  notation, and sets up shortref maps to make inputting the source
  file easier - for example, the Fortran DTD makes `^*+' a shortref
  for the CODEPROLOGUE start tag, and IGNOREs `^*' within the
  CODEPROLOGUE.  However, since it _is_ intended to be used as an
  architecture, it _could_ be used on its own, if you have an
  application which can benefit from that.  I would recommend not
  doing that, however, until there's a clear benefit: the present
  practice of making different `editions' of this for different
  languages forces me to think a little about the different languages'
  requirements, and which features might need to be restricted or expanded.

  Additions to the list of supported languages requires at least
  modifying the %notationlist ENTITY, and adding appropriate notation
  definitions.

  Invoke with something like:

    <!ENTITY % DTD.Version "DTD Starlink Fortrancode 0.6">
    <!ENTITY % language.attr	-- language name --
	 "language NOTATION (fortran77) #FIXED fortran77">
    <!ENTITY % generalcode.dtd
	PUBLIC "-//Starlink//DTD Program Source Code 0.6//EN">
    %generalcode.dtd;

  The definition of the %language.attr ENTITY is required.
  The %direction.attr ENTITY may also be predefined, and if the DTD
  which calls this one wishes to do other architectural remapping
  (only the DSSSL one does at present), then it can define further
  attributes as noted below.

<!--========== Special entity ==========-->
<!-- I need to be able to refer to the SGML declaration which is
     appropriate for this DTD, from within the stylesheets.  Since
     DSSSL doesn't have access to the entity manager (I don't think),
     and since I can't work out how to declare entities in the catalog
     (the ENTITY declaration seems not to work as I'd expect it to),
     the only way round seems to be to declare an entity here which
     points to the declaration's public-id.  This is available to the
     stylesheets, and the catalog can resolve it ok.  I think....

     I don't believe this is the best way to go about this, but I
     _cannot_ work out a better one.

     This is a copy of the corresponding declaration in the Starlink
     General DTD.

<!--============================== Entities ==============================
  Collect parameter entities here.  These could be overridden by the
  invoking DTD.
-->

<!-- The %direction.attr ENTITY is attached to function arguments, and
     indicates which direction the argument is moving.  Calling DTDs may
     modify this as appropriate, as long as the modified version is a
     subset of this list.  

     Once included `givenandreturned', but this was removed, and the
     default changed, after the SGML meeting on 19991019.

<!-- %language.attr ENTITY must be declared by the DTD which includes
     this one.  That DTD should declare the ENTITY as something like

       <!ENTITY % language.attr

<!ENTITY % language.attr

<!-- Just for convenience, also define a LT ENTITY -->
<!ENTITY lt "<">

<!-- Language notations are declared here.  The DTDs which INCLUDE
     this one may declare attributes to these notations (for example, the
     DSSSLCODE DTD uses the DSSSL notation to declare the DSSSL DTD as an
     architecture).  See ``ISO/IEC JTC1/WG4 N1958, Information technology
     - Text and office SYSTEMs - Using SGML Public Identifiers for
     Specifying Data Notations''
     <http://www.ornl.gov/sgml/wg4/document/1958.htm>.

     Note that the DSSSL notation declaration mentioned in the above
     document is different from this (unimportantly, I believe).

     Note also that I've changed the name of the Fortran notation to
     Fortran77, to support a future distinction of this from Fortran 90.

     Also rename the table element to `tabular'.  This fits in well with
     the LaTeX model folk will be familiar with, and allows us to
     separate the floating plus captioning plus ID stuff from the
     lining-it-up-in-columns of tabular layouts.
