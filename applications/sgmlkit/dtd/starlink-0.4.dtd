  This is the Starlink General DTD.  It should not be used
  independently, but invoked from another DTD via:

    <!entity % Starlink.general
	public "-//Starlink//DTD Starlink General 0.4//EN">
    %Starlink.general;

  The DTD should define the following parameter entities:

    DocClass       : as SUN, SGP, etc
    req.abstract   : see below
    DTD.Version    : version of the calling DTD

  Defaults for these (except DTD.Version) are given below.

  There's a feature here I don't understand.  I had thought that the
  appropriate way to switch between entity sets (for LaTeX or HTML
  output) was to use SDATA entities.  However, when I do that - doing
  something like <!entity copy SDATA "(c)">, what emerges from the
  Jade Transform back-end is what looks like a multibyte character
  reference &#65533, independently of what I have in the actual SDATA
  entity declaration.  The LaTeX-Transform back-end I wrote emits
  SDATA entity content verbatim.  I can't find any enlightenment in
  Goldfarb, either; the HTML entities are therefore currently defined
  using CDATA character entities.

  The TITLE element contains the document title, or the section title

  The title element deliberately has a rather simple content model
  because it's this element which is most likely to appear
  in contexts remote from the General DTD (such as the DocumentSummary,
  or HTML TITLE elements, or some cavern in this search engine we keep
  talking about), so any markup in there would have to be reprocessed
  (which would typically mean stripped) every time it's transformed.
  This element is therefore defined with a model which is such that
  simply stripping the markup from the TITLE content would be a
  reasonable `transformation': this is a restriction the document
  author might need to be aware of, so this should be documented.

  As a companion to this, the DISPLAYTITLE element has a full content
  model, and is intended to be used as a presentation title.

<!--========== Maths ==========
  The M element corresponds to $...$ in TeX.  MEQUATION in text
  corresponds to the equation environment.  MEQNARRAY corresponds to
  the eqnarray environment, but with each line of the alignment
  specified in a MLINE element.  The content of each should be raw
  LaTeX, appropriate to the context, so that the content of MLINE
  within MEQNARRAY should have two & characters in it, but not when
  it's within just MEQUATION.  There's therefore a slight ambiguity, but
  resolving it (perhaps by specifying structure within the eqnarray
  line corresponding to the three fields) would create more confusion
  than light.  As well, there's an implementation advantage to having
  the two display elements have the same GI, as this makes equation
  numbering easier in DSSSL.

  It might seem nice to have the MLINE attributes on the MEQUATION
  element, and avoid having the intermediate MLINE element, but (a)
  the MLINE is completely omissable unless you want to refer to the
  equation, and (b) the symmetry makes implementation a lot easier.

  In principle there are no restrictions on what LaTeX goes in here,
  other than that it be valid, but in practice, I expect that the
  author might need some slight awareness of any restrictions of the
  actual implementation.

  Note that I'm declaring this as PCDATA content, accepting the force
  of the overwhelmingly negative discussion of CDATA/RCDATA at
  http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/topics.html#CDATA.  Note also that
  this means that & _is_ interpreted as an entity reference - there's
  a list of ways to get round that in one of the postings at that URL,
  but the simplest seem to be either AT&amp;T or <![cdata[ AT&T ]]>.

<!--
  DOCXREF cross-references elements and data within other Starlink documents,
  ie ones which have a number of the format SUN/123, or whatever.  Refer to
  the document using a rflocsrc of this format, and further discriminate using
  an (`exported') ID within that document.  I considered using XPointers to
  refer to IDs or other content within that document, but confined it, for the
  moment, just to IDs.  This can be extended in the future to full XPointer
  queries, without invalidating anything which is valid under this more
  restrictive declaration (a bare ID is a valid XPointer (check!)).  XLL isn't
  a solution here, because we don't want to be confined to referring to the
  other document through a URI.  XPointers should be more generally
  implemented in future, so this notation will fit naturally into a future
  development of this format, into XML, for example.

  This is all more intricate than it might at first appear: see HyTime clause
  7.8.

  The following is very closely related to the example in HyTime note
  176, except that the equivalent of LOC there has an incorrect value
  prescription of IDREFS, which is corrected in the first TC.  In an
  earlier version of this (never implemented), the DOC attribute had a
  value prescription of CDATA, and was interpreted as a queryloc for a
  Starlink document.  This might seem more straightforward, but I
  think it's probably less good.  The current scheme, with the DOC
  declared as an entity, means that we have to predeclare all the
  entities we might want to refer to.  That doesn't seem like a good
  thing, but it means that they can all be declared in one catalogue,
  specific to a site, and that intelligence about where documents are
  (local or through a URL?) can be encoded there, specific to each
  site where the documents are used.

  The link's effective content should be whatever corresponds to the title of
  the object addressed by LOC.

  The FIGURECONTENT element contains content in a specified notation.
  Text notations for figures (ie, notations using character data as

  practice for such an entity declaration to hava a data content
  notation (8879, 10.5.5) (for example <!entity figure.test system
  "file.eps" ndata eps>); the implementation should warn if the
  (required) notation on the element conflicts with that for the
  entity, but should let the latter prevail.
