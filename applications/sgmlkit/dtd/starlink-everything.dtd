  `everything' DTD.
  This is a pseudo-DTD, intended to be parsed by documentation tools.
  It includes the Starlink General DTD, with the entity
  %Feature.Everything set to include.  This includes _all_ features of
  the General DTD.  Note that this is _not_ to be used for documents,
  as some of the features in the General DTD may be mutually
  exclusive.
