	SGML Declaration for Starlink DTDs

	This was originally based on the HTML one, and has presently
	been modified to the extent of changing the APPINFO parameter
	to "ArcBase" (for HyTime), and allowing SUBDOCs and IMPLICIT
	LINKs.  It might need review at some point, not least to sort
	out the anomaly in the descset which maps the right hand part
	of Latin1 to ordinary ASCII.

	Changes from HTML declaration:

	LCNMCHAR/UCNMCHAR: added '_', so that old star2html
		cross-references are allowable as IDs.
	NAMECASE: GENERAL NO: no case-folding, again so that old
		cross-references can be correctly distinguished.  This
		is probably a good idea anyway, as it makes the DTD
		and documents more nearly conformant with XML, which
		has GENERAL NO in its (fixed) declaration.  It did
		require quite a lot of DTD editing, though....
	SHORTREF: four shortrefs added, three (*+, *-, *) so that
		Fortran code prologues can be abbreviated, and a
		further one (three hyphens) so that em-dashes can be
		represented (that last one's sugar).
	LINK IMPLICIT YES: I did at one time have this turned on
		because I was experimenting with LPDs.  I don't think
		we actually have a use for those, however, so I've
		turned it back off (XML again).
	SUBDOC YES: we use subdocuments (not conformant with XML).
	APPINFO "ArcBase": we use HyTime, but not "SGML Document Access".
