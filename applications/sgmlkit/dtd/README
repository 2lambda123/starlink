Files and directories here:

catalog

	This is the catalogue file which associates public text
	identifiers with system entities.

mud-0.1.dtd
ssn-0.1.dtd
sun-0.1.dtd
starlink-0.1.dtd
summary-0.1.dtd

	These are the DTDs for Starlink documentation.  The
	starlink-0.1.dtd DTD is the main `Starlink General DTD'.  The
	MUD, SSN and SUN DTDs invoke it, after first defining
	parameter entities to include and exclude parts of the General
	DTD.  The summary DTD is a hugely cut-down version of the
	General DTD, used both as an architecture within the General
	DTD, and as a DTD for summaries of other Starlink documents
	produced either from Star2HTML source or otherwise.

starlink.decl@
starlink.decl.linux
starlink.decl.std

	The SGML declarations appropriate to the DTDs.  There is a
	slight wrinkle in that there is a special version for Linux
	(see notes within).  This workaround may no longer be necessary.

entities.sgml

	Miscellaneous entities, for things like &gt and &pound.  These
	are rather randomly selected, and should probably be
	rationalised.  As I _now_ understand it, these should probably
	be specified as SDATA entities (see 8879, clause 10.5.3),
	probably within the ISOent directory below.

dsssl/
hytime/
ISOent/

	The DTDs for DSSSL stylesheets, and the HyTime architectural
	forms.  As noted in the catalog in this directory, I've had to
	adjust the hi2mdhty.sgm file to get round an interpretation
	problem in SP.  The ISOent directory contains an ISO standard
	set of entities.  These are SDATA entities, which means that
	they are intended to be system-specific.

docbook/
html/

	For reference, these are the DocBook and HTML DTDs.  This
	includes HTML 1, 2 and 3.2, and the DTD and declaration for
	ISO HTML (15445:1998.  See
	ftp://ftp.cs.tcd.ie/isohtml/FinalCD.html).  These directories
	contain their own catalogs -- they are not included in the
	main catalog.
