Files and directories here:

dsssl/
hytime/
ISOent/

	The DTDs for DSSSL stylesheets, and the HyTime architectural
	forms.  As noted in the catalog in this directory, I've had to
	adjust the hi2mdhty.sgm file to get round an interpretation
	problem in SP.  The ISOent directory contains an ISO standard
	set of entities.  These are SDATA entities, which means that
	they are intended to be system-specific.

docbook/
html/

	For reference, these are the DocBook and HTML DTDs.  This
	includes HTML 1, 2 and 3.2, and the DTD and declaration for
	ISO HTML (15445:1998.  See
	ftp://ftp.cs.tcd.ie/isohtml/FinalCD.html).  These directories
	contain their own catalogs -- they are not included in the
	main catalog.
