	-- catalog: SGML Open style entity catalogue for Starlink DTDs

	   $Id$

	   Keep the entries in this file normalised so that each entry
	   is on a single line, the PUBLIC keyword at the beginning is
	   in upper case, and the system id on those lines doesn't have
	   quotes.  This is so that tools such as perlSGML, which have
	   relatively simple catalogue parsers, don't get confused.
	   The SYSTEM entry is an SP extension, and the SP
	   documentation recommends that its sysid2 is quoted to avoid
	   confusing tools which don't recognise it.

	   For details of the catalog format, see James Clark's notes
	   at <http://www.jclark.com/sp/catalog.htm>, or OASIS
	   Technical Resolution 9401:1997, at
	   <http://www.oasis-open.org/html/a401.htm>.
	   --

	-- Keep all the Starlink DTDs and, crucially, their associated
	   SGML declaration, in a separate catalog.  See the catalog
	   file for discussion.

	-- Catalog entry for HyTime meta-DTD
	   from the HyTime source distribution at http://www.ornl.gov/sgml/wg4/

	   Note that the HyTime DTD I use here is that obtained from WG4, with
	   the addition of a COM token which seemed to be missing, and the
	   declaration of a REFSUB attribute to the hylink AF, which I _think_
	   is missing, too, and without which, REFSUB isn't declared
	   anywhere, and the declaration of clink fails with an error.

	   As explained by Eliot Kimber, in a posting
	   <35EEA7F8.8D04857A@isogen.com> on comp.text.sgml, because REFSUB is
	   remapped to LINKEND, there's no actual need for the REFSUB attribute
	   at all.  However, SP's architectural processor still wants it.  I'm
	   not sure what's the best way to get round this, short of fiddling
	   with the HyTime DTD (which is what I've still done).

	   the file (the one above is).  However, the HyTime meta-DTD
	   appears to want this file, but refers to it by this
	   following entity name.  So add it, and hope for the best!
