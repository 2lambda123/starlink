	  catalog: SGML Open style entity catalogue for Starlink DTDs
	  $Id$

	  Keep the entries in this file normalised so that each entry
	  is on a single line, the PUBLIC keyword at the beginning is
	  in upper case, and the system id on those lines doesn't have
	  quotes.  This is so that tools such as perlSGML, which have
	  relatively simple catalogue parsers, don't get confused.
	  The SYSTEM entry is an SP extension, and the SP
	  documentation recommends that its sysid2 is quoted to avoid
	  confusing tools which don't recognise it.

  Catalog entry for HyTime meta-DTD
  from the HyTime source distribution at http://www.ornl.gov/sgml/wg4/

  Note that the HyTime DTD I use here is that obtained from WG4, with
  the addition of a COM token which seemed to be missing, and the
  declaration of a REFSUB attribute to the hylink AF, which I _think_
  is missing, too, and without which, REFSUB isn't declared anywhere,
  and the declaration of clink fails with an error.

  As explained by Eliot Kimber, in a posting
  <35EEA7F8.8D04857A@isogen.com> on comp.text.sgml, because REFSUB is
  remapped to LINKEND, there's no actual need for the REFSUB attribute
  at all.  However, SP's architectural processor still wants it.  I'm
  not sure what's the best way to get round this, short of fiddling
  with the HyTime DTD (which is what I've still done).
