	-- catalog: SGML Open style entity catalogue for Starlink DTDs

	   $Id$

	   Keep the entries in this file normalised so that each entry
	   is on a single line, the PUBLIC keyword at the beginning is
	   in upper case, and the system id on those lines doesn't have
	   quotes.  This is so that tools such as perlSGML, which have
	   relatively simple catalogue parsers, don't get confused.
	   The SYSTEM entry is an SP extension, and the SP
	   documentation recommends that its sysid2 is quoted to avoid
	   confusing tools which don't recognise it.

	   For details of the catalog format, see James Clark's notes
	   at <http://www.jclark.com/sp/catalog.htm>, or OASIS
	   Technical Resolution 9401:1997, at
	   <http://www.oasis-open.org/html/a401.htm>.

	-- The Starlink DTDs use the SGML declaration contained in the
	   s.o.i. starlink.decl.  This declaration now
	   includes NAMECASE GENERAL NO.  This declaration has to be
	   selected when the document is passed to the SGML parser: we
	   cannot declare it here using an SGMLDECL declaration, since
	   this would also affect DTDs such as the DSSSL stylesheet
	   DTDs.  If this declaration is found when extracting an
	   architecture (for example, when Jade extracts the DSSSL
	   architecture from a stylesheet), then all hell breaks
	   loose.

	   My understanding of the OASIS TR above suggests that the
	   first SGMLDECL entry in the whole catalog (possibly
	   composed of several catalog entry files) governs all the
	   DTDs mentioned.  However, the DELEGATE declaration, unlike
	   the CATALOG declaration, creates a completely _new_
	   catalog.

	   I tried delegating public-ids starting `-//Starlink' to a
	   different catalog, but that was unsuccessful for two
	   reasons.  (1) In a delegated catalog, the entity manager
	   only sees these mappings once the parser has started on the
	   parsing of the document, so including SGMLDECL in that
	   delegated catalog has no effect (is this correct?).  The
	   DTDDECL feature of catalogs would have been nice, but
	   SP/Jade does not support it.  (2) When I resolve public
	   identifiers which match the delegation to the delegated
	   catalog, I sometimes get _weird_ generated-system-id
	   strings coming back: it seems to work in the case where the
	   public-id does have a match in the delegated catalog, but
	   where the public-id doesn't match, or in the case of the
	   `-//Starlink//SYNTAX...' declaration below, the sys-ids are
	   odd.  For example, given the public ID
	   "-//Starlink//DOCUMENT Summary SUN/188//EN", without a
	   matching catalog entry, the function
	   (entity-generated-system-id) produces `<CATALOG
	   PUBLIC="-//Starlink//DOCUMENT Summary SUN/188//EN">
	   <OSFILE>/home/norman/s/src/sgml/w/sgml/dtd/CATALOG.starlink',
	   which doesn't really help very much.  I can't even find any
	   mention of what the <CATALOG...> storage manager is in
	   HyTime clause A.6, so perhaps it's some SP/Jade internal
	   thing.  -- 

-- Do not include the SGMLDECL or DELEGATE keywords 
SGMLDECL starlink.decl
DELEGATE "-//Starlink" CATALOG.starlink
--

	-- Include here a public-id for the Starlink and XML
           declarations, so they can be referred to from within the
           stylesheets.

	   Use a public text class of `TEXT', since none of the public
	   text classes of 10.2.2.1 match.  `SYNTAX' isn't correct,
	   since that refers to a specific part of the declaration,
	   and `SD', as described in Annex K.3.1, in the Web SGML
	   adaptations (ISO 8879 TC2), isn't correct either, since
	   that refers to the `SGML declaration body', rather than the
	   declaration itself.  In any case, the need for this
	   declaration is so that it can be prepended to documents in
	   auxiliary parses (within DSSSL), in which context it is
	   treated as an ordinary text file anyway.

	-- Catalog entry for HyTime meta-DTD
	   from the HyTime source distribution at http://www.ornl.gov/sgml/wg4/

	   Note that the HyTime DTD I use here is that obtained from WG4, with
	   the addition of a COM token which seemed to be missing, and the
	   declaration of a REFSUB attribute to the hylink AF, which I _think_
	   is missing, too, and without which, REFSUB isn't declared
	   anywhere, and the declaration of clink fails with an error.

	   As explained by Eliot Kimber, in a posting
	   <35EEA7F8.8D04857A@isogen.com> on comp.text.sgml, because REFSUB is
	   remapped to LINKEND, there's no actual need for the REFSUB attribute
	   at all.  However, SP's architectural processor still wants it.  I'm
	   not sure what's the best way to get round this, short of fiddling
	   with the HyTime DTD (which is what I've still done).
