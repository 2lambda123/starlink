<!--
  Additional SDATA entities, for LaTeX use.

  The SDATA entities emerge wrongly from DSSSL (data) functions.
  Don't know why.  We can't work around this by changing these to
  CDATA entities, because then the replacement text is carefully
  escaped by the back-end.

  The existence of these entities is largely demanded by the LaTeX
  Jade back-end.  The entities which expand to \Char... are problematically
  escaped by the back-end, because they're escaped to \charnn.  This
  number nn is the correct one, but produces the wrong glyph when it
  appears in a roman font.  The back-end has to take care of defining
  the commands \Char... appropriately, with suitable font-switching.
