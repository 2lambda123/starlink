  This is the summary DTD.  It's intended to describe the
  bibliographic information, and outline structure of, a document.

  Instances of this DTD will either be document instances, written by
  hand or generated from some other document format, or they will be
  architectural instances, typically (exclusively?) from the Starlink
  general DTD.

  Public identifier will be:

    "-//Starlink//DTD Document Summary 0.1//EN"

  It has no optional features.

<!--
  The URLLINKPOLICY attribute governs how we may produce HTML links to
  elements within the instance.  If the policy is "EXPLICIT", then
  elements to be linked to should have the URLPATH attribute present,
  and this will be used to construct the URL which references the
  element (this is appropriate for DocumentSummary instances produced
  from Starlink LaTeX files).  If the policy is "AUTOMATIC", then the
  URLPATH attribute should _not_ be present, and a URL will be
  generated by the stylesheet (appropriate for instances produced from
  the instances of the General DTD).  If the policy is "NONE", then no
  links will be generated.

  If EXPORTEDLINKPOLICY has the value "ONLYEXPORTED" then we may only
  link to elements which have the EXPORT attribute present; if it has
  the value "ALL", then we may link to all elements.

  DOCINFO element is much like that in the Starlink General DTD, with
  the inclusion of the type attribute to the docnumber element, and
  the removal of the history 
  element (this, and the omission of a date element, is temporary,
  until I can work out the best way of including something like this
  for DTDs which omit that element).

  For further discussion of the common elements, see the Starlink
  General DTD.

  Labels a point in the document, for linking to by internal _or_
  _external_ documents.  The actual link target may be elsewhere, such
  as a section heading.  This has no analogue in the Starlink General
  DTD, but does have an analogue in the \xlabel macro in the Star2HTML
  LaTeX extensions (ie, \xlabel appears _within_ the body of sections,
  etc, rather than in the section itself).

  There is a case for adding this to the General DTD as well, and
  making the link target be the linkable object _containing_ this
  label, but I haven't implemented this yet.

  The URLPATH attribute gives the last part of the URL which should be
  used to link to this point.  A complete URL should be formed by
  tacking the content of this attribute to ... FIXME.
  At present, make the URLPATH attribute _required_.  It's only
  currently used when generating documentsummary documents from LaTeX
  source, and so should always be present, because the notation for
  locating sections within Star2HTML is different from the one
  generated by the SGML stylesheets.

  The export and urlpath attributes are currently required - this is
  sensible as long as this element is generated only from Star2HTML
  documents.  It could be relaxed if this element is used in other
  contexts, too.
