<subsect id=release-0.5 export>Release Notes, version DR-0.5

<p>This is developers' release 0.5.

<subsubsect>New in this release

<p>Prior to the SGML meeting scheduled for Friday 24 September, I've
made assorted further changes of detail, mostly to the Programcode
DTD, as agreed at the last programmers' meeting.  These have been
implemented in both the HTML and &latex; down-converters, but not yet
documented.

<subsubsect>Changes

<p>The following are the changes to the Programcode DTD agreed after
the last meeting. 
<dl>

<dt>CODEPROLOGUE content model
<dd>The CODEPROLOGUE element has changed to ROUTINEPROLOGUE, and
almost all of its contents are now optional, as well as being in any
order.  As a result, the MISCCODE element is redundant, and has been
removed.

<dt>Paragraph content
<dd>The paragraph content model has been substantially enlarged, and
is now identical with that of the General DTD, with the exception of
the cross-reference elements.  As part of this, the General DTD was
substantially restructured, to extract the paragraph-content elements
into a separate DTD fragment, which the two DTDs share.

<dt>The changes are implemented in the down-converters
<dd>&ellip; though not very prettily.  They <em/should/ be robust
enough that trial documents conforming to the updated DTDs should be
testable.

<dt>Defects list added
<dd>The `defects list' is now part of the maintained code, and
included in the distribution.  This is the (supposedly authoritative)
list of what changes have been suggested, and comments on their
implementation.


</dl>

<subsubsect>Outstanding issues

<p>This is the to-do list.  These are the issues which should either
be addressed before the next full release, or postponed as being
unresolvable just now.  For more wishful thinking, see <ref
id=final.development>.

<p>This is more-or-less the same to-do list as in the previous release
(see <ref id=release-0.4> for details).  This release has concentrated
on the issues arising from the last programmers' meeting.

<dl>
<dt>Bundle Jade with the system
<dd>At present, the distribution consists of the SGML kit plus a Jade
distribution.  However, I still haven't managed to get Jade to build
on Suns or Alphas.  This might change, as work has started -- by the
community rather than James Clark alone -- on an open-source version
of Jade called <webref url='http://jade-cvs.avionitek.com/'
>OpenJade</webref>.  This <em/might/ include work on getting Jade to
build on other platforms.

<dt>Use of FPI: should we use <code>-//Starlink//...</code> or
<code>+//IDN star.rl.ac.uk...</code>? 
<dd>I haven't had any comments or thoughts on this.

<dt>Include some facility for dealing with obsolete exported IDs.
<dd>Since I've had no objections to this structure, I'll include DTD
and down-converter support for this anon.

<dt>Development of the down-converters for the programcode DTD
<dd>These currently work, but the results are hideously ugly.  The
changes also need to be documented.

<dt>Bugs in Jade's LaTeX back-end
<dd>I've since discovered that my identification of these as bugs was
mistaken.  They're features: the character-reference mechanism I
thought was failing was actually the wrong approach, Jade was
correctly barfing on it, and my `fix' was a dirty rotten hack;
unfortunately, Jade doesn't yet seem to support the correct approach,
but OpenJade might soon.

<dt>OpenJade
<dd>I'll see if it's sensible to shift to OpenJade away from Clark's
distribution.

<dt>Defects list
<dd>There are a variety of more-or-less urgent issues notes in the
Defects list.
