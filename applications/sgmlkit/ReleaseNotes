<subsect id=release-0.4 export>Release Notes, version DR-0.4

<p>This (will be) developers' release 0.4.  You are looking at an
unreleased version of this document.

<p>The system relies on the DSSSL engine Jade, but
it does <em/not/ contain a pre-built version of Jade.  See <ref
id=install> for further details of obtaining and building Jade.

<subsubsect>New in this release

<p>None yet.

<subsubsect>Changes

<p>None yet.
<dl>

<dt>Coverpage image in DTD
<dd>Now appears in &latex output, too.

</dl>

<subsubsect>Outstanding issues

<p>This is the to-do list.  These are the issues which should either
be addressed before the next full release, or postponed as being
unresolvable just now.  For more wishful thinking, see <ref
id=final.development>.

<dl>
<dt>Bundle Jade with the system
<dd>At present, the distribution consists only of the SGML library stuff.
I need to work out the magic to get Jade to build on Suns and Alphas,
and then distribute them together.  Since Jade is needed to build the
documetation during installation, you can't even install the package
on systems which don't have Jade.  I therefore haven't tested the
installation makefile other than on Linux: Tru64's make is dumb enough
that I can just about guarantee that there'll be problems there.

<dt>Finish documentation
<dd>Read-through for style, plus more expansive installation notes.

<dt>Use of FPI: should we use <code>-//Starlink//...</code> or
<code>+//IDN star.rl.ac.uk...</code>? 
<dd>The second is a standard `registered prefix' built up from a DNS
domain name.  Is there any prospect of a <code>starlink.ac.uk</code>
domain name?

<dt>Include some facility for dealing with obsolete exported IDs.
<dd>One
possibility (discussed at the programmers' meeting) was <code>&lt;sect
id=newid>Intro&lt;oldid id=oldid></code>, but that's not very flexible
-- it'd only apply to sections.  I thought instead of
<verbatim><![cdata[
<!element oldidlist o o (oldid+)>
<!element oldid     - o EMPTY>
<!attlist oldid
	id	id	#required	-- the now-obsolete id --
	newid	idref	#requred	-- replacement --
	-- resolve a reference to this element as if it were a
           reference to the element pointed to by newid, but
	   warn or issue an error about a deprecation --
	export	(export) #fixed export	-- for compat/consistency? --
	>
]]></verbatim>
This means that at the top of the document (probably), you could
include a list of elements:
<verbatim>
&lt;oldidlist>
&lt;oldid id=old.id newid=replacement.id>
&lt;oldid id=another.id newid=another.replacement>
&lt;/oldidlist>
</verbatim>
This is both perfectly generic, and usefully visible.

<dt>Development of the programcode DTD
<dd>As discussed in <ref id=doccode.devel>, I am uncertain of the
optimal balance between flexibility and structure in the programcode
DTD.  We need to reach a consensus on this before the structure is
frozen.

<dt>Extend table support
<dd>The table support really is rudimentary.  This should be improved
a bit at least.

<dt>Bugs in Jade's LaTeX back-end
<dd>There's a deficiency in the &latex; back-end I added to
Jade.  There's some weakness in the way that
characters are output, which results in SDATA entities not being
processed properly.  Having discussed this with James Clark (after
submitting a `bug fix' to him, I discovered that this is in fact a
documented limitation of Jade, and that processing of SDATA entities
in this way is probably not the correct way to do this), this is not
likely to be fixed soon.
