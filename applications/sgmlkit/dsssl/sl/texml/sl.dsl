;;   This allows you to specify explicitly what the beginning and end
;;   of the environment should be.  The characteristic's value is a list
;;   consisting of two strings, the first of which is inserted at the
;;   beginning, and the second at the end, of the environment.  For
;;   example, you might specify that an element type
;;   "equation" should be transformed into a LaTeX equation
;;   via a flow object constructor such as:
;;   (element mequation
;;     (make environment brackets: '("\\[" "\\]")
;;           (process-children)))
;;
;;   "recontrol"
;;   The LaTeX generated by the back-end has line-breaks inserted to
;;   avoid the lines becoming too long.  If these are inappropriate for
;;   some reason, you can override the line-breaking by giving a value to
;;   the "recontrol" characteristic.  Its value is a string
;;   with three characters, controlling the line-breaking before, in the
;;   middle of (ie, between the "\\begin" and the environment
;;   name), and after the opening and closing of the environment.  If the
;;   corresponding character is `/' a RE is inserted at the appropriate
;;   point; if it is `-', no RE is inserted.  For example, a
;;   "verbatim" element type might be supported via:
;;   (element verbatim
;;     (make environment
;;       name: "verbatim"
;;       recontrol: "/-/"
;;       (process-children)))
;;   Thus, the "\\begin{verbatim}" and
;;   "\\end{verbatim}" will be on lines by themselves, with no
;;   RE between the "\\begin" or "\\end" and the
;;   environment name.
;;
;; For the TeXML back-end, the middle character is redundant, and ignored.
