<description>The Starlink General DTD uses the OASIS Exchange Table
Model subset of the CALS table model (see
<url>http://www.oasis-open.org/html/a503.htm</url> for discussion and
<url>http://www.oasis-open.org/html/publtext.htm</url> for public
texts).

<p>The Exchange Table Model can be customised.  The only such
customisations at present are: replace the optional TITLE element with
a required CAPTION; add implied ID and EXPORT attributes to the TABLE.
