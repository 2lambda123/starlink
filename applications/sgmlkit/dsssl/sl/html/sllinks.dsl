Support the various cross reference elements

<p>Note that, despite the intricate HyTime setup in the DTD, the
implementations here currently have the semantics built in, and
ignore the HyTime attributes!

<p>REF is a simple reference to another element in the same document.
Check that the target is a member of the list <funcname>target-element-list</>.
<p>If the target is a member of the list returned by
<funcname>section-element-list</>, then make the section reference by
calling <funcname>make-section-reference</>; otherwise, process the
target in mode <code>section-reference</>.
<p>Once we have obtained the element pointed to by the ID,
check to see if it is a <funcname>mapid</> element, and if it is,
immediately resolve the indirection.

<description>The <code>docxref</> element has a required attribute
giving the document which is to be referred to, and an optional
attribute giving an ID within that document.  The target of the link
should be a document marked up according to the <code>documentsummary</>
DTD.  In fact, that DTD is a base architecture of the Starlink General
DTD, so we could get the same effect by linking to the actual document
and extracting the <code>documentsummary</> architectural instance.
However, the <funcname>sgml-parse</> function in DSSSL isn't defined as
being able to do that; there is a Jade patch which allows it to do
that, which I hope to build into a Starlink version of Jade when I
can.

<p>In a project meeting, it was decided that there were substantial
operational difficulties in guaranteeing that document-summary
target files would always exist.  Therefore the processing of
this element was required to work even if the target element
didn't exist, by parsing the public identifier, and making
intelligent guesses about the system's environment.  This is very
messy, not least because it requires messy gymnastics in here.

<p>Initially, the generated link text could be overridden by
supplying a value for the `text' attribute.  To make this element
more consistent with the REF element, however, this has been
changed so that the element's link text is given as content to
the DOCXREF element.  The `text' attribute is still present and
supported, for (very temporary) backward compatibility, but
undocumented.

<p>Once we have obtained the element pointed to by the ID,
check to see if it is a <funcname>mapid</> element, and if it is,
immediately resolve the indirection.

<p>This rule invokes the <funcname>get-link-policy-target</> function to check
that the target of the link conforms to the policy -- if it doesn't,
it produces an <funcname>error</>.

<p>The rule uses the <code>mk-docxref</> mode to process the target element.
