<title>Maths in the Starlink DTD
<description>This DSSSL program contains code to handle the maths
elements defined in the Starlink DTD, which have content in LaTeX
notation.  The code does not attempt to do anything with the contents
-- it simply sends it to an external file, where it is processed by 
an external program, ready to be reincorporated into the generated HTML.

<p>The code here is designed to be used within another stylesheet,
such as the stylesheet which does the main processing of the document.
At the end, however, is a codegroup which will do nothing except
extract all the maths from a document.

<title>Process maths elements into GIFs
<description>Unlike the <code/code.maths.tth/ codegroup below, the
code here extracts the maths into a file ready for quite substantial
postprocessing using Perl, LaTeX, dvips, and convert, to turn the maths
fragments into GIFs (or JPEGs or PNGs, or whatever -- this code doesn't depend on the actual format).  We write out a file ready too be munged into a LaTeX 
file by a Perl script -- we use this extra step so that the Perl can try to
reuse equations wherever possible, the logic for which is probably rather
difficult in DSSSL.
<p>If there is nothing to write out, the code does not write an
empty output file. 
<p>The `interface' is the same as for the <code/tth/ version below.
<p>Changes here might need corresponding changes in make-manifest-mode in
sl.dsl
