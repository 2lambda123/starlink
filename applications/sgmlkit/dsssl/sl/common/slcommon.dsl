<title>Common functions for the Starlink stylesheets
<description>
<p>These are functions and handlers common to both the HTML and print
versions of the Starlink stylesheets.  Library functions are in another file.

<p>Note that Jade only supports the DSSSL Online subset of DSSSL, so some
more advanced features will be missing.
See:
<url>http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/dsssl/dssslo/do960816.htm</url> 
and

<routinename>make-section-reference
<description>
<p>Return a sosofo with the title of the given node,
prefixed by its section number.  If the optional argument ts is given, it
is used as the title sosofo, rather than extracting it from the node.
<p>You can generate a reference to a node either by calling this 
function with that node as argument, or by processing the node in
the <code/section-reference/ mode (which might well call this function in
turn.  In the former case, you can include keyword attributes.
<p>This function should be able to generate a reference to at least
all the functions listed in the returnvalue of function
<funcname/section-element-list/
(mmm, how about <funcname/target-element-list/?).
<p>In the body of the function, we call <funcname/process-node-list/ on the 
first child of the target node.  This is because we call this function for 
elements both within the Starlink General DTD and within the DocumentSummary
DTD.  The former has sub*sect enclosing subhead enclosing title, and the
latter has sub*sect enclosing title, and in both cases it is the title we 
wish to get at.
<p>Note that, if you specify both the <code/title/ and <code/set-prefix/
keywords, you seem to be doing all the work.  You should still call this
routine in that case, however, so that it can do any other processing
required.

true in OpenJade but not in Jade 1.2.1 (see notes at

the char-property whitespace test has to be replaced by the
brute-force version:

<routinename>index-file-name
<purpose>Return the filename of the document index.
<description>
Returns the filename to be used as entry point of the collection of
documents.  Note that this is different from the
<funcname/root-file-name/, which is a prefix applied to generated file
names.  In some cases, it might be sensible for
<funcname/index-file-name/ to simply call <funcname/root-file-name/,
but that's not what we want to do in this case.
<p>This can be generated using the
document type and DOCNUMBER if present (which need not be the case for
all document types). Another way to set this might be through a
processing-instruction.
<p>An arguably better way to obtain a root/index file name is to 
root around in the grove and find the name of the source file,
then use that information to generate the output file name.
That should be possible, and it 
almost certainly involves the SosSequence property class (cf,
HyTime A.6.1, for example, or
<url>http://www.hytime.org/materials/sgmlpropset/classes/sosseq/index.htm</url>),
which is in the `formal system identifier abstract' (fsiabs) module of the
SGML property set.  This isn't, however, implemented in Jade.

<routinename>root-file-name
<purpose>Return the filename root.
<description>
Returns the filename to be used as the `root part' of the name when
generating HTML file names.  Note that this is not the same as the
<funcname/index-file-name/, which is the name of the `index' file
which is the entry point of the collection of documents.
<p>This is also used by the LaTeX stylesheet, when generating the names
of various auxiliary files.
<p>Note that the parameter <funcname/%override-root-file-name%/ does <em/not/
override within this function, since this function is not merely used for
the name of the single root file.  See <funcname/html-file/.

<li>version number: contents of the number attribute of the last

<li>distribution id: contents of the string attribute of the last

</ul>
Each element of the list is <code/#f/ (as opposed to blank) if the
corresponding information is unavailable.

<p>If there's no history element, then the first two elements will be
the same, with the contents of the DOCDATE element, and the last

<routine>
<routinename>get-link-policy-target
<purpose>Check that the `link policy' is satisfied by a target element.
<description>This function expresses the `link policy' we wish this
stylesheet to impose on the element (in a separate document) which is
the putative target of a link.

<p>Check link policy, and return a pair.  The <code/car/ of the pair
is <code/#f/ if the policy is satisfied, and a string otherwise (this
is an error, which should be signalled with the string as an
explanation, and no link should be made); the <code/cdr/ is a string
URL giving the URL to be used, or <code/#f/ if the policy is satisfied
but no link should be made (ie, if the <code/urllinkpolicy/ is NONE).

<p>The link policy is as follows.
If the <code/documentsummary/ element's <code/exportedlinkpolicy/
has the value <code/"exportedonly"/, we may only link to targets which
have the <code/export/ attribute present and set to <code/"export"/:
that is, if we have <code/"exportedonly"/ but no <code/export/, then
the policy is trivially satisfied, but we do not return any URL.  If
the <code/documentsummary/ element's <code/urllinkpolicy/ attribute is
<code/"automatic"/, then the <code/urlpath/ attribute must not be
present, and we generate a URL based on the element's location in the
hierarchy; if it is <code/"explicit"/, the <code/urlpath/ must be
present; if it is <code/"none"/, then the policy is satisfied, but no URL
should be returned.

<p>Note that this function is designed to emit URLs as part of its response.
That is, it is partly specific to the stylesheet which generates HTML.  
The link policy, however, is <em/not/ specific to HTML, and the link with
the HTML stylesheet is only because that stylesheet is the most sophisticated
one, to which is delegated such tasks as checking the link policy by calling
this function.  For these reasons, this function should indeed be in this
common set of functions.  It may be called from the LaTeX stylesheet, however,
in which case the keyed argument <code/no-urls/ should be set true, to
prevent the function referencing the undefined (in that stylesheet)
variables <code/%starlink-document-server/ and <code/href-to/ (actually,
this fails to work, due to what may be either a bug, or
implementation-defined behaviour in Jade, so the calling file should specify
dummy values for these two variables).

<returnvalue type=pair>If <code/car/ is true, the policy has been
violated and the <code/car/ contains an error.  If <code/cdr/ is true,
then a link should be made, using the URL in <code/cdr/.

<description>
Return a list of elements which are allowable targets for a link.
This list primarily expresses those elements which this stylesheet is able
to generate a link to -- it's more to do with this stylesheet's capabilities
than with any fundamental property of the document type.

<p>This will be used when linking to (an ID attribute within) an
object which can't be linked to directly.  It doesn't matter if
there's redundancy in this -- the appropriate element is selected as
the first member of this list amongst the target element's ancestors.

<p>The link text will be generated by function
<funcname/make-section-reference/.

<p>For example, the LABEL element in the DocumentSummary DTD requires this.

<routinename>document-element
<description>
<p>Returns the document element of the document containing the given
node.
<p>Only the <code/SgmlDocument/ node class
exibits a <code/DocumentElement/ property, so to find the document element
we first have to find the grove root, which we do by examining the 
<code/grove-root/ property of the current node.  The only node which doesn't
have a <code/grove-root/ property (so that the <funcname/node-property/
routine will correctly return <code/#f/ -- ie, it exhibits the property, but
with the value <code/#f/) is the root node, but in that case,
<funcname/current-node/ returns the grove root directly (this isn't clear
from the standard -- see the discussion on `Finding the root element' in
the dssslist archive at
<url>http://www.mulberrytech.com/dsssl/dssslist/</url>).
<p>The subsequent calls to <funcname/node-property/ default <code/#f/ if 
the property is not exhibited by the node.  This catches the case where the
grove root doesn't have any <code/document-element/ property, for example if
the grove is malformed because it resulted from a call to <funcname/sgml-parse/
with a non-existent file.

<routinename>document-element-from-entity
<description>
  <p>Return the document element of the document referred to by the
  entity string passed as argument.  
  Uses <funcname/sgml-parse/: see 10179, 10.1.7.
  <p>This is <em/complicated/!  When <funcname/sgml-parse/ is called, it
  is a completely different parse from the main one.  That means that
  it has the default SGML declaration, which has <code/NAMECASE
  GENERAL NO/.  Unless we prepend the correct declaration, this isn't
  parsed properly.  The entity <funcname/%starlink-decl-entity%/ is
  defined in the General DTD to point to the declaration, and we must
  prepend this entity to the entity we have been asked to parse.  Do
  this by calling <funcname/entity-generated-system-id/ on the entity.
  <p>The crucial thing here is to realise that a `formal system identifier'
  (the argument of <funcname/sgml-parse/) is <em/not/ necessarily a
  single file.  As described in clause A.6 (specifically A.6.4.3) of
  the HyTime spec, and also on the <webref
  url='http://www.jclark.com/sp/sysid.htm' >SP pages</webref>, it can
  consist of several <em/storage object identifiers/, which are
  concatenated.  A simple filename, lacking the SOS start-tag, is an
  `informal system identifier'.

  has a CONREF default value).  If that attribute is not present, then
  the element's content is the image, and the `notation' attribute
  should be present (it is an application error if it is not).  This
