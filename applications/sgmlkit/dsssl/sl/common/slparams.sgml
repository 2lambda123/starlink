<title>Parameterisation of the DSSSL stylesheets
<description>
<p>This file collects together parameters which control various
aspects of the generation of HTML.  All the things documented as
`functions' below are really parameters.

<p>Note that a feature of Jade is that if the argument <code/-V
variable/ is given on the command line, then that variable is set to
<code/#t/, overriding any setting within the stylesheet.  The
parameters which are described as `boolean' below can be set in this
way.

<p>If you want to change any other parameters, then make a copy of the
parameter file you want to change and call it, say,
<code/params-mod.dsl/.  Modify it to suit your needs, and 
create a catalogue file in the same directory which has lines like:
<p><code>system "sl-html-parameters" "params-mod.dsl"</code>
<p>Then adjust your <code/$SGML_CATALOG_FILES/ environment variable to put
this catalogue file early in the path.  You can do the same thing for
the LaTeX parameterisation with the system identifier
<code/sl-latex-parameters/.
