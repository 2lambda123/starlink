### General DTD

Implement a FOREIGN element (Mark)
	Support such things as <foreign/et. al./

Non-sentence-ending periods (Rodney)
	Abbrev element?  nbsp entity?

LaTeX as alt format (DSB)
	Some documents could use a specialised layout for some section
	headings.  Possibly include a LaTeX-formatted element, which
	could be used as an _alternative_, but legitimately ignored.

hours and degrees elements (ACD)
	Clive even supplied SGML _and_ LaTeX to support this!

admonition (Norman/Mark)
	At same level as BLOCKQUOTE, with a couple of `class'
	attributes.  Could one of these classes be `quotation'?

bibliography within source document (prog meeting)
	Some folk don't (want to) use BibTeX, so it might be worth
	supporting bib elements within the document.

cross-references to CODECOLLECTIONs (Mark, 15 Sep)
	Mark pointed out that this is OK from within the document
	which references them, but it's not necessarily easy from
	within another document.  This is potentially rather knotty, I
	think, but it'll be quite interesting to solve.


### Programcode DTD

allow `&' in codeprologue (prog meeting) [DTD, 19 Sept]
	[ Supported in HTML DTD as of 19 Sept, but not yet in LaTeX
	(but that'll be easy) ]

programcode content modifications (Mark, and prog meeting) [DTD, 19 Sept]
	Use SST elements.  [ Supported in HTML DTD as of 19 Sept, but
	not yet in LaTeX.  Not hard, nor even particularly time-consuming. ]

shortrefs in programcode DTD (Mark)
	Shortrefs to make lists in prologues tidier.  Nice, but I'm
	always nervous of having too much cleverness in this area,
	because the more shortrefs there are, the easier it is to type
	one by accident, and so provoke a completely unintelligible
	error message.

AUTHORREF element (Mark, 14 Sept)
	`The AUTHORLIST element is a nasty example of SGML forcing one
	to write something which one otherwise wouldn't want to'.

DL/DD/DT/BLOCKQUOTE/VERBATIM/M in prologues (Mark, 14 Sept) [DTD+DC]
	Easy, I think.
	[ Implemented by restructuring the General and Programcode
	DTDs so that they both include a common set of para-level
	elements.  No additional DC support needed, since the DC
	support for the General DTD takes care of this. ]

| func opener (Mark, 3/5 Aug and Norman, 4 Aug) [DTD+DC+DOC, 19 Sept]
|	[ `opener' element named `codeopener' in DTD.  Neither DC support
|	nor documentation needed.]

### Down-converters

nested CODE elements (Mark)
	CODE elements within other elements like STRONG don't always
	come out in tt-type.

process picture environments with maths in DC (Mark)
	Should be fairly easy.  Can I do metapost at the same time?

SDATA entities (Norman/Mark)
	...are a mess.  Perhaps this should wait until I build and
	incorporate OpenJade 1.3, which has map-sdata-entity support,
	when I can do it properly.

DT element in LaTeX (Norman)
	Tweak the generated LaTeX so that {description} \item s are
	cleverer about spacing.

REF/maths in DT in LaTeX doesn't insert text (Mark, mail of 9 Sept)
	Haven't investigated

LaTeX pages are smaller than standard, and positioned differently (Mark)

KBD in VERBATIM doesn't work (Mark)

script-driven downconversion (Rodney, Mark)
	At present, this is little more than an alias for make, and so
	could probably be made more sophisticated without breaking
	anything....

Improve the tables implementation (Mark)
	This is extremely sparse at present.

TeX global declarations (Mark, 15 Sep)
	A collection of \newcommands at the head of the document.

Programcode formatting (Mark, 15 Sep)
	The results are very ugly at present.


### General

Does the Makefile work on all platforms? (Mark, 16 Aug)
	I havn't checked this (and the Tru64 make is so crappy that
	the answer is almost certainly `no'), but the point is moot at
	the moment, as Jade builds only on the Linux boxes.  By the
	time this becomes live, we might be running Linux on the
	alphas, too!

Document templates (Mark, 15 Sep)
	`Some hints and tips, in the form of examples, might be useful
	too (for instance creative use of entities)'.  Oooh, I don't
	know we ought to be encouraging `creative' use of entities....

# Local Variables:
# mode:text
# fill-prefix: "	"
