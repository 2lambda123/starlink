      SUBROUTINE FWORD( STRING, POS, WORD, WLEN )
*+
* Name:
*     FWORD

*  Purpose:
*     Find a given word within a string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FWORD( STRING, POS, WORD, WLEN )

*  Description:
*     The word within STRING with the position specified by POS is found
*     and returned in WORD (or as much of it as there is room for). Its
*     length is returned in WLEN. 
*
*     A word is a group of contiguous non-blank (or tab) characters.
*     Blanks contained within single quotes are not treated as word
*     delimiters. Quotes, spaces and "\" characters can be escaped 
*     using the "\" character if they need to be included literally within 
*     a word (the escape characters are not included in the returned word).
      
*  Arguments:
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The string.
*     POS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the required word. WLEN is returned equal to zero
*        if no word exists with the given index.
*     WORD = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The required word extracted from STRING.
*     WLEN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index of the last character in the word.
