      SUBROUTINE AXMAT( N, AXIS, DATA, NGOOD, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    AXMAT

*  Purpose:
*     Fill a data array with flux values with matching axis values

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AXMAT( N, AXIS, DATA, NGOOD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An array of axis values is supplied. Elements from the internal
*     FLUX array which have WAVE values which match any of these axis
*     values are placed in the corresponding elements of the output
*     DATA array. The algorithm used will allow the axis values to
*     increase or decrease with pixel number (in fact they need not
*     even be monotonic).  However, the alogorithm is faster if the
*     axis values are monotonic increasing.
*
*     Axis values are considered to match if the fractional difference
*     between them is no more than the machine precision for single
*     precision floating point values.
*     
*     Elements of the DATA array which do not correspond to any element
*     in the internal arrays are set bad (i.e. equal to VAL__BADR).
      
*  Arguments:
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the DATA and AXIS arrays.
*     AXIS( N ) = REAL (Given)
*        The axis value (i.e. wavelength, velocity, etc) at each element
*        of the DATA array.
*     DATA( N ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The array holding the flux values.
*     NGOOD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of elements in the returned data array which are not
*        set to VAL__BADR.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  current input element is the first element in the high end section
*  (i.e. index J0). If this guess turns out to be wrong, then the rest
*  of the high end section is searched until a matching axis value is

*  same as the axis value of the current element of the internal arrays
*  (to within a relative error given by the machine precision, VAL__EPSR), 
*  then increment the count of good values in the data array (so long as
*  a value has not already been stored in theis output pixel), store the
*  current internal flux value in the output data array, indicate that
*  the most likely place for the next match is the next pixel (this
*  assumes the axis values are monotonic increasing), and jump out of
*  the loop to do the next element of the internal arrays. Ignore bad 
*  axis values.
