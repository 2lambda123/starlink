      SUBROUTINE WRITE( COMM, PARAMS, WORV, TITLE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     WRITE

*  Purpose:
*     Implements the DIPSO command WRITE.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL WRITE( COMM, PARAMS, WORV, TITLE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The WRITE command writes the contents of the current arrays
*     to an NDF. The first command parameter is the name of the output
*     NDF, and is mandatory. The second command parameter is the name of
*     a model NDF, and is optional.
*
*     If no model NDF is supplied, a 1-dimensional output NDF is created
*     with lower bound set to 1 and upper bound set to the number of
*     values in the current arrays. The FLUX values are copied to the
*     DATA array, and the WAVE values are copied to the AXIS CENTRE
*     array for axis 1. A DIPSO_EXTRA extension is created holding the
*     break array and the WORV value. The supplied title is stored in
*     the NDF, the current X label is stored as the label for axis 1,
*     and the current Y label is stored as the NDF label.
*
*     If a model NDF is given then the output NDF is created by copying
*     the model NDF. The FLUX values stored in common are then written
*     into the DATA array. The position of each FLUX value in the DATA
*     array is determined by matching the wavelength value stored in
*     common with the NDFs AXIS CENTRE values (an error is reported if
*     there is no overlap or if the model NDF is not 1 dimensional).
*     None of the other attributes or components of the output NDF are
*     changed and so they retain the values copied from the model
*     NDF. No DIPSO_EXTRA extension is put into the output NDF (it may
*     already have one of course, copied from the model NDF).

*  Arguments:
*     COMM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the command which invoked this routine. This will
*        usually be "WRITE", but could conceivably be something else
*        ("EXIT" for instance).
*     PARAMS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Any text supplied by the user on the command line following the
*        command name.
*     WORV = REAL (Given)
*        The "wavelength or velocity" value.
*     TITLE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The title.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
