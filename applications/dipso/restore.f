      SUBROUTINE RESTORE( COMM, PARAMS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     RESTORE

*  Purpose:
*     Implements the DIPSO command RESTORE.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RESTORE( COMM, PARAMS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The RESTORE command reads the contents of an NDF created by the
*     SAVE or EXIT commands, and puts the read data onto the stack.

*  Arguments:
*     COMM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the command which invoked this routine. This will
*        usually be "RESTORE".
*     PARAMS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Any text supplied by the user on the command line following the
*        command name.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     22-AUG-1994 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     13-DEC-1995 (DSB):
*        Remove LOC argument from GETNDF call. This argument returned a
*        primary locator to keep the file open, but the NDF library now 
*        looks after it all.
