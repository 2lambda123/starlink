      SUBROUTINE CMATCH( CLIST, RLIST, MATCH )
*+
*  Name:
*     CMATCH

*  Purpose:
*     See if a command matches required classifications

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CMATCH( CLIST, RLIST, MATCH )

*  Description:
*     Each command belongs to one or more classes. Each class is
*     identified by a single lower-case letter. The CLIST argument
*     should hold a single word made up of the identifiers for all the
*     classes to which the current command belongs. The MATCH argument
*     is returned .TRUE. if the classification of the current command
*     matches the required classification supplied in argument RLIST.
*
*     RLIST can consists of one or more words, each word being a list of
*     of class identifiers. The current command must belong to all the
*     classes in at least one of these words to produce a match. Classes
*     can be nagated (i.e. explicitly excluded) by specifying an upper
*     case identifier (i.e. "A" means "not in class 'a'").

*  Arguments:
*     CLIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The list of class identifiers to which the current command
*        belongs.
*     RLIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A string specifying the classes required for matching commands.
*     MATCH = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Returned .TRUE. if the current command matches the required
*        classification. Returned .FALSE. otherwise.

*  Initialise the return flag to indicate that no match has been found.
      MATCH = .FALSE.
      
*  Loop until all the class combinations have been checked, or a
*  match has been found.
      DO WHILE( LRLIST .NE. ' ' .AND. .NOT. MATCH )

*  Find the end of the first word.  Ignore any bad status value set by
*  CHR_FIWE (CHR does not use ERR and so ERR_ANNUL need not be called).

*  If the null class is specified, all commands are selected.

               IF( C .LE. 'Z' ) THEN

*  If the command belongs to the specified class, then it does not
*  match. There is then no point in checking the remaining class, so
*  jump out of the loop.

*  If this is a non-negated class, get the upper case equivalent.
               ELSE
                  CALL CHR_UCASE( C )

*  If the command does not belongs to the specified class, then it does
