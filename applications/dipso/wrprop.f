      SUBROUTINE WRPROP( NDFNAM, INDFM, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*     WRPROP

*  Purpose:
*     Copy the internal FLUX values to an output NDF, basing the NDF on
*     a supplied model NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL WRPROP( NDFNAM, INDFM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An output NDF is created by copying the supplied model NDF. The
*     values in the internal FLUX array are then stored in the output
*     DATA array. The position at which each flux value is stored in
*     the output DATA array is determined by the values in the internal
*     WAVE array and the values in the AXIS CENTRE array for axis 1 of
*     the NDF.  FLUX values are stored at the pixel for which the AXIS
*     CENTRE value matches the internal WAVE value. An error is
*     reported if there is no overlap between the AXIS CENTRE values
*     and the WAVE values. An error is also reported if the NDF is not
*     1-dimensional.
*
*     Only the DATA component of the output NDF is set by this routine. 
*     The shape of the NDF and all other components (AXIS, TITLE, all
*     extensions, etc) are inherited from the model NDF.
      
*  Arguments:
*     NDFNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the NDF structure.
*     INDFM = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the model NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
