      SUBROUTINE XHELP( SHOWME, HLPSTR, OK, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     XHELP

*  Purpose:
*     Issue hypertext help

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL XHELP( SHOWME, HLPSTR, OK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An attempt is made to issue hypertext help so long as OK is
*     supplied .TRUE.. If the environment variable DISPLAY is not
*     defined, no hypertext help is issued and OK is returned .FALSE.
*     (although no error is reported). Otherwise, the SHOWME command is
*     used to access the hypertext version of SUN/50. The supplied help
*     string is used as a label within SUN/50, to which a jump is made.

*  Arguments:
*     SHOWME = CHARACTER (Given)
*        A string holding a bourne shell command which will run the
*        Starlink 'showme' command.
*     HLPSTR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The help string. Returned in upper case.
*     OK = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        If supplied .FALSE. an immediate return is made. Otherwise, OK
*        is returned set to .FALSE. if hypertext help could not be
*        issued.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
