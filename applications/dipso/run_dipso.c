/*+
*  Name:
*     run_dipso

*  Purpose:
*     Sets up signal handling and runs the dipso main routine.
 
*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Description:
*     This function sets up handlers for floating point exception (SIGFPE),
*     access violatyions (SIGSEGV), and interupt (SIGINT) signals, and then 
*     activates the main dipso Fortran subroutine. The signal handling is 
*     done is C because there seems to be no way of doing a long jump in 
*     fortran (i.e. a GOTO from one subroutine back to a place in a higher 
*     level subroutine). The standard C library functions "longjmp" and 
*     "setjmp" are therefore used for this purpose. There is a restriction on 
*     the use of these library functions in that the function into which the 
*     jump is to be made must still be active at the time of the jump (i.e. it 
*     must not have returned). The only place to put a function so that it is 
*     guaranteed not to have returned is at the very top level (the dipso.f 
*     routine would have done were it not for the fact that the destination of 
*     the jump must be written in C). For this reason, it is necessary to put 
*     a C layer on top of the main dipso subroutine.

*  Notes:
*     -  To produce the executable, this function must first be compiled
*     to produce an object module ("cc -c run_dipso.c"), and then linked in
*     with the other dipso fortran routines using f77 ("f77 -o dipso 
*     run_dipso.o dipso.f ...").
