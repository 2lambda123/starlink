 This is a repository for files containing Stellar Atmosphere Models,
 which can be accessed by DIPSO [SUN 50], for example.

 The principal grid consists of Kurucz model atmospheres for a solar
 composition calculated by using ATLAS9 (Kurucz 1991, 'Precision Photometry:
 Astrophysics of the Galaxy', eds Davis Philip, Upgren & Janes, L Davis Press,
 Schenectady), and was obtained through CCP7.

 Further grids consist of many models calculated by A.E. Lynas-Gray, with 
 contributions from other astronomers at UCL.  One grid contains all models
 contained in Kurucz's 1979 paper (ApJ Sup 40, 1), using ATLAS6, together with 
 others calculated on a largely ad hoc basis at UCL. The Kurucz ATLAS6 models 
 may differ very slightly from the published models, as they were recalculated
 with a code in which several bugs were corrected, and with more
 stringent convergence criteria than Kurucz used. The low metallicity grid
 ("SMC" mixture) was published by Howarth & Lynas-Gray (1989, MNRAS 240, 513).

 Examples of how each model should be read into DIPSO are shown for each
 grid, assuming that astrophysical fluxes are required.

 ATLAS9  models:
 ===============

 F(Teff).(LogG*10)   ---  Files containing Kurucz (ATLAS9) plane-parallel
                          model fluxes with normal abundances.The files are
                          UNFORMATTED. Data are tabulated as wavelength
                          and astrophysical flux.

 ATLAS6  models:
 ===============

 K(Teff).(LogG*100)  ---  Files containing Kurucz (ATLAS6) plane-parallel
                          model fluxes with normal abundances.The files are
                          UNFORMATTED. Data are tabulated as wavelength
                          and astrophysical flux.

 KLO(Teff).(LogG*100)  -  As above, but metal abundances are solar/30.

 S(Teff).G(LogG*10)  ---  As above, but 0.1*solar metals ("SMC"),
                          and `real' (not astrohpysical) fluxes.
