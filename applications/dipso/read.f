      SUBROUTINE READ( COMM, PARAMS, WORV, TITLE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     READ

*  Purpose:
*     Implements the DIPSO command READ.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL READ( COMM, PARAMS, WORV, TITLE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The READ command reads the contents of an NDF into the current
*     arrays.

*  Arguments:
*     COMM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the command which invoked this routine. This will
*        usually be "READ".
*     PARAMS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Any text supplied by the user on the command line following the
*        command name.
*     WORV = REAL (Returned)
*        The "wavelength or velocity" value for the NDF.
*     TITLE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The NDF title, or blank if the NDF has no title.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the X units are km/s, WORV is the rest wavelength (in
*     Angstroms) to which the velocities are referenced, divided by
*     he speed of light (in km/s). If the X units are not km/s, then
*     WORV will be set to 1.0.

*     23-AUG-1994 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     13-DEC-1995 (DSB):
*        Remove LOC argument from GETNDF call. This argument returned a
*        primary locator to keep the file open, but the NDF library now 
*        looks after it all.
