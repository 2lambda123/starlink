#  Name:
#     nfi.awk

#  Purpose:
#     Edits the NDF_FORMATS_IN to a list of file extensions.

#  Language:
#     AWK script

#  Type of Module:
#     awk script

#  Description:
#     This script extracts the list of file extensions in order
#     from the environment variable NDF_FORMATS_IN, and prints out the
#     number of formats and the file extensions in a space-separated
#     list.  When NDF_FORMATS_IN is undefined, the script prints 0.

#  Usage:
#     printenv | grep NDF_FORMATS_IN | awk -f nfi.awk
