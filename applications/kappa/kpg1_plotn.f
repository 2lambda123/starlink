      SUBROUTINE KPG1_PLOTN( IWCS, DOMAIN, IPICD, QUIET, IPLOT, NFRM, 
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_PLOTN

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new DATA picture and ensure there is an AST Plot for it.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_PLOTN( IWCS, DOMAIN, IPICD, IPLOT, NFRM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine createa an AST Plot describing a given DATA picture.
*     If a FrameSet is supplied (IWCS), then it is merged with the
*     Plot. An error is reported if the FrameSet and Plot cannot be
*     aligned.
*
*     On exit, the current PGPLOT viewport corresponds to area occupied by
*     the DATA picture. The bounds of the PGPLOT window produce a world 
*     co-ordinate system within the viewport corresponding to the Base 
*     Frame in the returned Plot (i.e. millimetres from the bottom left 
*     corner of the view surface - NOT pixel coordinates). Note, this is
*     different to the world co-ordinate system stored in the AGI database 
*     with the DATA picture.

*  Arguments:
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to a FrameSet. This may be AST__NULL. The Current
*        and Base Frames are unchanged on exit.
*     DOMAIN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The Domain in which AGI world co-ordinates within the specified
*        DATA picture live. Alignment of the Plot and FrameSet will be 
*        attampted in this Domain if it is not possible in the Current
*        Frame of the FrameSet.
*     IPICD = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AGI identifier for the DATA picture.
*     QUIET = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Suppress message identifying the Domain in which alignment occurs?
*     IPLOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AST pointer to the new Plot. Returned equal to AST__NULL if
*        an error occurs. 
*     NFRM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A  Frame with index I in the supplied FrameSet (IWCS) will have index
*        ( I + NFRM ) in the returned Plot (IPLOT). Returned equal to zero
*        if an error occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  If the DATA picture does not have a Plot stored with it, KPG1_GDGET
*  will create a default Plot containing a GRAPHIS Frame, and a Frame
*  corresponding to AGI world co-ordinates. The AGI world co-ordinate 
*  Frame is normally just a default 2-D Frame with Domain AGI_WORLD, but
*  we can over-ride this by supplying an alternative Frame containing
*  more appropriate attribute settings. If we do not know the Domain of the
*  AGI world co-ordinate system, just use the default Frame. This is
*  indicated by setting the FRM pointer to AST__NULL.
