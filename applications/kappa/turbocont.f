      SUBROUTINE TURBOCONT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TURBOCONT

*  Purpose:
*     Contours a 2-d NDF quickly.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation
*     CALL TURBOCONT( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This application draws a contour plot of a 2-dimensional NDF on
*     the current graphics device via an efficient algorithm.  The
*     image may be part or whole of the data array, but also the
*     variance or quality can be shown.  The plot is situated within
*     the current graphics-database picture.

*     The contour plot resides within optional, annotated and enumerated
*     axes.  An optional, but recommended, key may be drawn to the
*     right of the contour plot.  It reports the NDF's units if there
*     are any, and only contour heights actually plotted are included.
*     There are seven methods for selecting contours.

*  Usage:
*     turbocont ndf [comp] mode ncont [key] [device] 
*        { firstcnt=? stepcnt=?
*        { heights=?
*        { percentiles=?
*        mode

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ABSLAB  =  LITERAL (Read)
*        Label for the plot abscissa, in which NCAR fancy founts may be
*        embedded when FONT = "NCAR".  If axis information is present
*        the suggested default is the NDF's axis label followed by the
*        units, in parentheses.  If an error occurs obtaining the label
*        the suggested default is "X". []
*     ANNOTA = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE the contour lines will be annotated with a contour
*        number corresponding to the key entry.  It is ignored and there
*        are no annotations when KEY = FALSE.  [FALSE]
*     AXES = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if labelled and annotated axes are to be drawn around the
*        contour plot.  The annotations are either the data
*        co-ordinates from the NDF axis components, provided these are
*        present and linear and COSYS = "Data"; otherwise pixel
*        co-ordinates are used.  [TRUE]
*     BORDER = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        BORDER is TRUE if a box is to be drawn about the contour plot.
*        This is only accessed when there are no axes required. [TRUE]
*     CLEAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the graphics device is to be cleared before display
*        of the array. [TRUE]
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The NDF component to be contoured.  It may be "Data",
*        "Quality", "Variance", or "Error" (where "Error" is the
*        alternative to "Variance" and causes the square root of the
*        variance values to be taken before plotting contours).  If
*        "Quality" is specified, then the quality values are treated as
*        numerical values (in the range 0 to 255). ["Data"]
*     CONCOL = LITERAL (Read)
*        The colour of the contour lines on devices that support colour.
*        The options are described below.
*
*          "MAX"          - The maximum colour index in the image 
*                           display colour lookup table.
*          "MIN"          - The minimum (non-reserved) colour index in 
*                           the image-display colour lookup table.
*          An integer     - The actual colour index.  It is constrained
*                           between 0 and the maximum colour index
*                           available on the device. 
*          A named colour - Uses the named colour from the palette, and
*                           if it is not present, the nearest colour
*                           from the palette is selected.
*
*        If the colour is to remain unaltered as the lookup table is
*        manipulated choose an integer between 0 and 15, or a named
*        colour.  This parameter will be ignored if PENROT = TRUE.
*        [The current value, but equals "1" (the foreground colour) if
*        there is no current value.] 
*     COSYS = LITERAL (Read)
*        The co-ordinate system to be used.  This can be either "World"
*        or "Data".  "World" makes pixel co-ordinates to appear on axes.
*        If COSYS = "Data" the NDF's axis information is used to
*        annotate axes.  [Current co-ordinate system]
*     DASHED = _REAL (Read)
*        The height below which the contours will be drawn with dashed
*        lines.  A null value (!) means all contours are drawn with
*        solid lines.  This facility is only available when ANNOTA =
*        FALSE. [!]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The plotting device. [Current image-display device]
*     FILL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        The contour plot normally has square pixels, in other words
*        a length along each axis corresponds to the same number of
*        pixels.  However, for images with markedly different
*        dimensions this default behaviour may not be suitable or give
*        the clearest plot.  When FILL is TRUE, the square-pixel
*        constraint is relaxed and the contour plot is the largest
*        possible within the current picture.  When FILL is FALSE, the
*        pixels are square.  The suggested default is the current value.
*        [FALSE]
*     FIRSTCNT = _REAL (Read)
*        Height of the first contour (Linear and Magnitude modes).
*        The suggested value is the current value.
*     FONT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The fount to be used for the line graphics.  It can be either
*        "NCAR" for the NCAR fancy characters and "GKS" for the standard
*        GKS san-serif fount.  The former is intended for hardcopy
*        publication-quality plots, since it is relatively slow; the
*        latter is intended for normal interactive graphics requiring
*        rapid plotting, and it is clearer on small plots.  The
*        suggested default is the current value. ["GKS"]
*     HEIGHTS() = _REAL (Read)
*        Contour levels (Free mode).  The suggested default is the
*        current value.
*     KEY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        When KEY is TRUE, a key of the contour level versus pixel
*        value is to be produced. [TRUE]
*     LABELFREQ = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The frequency with which contour levels are annotated.  1
*        means every level will be labelled.  This may be excessive in
*        plots where the contours are closely packed.  This parameter
*        is ignored unless contour annotation has been selected.  It
*        must be between one and the number of contour heights. [1]
*     MAJTIC( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The parameter controlling the numbers of major tick marks
*        for the x and y axes.  (Number used is between MAJTIC+2 and
*        5*MAJTIC/2+4.) [3.,3.]
*     MAXRES = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE the contours are interpolated to the resolution of the
*        plotting device, i.e. provides sub-pixel resolution, otherwise
*        straight-line segments at pixel resolution are drawn.  The
*        latter does not give smooth contours, but this makes the
*        processing much faster.  The former draws smoother contours to
*        the resolution of the graphics workstation, but they still
*        have vertices.  If you require smooth well-rounded contours try
*        the slower CONTOUR. [FALSE]
*     MINTIC( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The number of minor tick marks between each major tick mark
*        for the x and y axes.  A negative value forces the graphics
*        package to compute appropriate values. [-1.,-1.]
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The method used to select the contour levels.  The options are
*        described below.
*
*          "Area"        - The contours enclose areas of the array for
*                          which the equivalent radius increases by
*                          equal increments.  You specify the number of
*                          levels.
*          "Automatic"   - The contour levels are equally spaced between
*                          the maximum and minimum pixel values in the
*                          array.  You supply the number of contour
*                          levels.
*          "Equalised"   - You define the number of equally spaced
*                          percentiles.
*          "Free"        - You specify a series of contour values
*                          explicitly.
*          "Linear"      - You define the number of contours, the start
*                          contour level and linear step between
*                          contours.
*          "Magnitude"   - You define the number of contours, the start
*                          contour level and step between contours.  The
*                          step size is in magnitudes so the nth contour
*                          is dex(-0.4*(n-1)*step) times the start
*                          contour level.
*          "Percentiles" - You specify a series of percentiles.
*
*        The suggested default is the current value, which is initially
*        "Free".
*     NCONT = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of contours required (all modes except Free and
*        Percentiles).  It must be between 1 and 50.  If the number is
*        large, the plot may be cluttered and take longer to produce.
*        6, the initial suggested default, gives reasonable results.
*        The current value becomes the suggested default.
*     NDF = NDF (Read)
*        NDF structure containing the 2-dimensional image to be
*        contoured.
*     NOISY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE the contour lines will alternately be annotated with
*        a contour number corresponding to the key entry, but at
*        twice the frequency.  It is ignored unless annotated contours
*        have been selected. [FALSE]
*     ORDLAB  =  LITERAL (Read)
*        Label for the plot ordinate, in which NCAR fancy founts may be
*        embedded when FONT = "NCAR".  If axis information is present
*        the suggested default is the NDF's axis label followed by the
*        units, in parentheses.  If an error occurs obtaining the label
*        the suggested default is "Y". []
*     OUTTIC = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the axis tick marks are to appear on the outside of
*        the axes instead of inside.  By default, the tick marks are
*        drawn outside the contouring region to eliminate
*        intersections of ticks with the contours. [TRUE]
*     PENROT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the plotting pens are cycled through the contours to
*        aid identification of the contour heights.  It is ignored
*        when annotation is selected. [FALSE]
*     PERCENTILES() = _REAL (Read)
*        Contour levels given as percentiles.  The values must lie
*        between 0.0 and 100.0. (Percentiles mode).  The suggested
*        default is the current value.
*     PLTITL = LITERAL (Read)
*        The title of the plot.  Up to about 40 characters can be
*        accommodated, and NCAR fancy founts may be embedded when FONT =
*        "NCAR".  If an error occurs obtaining the title, it is
*        defaulted to "Contour plot".  [The NDF title]
*     PXSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The length (x axis) of the plot in metres.  There is an upper
*        limit given by the x size of the current picture. [Maximum that
*        can fit in the current picture whilst preserving square pixels]
*     PYSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The length (y axis) of the plot in metres.  There is an upper
*        limit given by the y size of the current picture. [Maximum that
*        can fit in the current picture whilst preserving square pixels]
*     RESOLUTION = _REAL (Read)
*        The resolution factor.  The actual plotting resolution is this
*        times the x and y theoretical resolutions in world
*        co-ordinates.  In GKS, whether or not a given "lamp" is
*        illuminated or pen position is marked with ink cannot be
*        determined, so a factor of unity is too small for the most
*        efficient processing.  It must lie between 2.0 and 10.0. [2.0]
*     STEPCNT = _REAL (Read)
*        Separation between contour levels, linear for Linear mode
*        and in magnitudes for Magnitude mode.  The suggested value is
*        the current value.
*     THICK = _REAL (Read)
*        The thickness of the lines and NCAR-fount characters in the
*        plot, where 1.0 is the normal thickness.  Currently, this is
*        only available on a few devices.  It must take a value in the
*        range 0.5--10.0.  [1.0]

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Examples:
*     turbocont myfile d \
*        Contours the data array in the NDF called myfile on the current
*        graphics device.  All other settings are defaulted, so for
*        example the current method for determining heights is used, and
*        a key is plotted.
*     turbocont taurus1(100:199,150:269,4) \
*        Contours a 2-dimensional portion of current array component in
*        the NDF cube called taurus1 on the current graphics device.
*        The portion extends from pixel (100,150,4) to pixel
*        (199,269,4).  All other settings are defaulted, so for example
*        coarse contours are drawn, using the current mode for
*        determining heights, and a key is plotted.
*     turbocont ndf=ngc6872 mode=au ncont=5 device=ps_l concol=white
*        Contours the data array in the NDF called ngc6872 on the
*        ps_l graphics device.  Five equally spaced contours between
*        the maximum and minimum data values are drawn in white.  The
*        NDF's title adorns the plot.  A key is plotted.
*     turbocont ngc6872 mode=au ncont=5 annota labelfreq=2 cosys=w
*     device=ps_l concol=white
*        As above.  In addition the contours are annotated at
*        alternate heights.  The axes are annotated with pixel
*        co-ordinates.
*     turbocont ngc6872 mode=li firstcnt=10 stepcnt=2 ncont=4 noaxes
*        Contours the data array in the NDF called ngc6872 on the
*        current graphics device.  Four contours at heights 10, 12, 14,
*        and 16 are drawn.  A key is plotted, but no axes surround the
*        contour plot.
*     turbocont ss443 mode=pe percentiles=[80,90,95,98,99,99.9] annota
*        Contours the data array in the NDF called ss443 on the
*        current graphics device.  Annotated contours at heights
*        corresponding to the 80, 90, 95, 98, 99, and 99.9 percentiles
*        are drawn.  A key is plotted.
*     turbocont mode=eq ncont=5 dashed=0 pencol=red ndf=skyflux
*        Contours the data array in the NDF called skyflux on the
*        current graphics device.  Contours at heights corresponding to
*        the 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 percentiles are drawn in red.  Those
*        contours whose values are negative will appear as dashed
*        lines.  A key is plotted.
*     turbocont comp=d nokey penrot \
*        Contours the portion of the data array in the current NDF on
*        the current graphics device using the current method for height
*        selection.  The NDF's title adorns the plot.  No key is drawn.
*        The appearance of the contours cycles every third contour.
*     turbocont comp=v mode=fr heights=[10,20,40,80] title=Variance
*        Contours the variance array in the current NDF on the
*        current graphics device.  Contours at 10, 20, 40 and 80 are
*        drawn.  "Variance" is the title of the plot.

*  Notes:
*     -  The application stores a number of pictures in the graphics
*     database in the following order: a FRAME of the specified size
*     containing the title, annotated axes, contours and key; a DATA
*     picture which is stored with world co-ordinates in units of data
*     pixels; and a KEY picture to store the key if present.  The DATA
*     picture also may have double-precision data co-ordinates derived
*     from the NDF axis components provided these are linear and
*     different from pixel co-ordinates; the data co-ordinates are
*     stored via a linear transformation.  The NDF associated with the
*     plot is stored by reference with the DATA picture.  On exit the
*     current database picture for the chosen device reverts to the
*     input picture.
*     -  There are some options for setting the characteristics of the
*     contour lines.  By default, solid lines are drawn with the same
*     colour as the axes and key, namely the foreground colour.  The
*     colour will depend on the graphics device chosen, but it is often
*     black for printers or white for terminals.  The alternatives to
*     override this default behaviour are listed below.
*
*        1. Set a colour for all contours using parameter CONCOL.
*        2. Request dashed contours below some threshold given by
*           parameter DASHED and solid lines for other heights.  All
*           contours have either the foreground colour or that
*           prescribed by parameter CONCOL.
*        3. Cycle the pens modulo 3 for each contour height actually
*           plotted by setting PENROT = TRUE.  The characteristics of
*           the second and third line styles will depend on the chosen
*           graphics device.  An image display or pen plotter will draw
*           coloured lines using palette entries 1 to 3; whereas a
*           window overlay, or monochrome laser printer or terminal
*           will draw a variety of dashed or thicker lines.
*        4. Combine options 2 and 3.  However, palette colours 1 to 3
*           will always be used and CONCOL ignored.  The contours below
*           the threshold continue the cycle through the three colours.
*           There may be some confusion on devices that already use
*           dashed lines, so this is only suitable for devices
*           supporting at least three colours simultaneously.
*        5. Annotate the contours using the number of the contour height
*           corresponding to the key entries rather than the values
*           themselves.  (Set parameter ANNOTA = TRUE.)  The frequency
*           of labelling may be defined (LABELFREQ).  The key option
*           must be chosen (KEY = TRUE) in conjunction with annotated
*           contours.  Annotation is not recommended should the data
*           array have a large number of bad pixels, or if the contours
*           are closely packed.  There is an additional parameter
*           (NOISY) to select double annotations for short or noisy
*           contours in option 2.
*
*     Annotation takes precedence over pen rotation, which in turn
*     overrides colour control through CONCOL. 
*  Algorithm:
*     -  Find which component to display, obtain an identifier to the
*     NDF and check that the component is present.  Find the data type
*     for processing.  Get the NDF bounds and inquire the bad-pixel
*     flag.  Get the units.  Obtain the sub-image bounds.  Create and
*     the section.  Determine which co-ordinate system to use.
*     -  Get the display device and open the database for it with the
*     appropriate device status.  Get the current SGS zone.
*     -  Save the frame picture in the database.
*     -  Obtain the plotting style, title, axis labels and plot size.
*     -  Create a new zone of the requested size.
*     -  Define frame, image and key zones.
*     -  Select the contour heights and sort them in ascending order.
*     -  Get the contour-style parameters.
*     -  Obtain the data co-ordinate transformation and axis bounds.
*     -  Draw axes in a smaller than default NCAR zone or a box in the
*     full image zone.
*     -  Find the position of the top of the key.
*     -  Obtain lots of work arrays, redefine the co-ordinates to that
*     of the image and plot the contours in the NCAR grid region.  Clear
*     workspace.  Store the image picture in the database, plus the data
*     reference, and the transformation for data co-ordinates.
*     -  Draw the key, recording it in the database and report the
*     heights.
*     -  Tidy graphics and NDF.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  Only real data can be processed directly.  Other non-complex
*     numeric data types will undergo a type conversion before the
*     contour plot is drawn.
*     -  Bad pixels and automatic quality masking are supported.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Lots of missing options to tailor the plot.  NCAR does strange
*     things if the picture is too small.  A method to circumvent the
*     problem is being investigated.
