      SUBROUTINE CNTSBP( CELABL, CELABR, CELATR, CELATL, CELFRA, CLEVEL,
     :                   XOFF, YOFF, ENTER, DX, DY, DIM1, DIM2, NPTS,
     :                   XP, YP, STATUS )
*
*    Description :
*
*     The routine follows a contour in a notional sub-pixel array, via
*     linear interpolation of a full-pixel cell.  The centres of the
*     corner sub-pixels are the centres of the full-sized pixels in the
*     contour cell. The routine updates the locus of points only when
*     the increment from the last point is greater than defined x,y
*     resolutions.
*
*     The quality of output is not good, especially if a pair of corners
*     are equal to the contour height.  A smoothing algorithm is better
*     and will replace this routine at the next release.
*
*    Invocation :
*
*     CALL CNTSBP( CELABL, CELABR, CELATR, CELATL, CELFRA, CLEVEL,
*    :             XOFF, YOFF, ENTER, DX, DY, DIM1, DIM2, NPTS,

*           segments longer than this will be plotted.
*     DY = REAL( READ )
*         The y resolution of the contour segments, i.e. only contour
*           segments longer than this will be plotted.

*     XP( * ) = REAL( READ, WRITE )
*         Work array to store the contour locus, x positions
*     YP( * ) = REAL( READ, WRITE )
*         Work array to store the contour locus, y positions
*     STATUS  = INTEGER( READ )
*         Global status value
*
*    Method :
*
*     Check inherited status
*     Find the sub-pixel cell from which to start tracing the contour
*       given the entrance cell
*     Compute the fractional co-ordinates of the sub-cell pixels
*     Linearly interpolate to compute the sub-array pixel values
*     Determine which edges of the sub-cell are crossed by a contour, 
*       excluding the entrance side
*     If at least one cell edge is crossed then
*        Initialise variables
*        Loop to follow the contour
*           For each side the contour crosses compute the fractional
*             position of the intersection along that side, and store
*             possible exit sides
*           If all four edges of the cell are crossed then
*              Make sure sides connected by the contours do in fact do
*                so by swapping the co-ordinates (two cases, one caused
*                by the ordering of the searching of the sides, and the
*                second uses triangular contouring to decide)
*           Endif
*           Initialise the last-contour point stored if this is the
*             start of the following the contour within the cell
*           If the segment is longer than the plotting resolution then
*              Store the point and update the last stored point
*           Endif
*           Record that contour tracking has started and side it left
*             the sub-cell
*           For a given exit side shift the X or Y position by a
*             sub-pixel, exiting the contour-tracking loop if the
*             sub-cell lies outside the full-size cell. Compute the new
*             sub-cell pixel values by linear interpolation, then
*             determine which sides the contour crosses excluding the
*             side it entered
*        Endfor
*     Endif
*     End
