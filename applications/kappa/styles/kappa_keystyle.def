#  Name:
#     kappa_keystyle.def

#  Purpose:
#     Defines the default style for keys produced by KAPPA applications.

#  Description:
#     This file contains default settings for plotting style attributes
#     which are used when drawing a key. These defaults can be over-ridden 
#     by the user by supplying a value for the KEYSTYLE parameter when 
#     running the applications. Individual applications may have
#     alternative defaults files (eg see kappa_linplot_keystyle.def).

#  Notes:
#     -  Always include attribute axis qualifiers, etc, explicitly in this
#     file.  For instance, say "textlab(1)=1" and "textlab(2)=1" instead of
#     just "textlab=1".
