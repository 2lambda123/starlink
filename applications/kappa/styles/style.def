#  Name:
#     kappa.sty

#  Purpose:
#     An example of a file containing a description of a coloured
#     plotting style which can be used for day-to-day work by KAPPA 
#     graphical application.

#  Description:
#     KAPPA graphical applications such as CONTOUR, DISPLAY, etc, allow
#     the appearance of certain parts of the plot (annotated axes,
#     contours, keys, etc) to be specified using a text file containing 
#     settings for plotting attributes. The name of such a file can be
#     supplied for the relevant application parameter. For instance, the
#     STYLE parameter is usually used to specify the appearance of
#     annotated axes.
#
#     This file is an example of the way in which this facility can be
#     used. It contains general settings which could be applicable for 
#     any data plot. Data-specific versions could be produced by editing
#     copies of this file to include such things as the title to be
#     displayed at the top of the plot (using the Title attribute), or 
#     the format for numerical axis labels (using the Format or Digits
#     attributes).
#
#     This file produces a coloued plotting style suitable for day-to-day
#     work. The file $KAPPA_DE/pub.sty produces a plotting style more 
#     suited to publications.

#  Example:
#     display style=$KAPPA_DIR/style.def
#        This runs the DISPLAY application, creating annotated axes with
#        the appearance specified in this file. Note, subsequent
#        invocations of DISPLAY will use the same file until a new value
#        is assigned to parameter STYLE. Most style parameters within
#        KAPPA work in this way. If the user has write access to the
#        specified file, then it could be edited between invocations
#        of DISPLAY to produce different plotting styles.

#  Speed up plotting of borders, grids, etc, by reducing the Tol attribute.
      tol=0.002

#  Always draw a border around the regions of the plot containing
#  valid co-ordinates. Make it slightly wider than its default width.
      border=1
      width(border)=0.01

#  Always include textual labels describing the axes.
      textlab=1

#  Set colours for various elements of the plot.
      colour(border)=blue
      colour(grid)=green
      colour(ticks)=green
      colour(numlab)=cyan
      colour(axes)=green

#  Set colours for plot elements used by individual applications.
      colour(contour)=yellow

#  Set the size of the text to use for numerical and textual axis labels.
#  These are slightly smaller than the default sizes of 1.0.
      size(numlab)=0.8
      size(textlab)=0.9

#  Set the gaps between the axes and the associated textual labels. The default
#  is 0.01.
      textlabgap(1)=0.03
      textlabgap(2)=0.03

#  Use 2 divisions between major tick marks.
      mintick=2

#  Make the ticks marks (both major and minor) longer. The defaults are
#  0.015 for major ticks and 0.007 for minor ticks.
