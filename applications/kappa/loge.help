1 LOGE
Takes the natural logarithm of an NDF data structure.

Usage:

   loge in out

Description:

   This routine takes the natural logarithm of each pixel of a NDF
   to produce a new NDF data structure.

   This command is a synonym for "logar base=natural".
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 IN
IN = NDF (Read)
   Input NDF data structure.
3 OUT
OUT = NDF (Write)
   Output NDF data structure being the logarithm of the input NDF.
3 TITLE
TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
   Value for the title of the output NDF.  A null value will cause
   the title of the NDF supplied for parameter IN to be used
   instead. [!]
2 Examples
loge a b
   This takes the natural logarithm of the pixels in the NDF called
   a, to make the NDF called b.  NDF b inherits its title from a.

loge title="Cas A" out=b in=a
   This takes the natural logarithm of the pixels in the NDF called
   a, to make the NDF called b.  NDF b has the title "Cas A".

2 Implementation_Status
   -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
   LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, HISTORY, WCS, and VARIANCE components of an
   NDF data structure and propagates all extensions.

   -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
   supported.

   -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.
