      SUBROUTINE CONTOVER( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CONTOVER

*  Purpose:
*     Contours a 2-d NDF overlaid on an image displayed previously.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CONTOVER( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This application draws a contour plot of a 2-dimensional NDF
*     using an efficient algorithm.  The array may be part or whole of
*     the data array, but also the variance or quality can be shown.

*     The contour plot is drawn over an existing image that is
*     displayed on the chosen graphics workstation or its overlay,
*     provided the displayed image has been recorded in the graphics
*     database.  (This will be the case for other display routines in
*     KAPPA.)  The contour plotting occurs within the current picture
*     only if it is a DATA picture, otherwise contours are overlaid in
*     the last DATA picture within the current picture.  This
*     application assumes that the world co-ordinate systems of the data
*     array and the displayed image are both in pixel units, but not to
*     the same origins.  Pixel x-y offsets may be given to match the
*     contour plot with the image, provided some contouring will be
*     visible.  These displacements are in the sense image co-ordinate
*     minus the data-array co-ordinate for an arbitrary fiducial point.

*     The contouring algorithm has only pixel resolution, and
*     so the contours are not smooth, but this makes the processing
*     much faster.  There are seven methods for selecting contours.

*     The best way to use this application is to first display an image
*     on the base plane of an image display, make this the current
*     picture, and then plot contours on the overlay plane, clearing
*     the overlay picture each time. This enables more than one attempt
*     at getting the correct contour heights.  The underlying image will
*     not be erased. (Note that if you do not make the underlying image
*     the current picture, the contour plot becomes the last DATA
*     picture, and so any subsequent x-y offsets should be set to 0,0 to
*     prevent successive contour plots being incorrectly located.)

*  Usage:
*     contover ndf [comp] offset mode ncont [device] 
*        { firstcnt=? stepcnt=?
*        { heights=?
*        { percentiles=?
*        mode

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     CLEAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        True if the graphics device is to be cleared before display
*        of the array.  It should only be true for an overlay device.
*        [TRUE]
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The NDF component to be contoured.  It may be "Data",
*        "Quality", "Variance", or "Error" (where "Error" is the
*        alternative to "Variance" and causes the square root of the
*        variance values to be taken before plotting contours).  If
*        "Quality" is specified, then the quality values are treated as
*        numerical values (in the range 0 to 255). ["Data"]
*     CONCOL = LITERAL (Read)
*        The colour of the contour lines on devices that support colour.
*        The options are described below.
*
*          "MAX"          - The maximum colour index in the image 
*                           display colour lookup table.
*          "MIN"          - The minimum (non-reserved) colour index in 
*                           the image-display colour lookup table.
*          An integer     - The actual colour index.  It is constrained
*                           between 0 and the maximum colour index
*                           available on the device. 
*          A named colour - Uses the named colour from the palette, and
*                           if it is not present, the nearest colour
*                           from the palette is selected.
*
*        If the colour is to remain unaltered as the lookup table is
*        manipulated choose an integer between 0 and 15, or a named
*        colour.  This parameter will be ignored if PENROT = TRUE.
*        [The current value, but equals "1" (the foreground colour) if
*        there is no current value.] 
*     DASHED = _REAL (Read)
*        The height below which the contours will be drawn with dashed
*        lines.  A null value (!) means all contours are drawn with
*        solid lines.  This facility is only available when ANNOTA =
*        FALSE. [!]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The plotting device.  The device must be in one of the
*        following GNS categories: IMAGE_DISPLAY, IMAGE_OVERLAY,
*        WINDOW, WINDOW_OVERLAY, or MATRIX_PRINTER.
*        [Current image-display-overlay device]
*     FIRSTCNT = _REAL (Read)
*        Height of the first contour (Linear and Magnitude modes).
*     HEIGHTS() = _REAL (Read)
*        Contour levels (Free mode).  The suggested default is the
*        current value.
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*          "Area"        - The contours enclose areas of the array for
*                          which the equivalent radius increases by
*                          equal increments.  You specify the number of
*                          levels.
*          "Automatic"   - The contour levels are equally spaced between
*                          the maximum and minimum pixel values in the
*                          array.  You supply the number of contour
*                          levels.
*          "Equalised"   - You define the number of equally spaced
*                          percentiles.
*          "Free"        - You specify a series of contour values
*                          explicitly.
*          "Linear"      - You define the number of contours, the start
*                          contour level and linear step between
*                          contours.
*          "Magnitude"   - You define the number of contours, the start
*                          contour level and step between contours.  The
*                          step size is in magnitudes so the nth contour
*                          is dex(-0.4*(n-1)*step) times the start
*                          contour level.
*          "Percentiles" - You specify a series of percentiles.
*
*        The suggested default is the current value, which is initially
*        "Free".
*     NCONT = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of contours required (all modes except Free and
*        Percentiles).  It must be between 1 and 50.  If the number is
*        large, the plot may be cluttered and take longer to produce.
*        6, the initial suggested default, gives reasonable results.
*        The current value becomes the suggested default.
*     NDF = NDF (Read)
*        NDF structure containing the 2-dimensional image to be
*        contoured.
*     OFFSET( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        X-y offsets of the input data-array with respect to the
*        displayed image (i.e. x_data - x_image followed by
*        y_data - y_image for any fiducial point).   These are
*        constrained so that some part of the contour plot will be
*        overlaid on the displayed image.  The suggested default is
*        [0,0], i.e. no shift.
*     PENROT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the plotting pens are cycled through the contours to
*        aid identification of the contour heights.  It is ignored
*        when annotation is selected. [FALSE]
*     PERCENTILES() = _REAL (Read)
*        Contour levels given as percentiles.  The values must lie
*        between 0.0 and 100.0. (Percentiles mode).  The suggested
*        default is the current value.
*     STEPCNT = _REAL (Read)
*        Separation between contour levels, linear for Linear mode
*        and in magnitudes for Magnitude mode.
*     THICK = _REAL (Read)
*        The thickness of the contours in the plot, where 1.0 is the
*        normal thickness.  Currently, this is only available on a few
*        devices.  It must take a value in the range 0.5--10.0.  [1.0]

*  Examples:
*     contover myfile d [-20,7] \
*        Contours the data array in the NDF called myfile on the current
*        image-display overlay device; the overlay is displaced such
*        that pixel (i,j) in myfile corresponds to pixel (i-20,j+7) in
*        the displayed image.  All other settings are defaulted, so for
*        example the current method for determining heights is used,
*        and as much of myfile will be contoured that fits into the
*        current picture.
*     contover ndf=ngc6872 mode=au ncont=5 offset=[0,0]
*        Contours the data array in the NDF called ngc6872 on the
*        current image-display overlay device.  Five equally spaced
*        contours between the maximum and minimum data values are
*        drawn.  There is no offset between the contour plot and the
*        displayed image; this can be useful for comparing an NDF
*        before and after some processing, e.g. smoothing.
*     contover iras60(200:300,100:350) comp=d offset=[3,5] \
*        Contours the portion of the data array in the NDF called iras60
*        on the current image-display overlay using the current method
*        for height selection.  The maximum portion of the data array
*        that can be contoured goes from pixel (200,100) to (300,350).
*        The overlay is displaced such that pixel (i,j) in the data
*        array corresponds to pixel (i+3,j+5) in the displayed image.
*     contover comp=v mode=fr heights=[10,20,40,80] device=xov \
*        Contours the variance array in the current NDF on the xov
*        device.  Contours at 10, 20, 40 and 80 are drawn.  There is no
*        displacement between the variance contour plot and the
*        displayed image.
*     contover mode=eq ncont=5 dashed=15 pencol=blue ndf=skyflux
*        Contours the data array in the NDF called skyflux on the
*        current image-overlay device.  Contours at heights
*        corresponding to the 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 percentiles are
*        drawn in blue (if available).  Those contours whose values
*        less than 15 will appear as dashed lines.  There is no
*        displacement between the contour plot and the displayed image.
*     contover xx1 mode=pe percentiles=[90,95,98,99] pencol=white
*     noclear device=epsf_l
*        Contours the data array in the NDF called xx1 on the epsf_l
*        device.  White contours at heights corresponding to the 90, 95,
*        98, and 99 percentiles are drawn.  The display is not cleared.
*        There is no displacement.  The output file could be combined
*        with a DISPLAY plot (using PSMERGE) to make a hardcopy of a
*        contour plot on a dark image.

*  Notes:
*     -  The application records the contour plot as a DATA picture
*     with world co-ordinates in units of data pixels in the graphics
*     database.  The DATA picture may also may have double-precision
*     data co-ordinates derived from the NDF axis components provided
*     these are linear and different from pixel co-ordinates; the data
*     co-ordinates are stored via a linear transformation.  The NDF
*     associated with the plot is stored by reference with the DATA
*     picture.  On exit the current database picture for the chosen
*     device reverts to the input picture.
*     -  There are some options for setting the characteristics of the
*     contour lines.  By default, solid lines are drawn with the same
*     colour as the axes and key, namely the foreground colour.  The
*     colour will depend on the graphics device chosen, but it is often
*     black for printers or white for terminals.  The alternatives to
*     override this default behaviour are listed below.
*
*        1. Set a colour for all contours using parameter CONCOL.
*           The choices may be quite restrictive on certain devices,
*           for example a window overlay only has one colour.  Use
*           the PALENTRY command to change this colour.
*        2. Request dashed contours below some threshold given by
*           parameter DASHED and solid lines for other heights.  All
*           contours have either the foreground colour or that
*           prescribed by parameter CONCOL.
*        3. Cycle the pens modulo 3 for each contour height actually
*           plotted by setting PENROT = TRUE.  The characteristics of
*           the second and third line styles will depend on the chosen
*           graphics device.  An image display or pen plotter will draw
*           coloured lines using palette entries 1 to 3; whereas a
*           window overlay, monochrome laser printer or terminal will
*           draw a variety of dashed or thicker lines.
*        4. Combine options 2 and 3.  However, palette colours 1 to 3
*           will always be used and CONCOL ignored.  The contours below
*           the threshold continue the cycle through the three colours.
*           There may be some confusion on devices that already use
*           dashed lines, so this is only suitable for devices
*           supporting at least three colours simultaneously.
*
*     Pen rotation takes precedence over colour control through CONCOL. 

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Find which component to display, obtain an identifier to the
*     NDF and check that the component is present. Find the data type
*     for processing.  Get the NDF bounds and inquire the bad-pixel
*     flag.
*     -  Get the display device and open the database for it with the
*     appropriate device status. Get the current SGS zone.  Check that
*     the device is an image-display.  Obtain the the last DATA picture
*     and report its name, comment and label.
*     -  Obtain the zone's pixel sizes, and obtain the offsets using
*     the pixel sizes as constraints.  Find the region of the displayed
*     image that will have contours overlaid, and make it a new zone.
*     Create and map the section to be contoured.  Redefine the
*     zone's co-ordinates to those of the NDF sections' size.
*     -  Select the contour heights and sort them in ascending order.
*     -  Get the contour-style parameter.
*     -  Obtain the data co-ordinate transformation and axis bounds.
*     -  Obtain lots of work arrays, redefine the co-ordinates to that
*     of the array and plot the contours.  Clear workspace.  Store the
*     contour picture in the database, plus the data reference, and the
*     transformation for data co-ordinates.
*     -  Report the heights drawn.
*     -  Tidy graphics and NDF.

*     KAPPA: CONTOUR, TURBOCONT; Figaro: ICONT; SPECDRE: SPECCONT.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  Only real data can be processed directly.  Other data types
*     will undergo a type conversion before the contour plot is drawn.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Lots of missing options to tailor the plot.  The co-ordinate
*     system of the underlying image and the overlay contour plot is
*     limited to pixels and you have to compute it yourself.  The
*     overlay will appear over any obscured portion of the image.
