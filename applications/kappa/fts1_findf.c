 *  Routine:
 *     FTS1_FINDF
 *
 *  Function:
 *     Returns successive file names that match a file specification.
 *
 *  Description:
 *     This routine is intended to provide some of the facilities provided
 *     on a VAX by the standard VMS routine LIB$FIND_FILE.  It is passed
 *     a file specification that can contain wild card characters such as
 *     '*', e.g. '*.*'.  On the first call the Context variable should be set
 *     to zero, and the routine will return the name of the first file that
 *     matches the file specification.  On subsequent calls the calling 
 *     routine should continue to call using the value of Context returned
 *     by the previous call, and each call will return the name of the next
 *     file that matches the specification.  When the last file that matches
 *     the specification has been returned, subsequent calls will return
 *     a blank string as the file name and an error code (an even value)
 *     as the function value.  Finally, a call to FTS1_FINDE with the
 *     last returned value of Context will close down any files opened or
 *     memory allocated by FTS1_FINDF.
 *
 *  Language:
 *     C, designed to be called from Fortran.
 *
 *  Call:
 *     (from Fortran)
 *     STATUS = FTS1_FINDF ( FILESPEC, FILENAME, CONTEXT )
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *     (>) FILESPEC   (Character string) The file specification to be
 *                    matched.  May contain wildcards.  Case sensitive.
 *     (<) FILENAME   (Character string) The name of a file that matches 
 *                    FILESPEC.
 *     (!) CONTEXT    (Integer, ref) A variable used to remember the context of
 *                    a series of calls for the same file specification.
 *                    Should be set to zero by the caller for the first call
 *                    for a new specification and the value then returned 
 *                    by this routine should be used in subsequent calls.
 *  Returns:
 *     (<) STATUS     (Integer, function value) A status code.  These have
 *                    been chosen to match with VMS conventions, with an odd
 *                    value (actually 1) indicating success and an even value
 *                    indicating a failure.
 *
 *  Bugs and limitations:
 *      This routine does not provide all the facilities offered by the
 *      original VAX version; it only accepts the first three arguments as
 *      listed above, and almost of necessity it uses and expects UNIX syntax
 *      for the file specs.  This means that '/usr/users/ks/*.*' is OK, but
 *      '[ks]*.*' is not. Note that '*' and '*.*' will give quite different
 *      results under UNIX, whereas under VMS they would be the same. There
 *      is no way of specifying recursion; '/usr/user/ks/...' for example
 *      is meaningless. Nevertheless, it is hoped that it is close enough in 
 *      functionality to the VMS original to act as a useable substitute in 
 *      most cases. It cannot handle specifications that the standard shell
 *      (sh) cannot handle in an 'ls' command - there are some variations of
 *      the 'ls' command involving complex wildcarding that will cause sh
 *      on a SUN to hang, and they will also hang this routine.
 *
 *      It is not at all clear that the method used here is  in any way
 *      the best solution to the problem, and there are a number of possible
 *      alternatives that could be tried, including using 'find' rather than
 *      'ls', or using routines such as readdir() to search the file system
 *      and do any pattern matching in this routine itself. The program as it
 *      stands should be regarded (tolerantly!) as an initial attempt and
 *      the author would be glad to be sent a better version.
 *
 *  Method:
 *      The routine works by forking off a process that runs an 'ls Filespec'
 *      command and reads the output from that process through a pipe. Each
 *      line read will normally contain a file name and that is returned.
 *      The main complication comes from file specifications such as '*'
 *      for which 'ls' will list both normal files and the contents of all
 *      directories, including in its output both blank lines and the names
 *      of the directories.  The routine traps such directory names and
 *      remembers them and prefixes them to the subsequent filenames.
 *      Context is used as the address of a structure containing things that
 *      need to be remembered across calls, such as file descriptors and
 *      the last directory specification.

 *
 *  History:
 *      5th Feb 1992 (KS):
 *         Original version.
 *      28-FEB-1991 (PDRAPER):
 *         Changed name to find_file from lib$find_file.  Problems with
 *         gcc compiler and $ in name.  Increased command length to 256.
 *         Fixed bug comparing Nchars and SpecLength.  Added Wait for forked
 *         process.  Removed extra argument to strncat function (incorrect
 *         length used as consequence).
 *      8-SEP-1992 (DSB):
 *         Decreased by one the max number of characters copied from the 
 *         file spec in order to leave room for the null character.  Also
 *         the null character which terminates the "ls" command is now put
 *         at the end of the characters copied from the file spec, rather
 *         than at the end of the variable "command".
 *      1993 January 6 (MJC):
 *         Renamed to FTS1_FINDF for KAPPA FITS.  This is as a temporary
 *         measure until a Starlink standard, and improved equivalent of
 *         this routine is available.
 *      FEB 1993 (DLT):
 *         Void ** to int * as Alpha returns addresses as 64 bits (casting
 *         to int * avoids this as compiler options are 32 bit.  Fixed \0 
 *         appending to wrong part of string.
 *      16-MAR-1993 (PDRAPER):
 *         Changed to use Starlink CNF macros for enhanced portabilility.
 *      7-JUL-1993 (PDRAPER):
 *         Stopped modification of FileSpec point by ++ operator.  Now uses
 *         local copy.
 *      11-NOV-1993 (PDRAPER):
 *         New version of cnf casts input pointer as unsigned int (in line
 *         with alpha port).  This breaks under cast from pointer to structure
 *         (ContextPtr) on ultrix.  Added cast to F77_POINTER_TYPE to fix this.
 *      15-MAR-1995 (PDRAPER):
 *         Run through lint on OSF/1, loads of include files added.
 *      15-AUG-1995 (PDRAPER):
 *         Changed system call to execl and exit to _exit.  These
 *         changes are necessary to stop exit handlers being invoked
 *         on exit of child process when being run from ICL/TCL using
 *         the AMS/MSP systems.

 *      28-Feb-1992 (PRAPER):
 *         Changed name to FIND_FILE_END removing LIB$
 *      1993 January 6 (MJC):
 *         Renamed to FTS1_FINDF for KAPPA FITS.  This is as a temporary
 *         measure until a Starlink standard equivalent of this routine
 *         is available.
 *      16-Mar-1993 (PDRAPER):
 *         Changed to use Starlink CNF interface.
