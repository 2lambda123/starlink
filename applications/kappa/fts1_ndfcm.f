      SUBROUTINE FTS1_NDFCM( NCARD, HEADER, SCARD, NDF, NENCOD, ENCODS,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_NDFCM

*  Purpose:
*     Create the title, units, axes, wcs, and FITS extension in an NDF
*     from the FITS headers.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_NDFCM( NCARD, HEADER, SCARD, NDF, NENCOD, ENCODS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine adds the character components, axis structure, WCS
*     component and FITS extension to an NDF.  It searches a buffer 
*     containing the FITS header card images for the OBJECT keyword whose 
*     value becomes the NDF title if present.  Similarly BUNIT is mapped to
*     the NDF units.  The supplied header structure is copied to the
*     FITS extension.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of cards in the array of headers, from the start of
*        the first header section to the end of the current one.
*     HEADER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * 80 (Given)
*        The buffer containing the header card images.
*     SCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from where searches will begin, and 
*        copying of the headers to the FITS extension.   Therefore
*        NCARD - SCARD + 1 headers will appear in the extension. This
*        argument is needed because the headers make contain a dummy
*        header prior to an extension.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier of the NDF to which to write the additional 
*        components and the FITS extension.
*     NENCOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of AST encodings supplied in ENCODS.
*     ENCODS( NENCOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The user's preferred AST encodings. If NENCOD is zero, then this
*        is ignored, and an intelligent guess is made as to which encoding
*        to use. The encoding determines which FITS headers are used to
*        create the NDF WCS component.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.
