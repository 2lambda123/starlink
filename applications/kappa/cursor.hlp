.help cursor Starlink kappa
.nf
Reports the co-ordinates of positions selected using the cursor.

Usage:

   cursor [mode] [name] [outcat] [device]

Description:

   This application reads co-ordinates from the chosen graphics device
   using a cursor and displays them on your terminal. The selected
   positions may be marked in various ways on the device (see parameter
   PLOT), and can be written to an output positions list so that subsequent
   applications can make use of them (see parameter OUTCAT). The format
   of the displayed positions may be controlled using parameter STYLE.

   Positions may be reported in several different co-ordinate Frames
   (see parameter FRAME).

   The picture or pictures within which positions are required can be
   selected in several ways (see parameters MODE and NAME).

   Restrictions can be made on the number of positions to be given (see
   parameters MAXPOS and MINPOS), and screen output can be suppressed
   (see parameter QUIET).

Parameters

For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:

CLOSE

CLOSE = LOGICAL (Read)
   This parameter is only accessed if parameter PLOT is set to
   "Chain" or "Poly". If TRUE, polgons will be closed by joining
   the first position to the last position. [Current value]

DESCRIBE

DESCRIBE = LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE, a detailed description of the co-ordinate Frame in which
   subsequent positions will be reported is produced each time a
   position is reported within a new picture. [Current value]

DEVICE

DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
   The graphics workstation.  This device must support cursor
   interaction. [The current graphics device]

EPOCH

EPOCH = DOUBLE PRECISION (Read)
   If an IRAS90 Sky Co-ordinate System specification is supplied
   (using parameter FRAME) for a celestial co-ordinate system,
   then an epoch value is needed to qualify it. This is the epoch at
   which the supplied sky positions were determined. It should be
   given as a decimal years value, with or without decimal places
   ("1996.8" for example). Such values are interpreted as a Besselian
   epoch if less than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch otherwise.

FRAME

FRAME = LITERAL (Read)
   A string determining the co-ordinate Frame in which positions are
   to be reported. When a data array is displayed by an application
   such as DISPLAY, CONTOUR, etc, WCS information describing the co-ordinate
   systems known to the data array are stored with the DATA picture
   in the graphics database. This application can report positions in
   any of the co-ordinate Frames stored with each picture. The
   string supplied for FRAME can be one of the following:

   - A Domain name such as SKY, AXIS, PIXEL, etc. The special Domains
   AGI_WORLD and AGI_DATA are used to refer to the world and data
   co-ordinate system stored in the AGI graphics database. They can
   be useful if no WCS information was store with the picture when
   it was created.

   - An integer value giving the index of the required Frame.

   - An IRAS90 Sky Co-ordinate System (SCS) values such as
   EQUAT(J2000) (see SUN/163).

   If a null value (!) is supplied, positions are reported in the
   co-ordinate Frame which was current when the picture was created.
   [!]

GEODESIC

GEODESIC = LOGICAL (Read)
   This parameter is only accessed if parameter PLOT is set to
   "Chain" or "Poly". It specifies whether the curves drawn between
   positions should be stright lines, or should be geodesic curves.
   In many co-ordinate Frames geodesic curves will be simple straight
   lines. However, in others (such as the majority of celestial
   co-ordinates Frames) geodesic curves will be more complex curves
   tracing the shortest path between two positions in a non-linear
   projection. [FALSE]

INFO

INFO = LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE then messages are displayed describing the use of the
   mouse prior to obtaining the first position. Note, these
   informational messages are not suppressed by setting parameter
   QUIET to TRUE. [TRUE]

LASTDIM

LASTDIM = _INTEGER (Write)
   The number of axis values written to parameter LASTPOS.

LASTPOS

LASTPOS() = _DOUBLE (Write)
   The unformatted co-ordinates of the last valid position selected
   with the cursor, in the co-ordinate Frame which was used to
   report the position. The number of axis values is written to output
   parameter LASTDIM.

LOGFILE

LOGFILE = FILENAME (Write)
   The name of the text file in which the formatted co-ordinates of
   positions selected with the cursor may be stored. This is intended
   primarily for recording the screen output, and not for communicating
   positions to subsequent applications (use parameter OUTCAT for this
   purpose). A null string (!) means that no file is created.  [!]

MARKER

MARKER = INTEGER (Read)
   This parameter is only accessed if parameter PLOT is set to
   "Chain" or "Mark". It specifies the symbol with which each
   position should be marked, and should be given as an integer
   PGPLOT marker type. For instance, 0 gives a box, 1 gives a dot,
   2 gives a cross, 3 gives an asterisk, 7 gives a triangle. The
   value must be larger than or equal to -31. [current value]

MAXPOS

MAXPOS = INTEGER (Read)
   The maximum number of positions which may be supplied before the
   application terminates. The number must be in the range 1 to 500.
   [500]

MINPOS

MINPOS = INTEGER (Read)
   The minimum number of positions which may be supplied. The user
   is asked to supply more if necessary. The number must be in the
   range 0 to the value of parameter MAXPOS. [0]

MODE

MODE = LITERAL (Read)
   The method used to select the pictures in which cursor positions are
   to be reported. There are three options:

   - "Current" -- reports positions within the current picture in the
   AGI database. If a position does not lie within the current picture,
   an extrapolated position is reported, if possible.

   - "Dynamic" -- reports positions within the top-most picture
   under the cursor in the AGI  database.  Thus the second and
   subsequent cursor hits may result in the selection of a new picture.

   - "Anchor" -- lets the first cursor hit select the picture in
   which all positions are to be reported. If a subsequent cursor hit
   falls outside this picture, an extrapolated position is reported if
   possible.

   ["Dynamic"]

NAME

NAME = LITERAL (Read)
   Only pictures of this name are to be selected.  For instance, if
   you want positions in a DATA picture which is covered by a
   transparent FRAME picture, then you could specify NAME=DATA.
   A null (!) or blank string means that pictures of all names may
   be selected. NAME is ignored when MODE = "Current". [!]

NUMBER

NUMBER = _INTEGER (Write)
   The number of positions selected with the cursor (excluding
   invalid positions).

OUTCAT

OUTCAT = FILENAME (Write)
   An output catalogue in which to store the valid selected positions.
   The catalogue has the form of a positions list such as created by
   application LISTMAKE. Only positions in the first selected picture
   are recorded. This application uses the conventions of the CURSA
   package (SUN/190) for determining the format of the catalogue. If a
   file type of .fits is given, then the catalogue is stored as a FITS
   binary table. If a file type of .txt is given, then the catalogue
   is stored in a text file in "Small Text List" (STL) format. If no
   file type is given, then ".fit" is assumed. If a null value is
   supplied, no output positions list is produced. [!]

PLOT

PLOT = LITERAL (Read)
   The type of graphics to be used to mark the selected positions
   which have valid co-ordinates.  The appearance of these graphics
   (colour, size, etc ) is controlled by the STYLE parameter. PLOT
   can take any of the following values:

   - "None" -- No graphics are produced.

   - "Mark" -- Each position is marked by the symbol specified
   by parameter MARKER.

   - "Poly" -- Causes each position to be joined by a line to the
   previous position.  These lines may be simple straight lines or
   geodesic curves (see parameter GEODESIC). The polygons may
   optionally be closed by joining the last position to the first (see
   parameter CLOSE).

   - "Chain" -- This is a combination of "Mark" and "Poly". Each
   position is marked by a symbol and joined by a line to the previous
   position. Parameters MARKER, GEODESIC and CLOSE are used to
   specify the symbols and lines to use.

   [Current value]

QUIET

QUIET = LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE then positions are not reported on the screen. Output
   parameters and files are still created. The display of informational
   messages describing the use of the cursor is controlled by the
   parameter INFO. [FALSE]

STYLE

STYLE = LITERAL (Read)
   The name of a text file containing a description of the plotting
   style to use when drawing the graphics specified by parameter PLOT.
   By specifying suitable values for Frame attributes (eg Digits(1),
   Digits(2), Symbol(1), Symbol(2), etc), it can also be used to
   control the format for the displayed axis values.

   Each line in the file should contain a string of the form
   <name>=<value>, in which <name> is the name of an attribute,
   and <value> is the value to assign to the attribute. The file may
   contain blank lines and comment lines starting with a hash (#) sign.
   Default values will be used for any unspecified attributes. All
   attributes will be defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied,
   or if the specified file cannot be accessed. [Current value]

Examples

cursor frame=pixel
   This obtains co-ordinates within any visible picture for the
   current graphics device by use of the cursor. Positions are
   reported in pixel co-ordinates if available, and in the current
   co-ordinate Frame of the picture otherwise.

cursor frame=equat(J2010)
   This obtains co-ordinates within any visible picture for the
   current graphics device by use of the cursor. Positions are
   reported in equatorial RA/DEC co-ordinates (referenced to the
   J2010 equinox) if available, and in the current co-ordinate Frame
   of the picture otherwise.

cursor describe plot=mark marker=3 style="colour=red,size=2"
   As above except, positions are always reported in the current
   co-ordinate Frame of each picture. The details of these co-ordinate
   Frames are described as they are used. Each selected point is
   marked with PGPLOT marker 3 (an asterisk). The markers are
   red and are twice the default size.

cursor current maxpos=2 minpos=2 plot=poly quiet outcat=slice
   Exactly two positions are obtained within the current picture,
   and are joined with a straight line. The positions are written to
   a FITS binary catalogue called slice.fit but are not displayed on
   the screen. The catalogue may be used to communicate the positions
   to later applications (LISTSHOW, PROFILE, etc).

cursor name=data style="^mystyle,digits(1)=5,digits(2)=7"
   This obtains co-ordinates within any visible DATA picture on
   the current graphics device.  The style to use is read from
   text file mystyle, but is then modified so that 5 digits are used
   to format axis 1 values, and 7 to format axis 2 values.

Notes

-  The unformatted values stored in the output parameter LASTPOS,
may not be in the same units as the formatted values shown on
the screen and logged to the log file. For instance, unformatted
celestial co-ordinate values are stored in radians.

-  The current picture is unchanged by this application.

-  In DYNAMIC and ANCHOR modes, if the cursor is situated at a
position where there are no pictures of the selected name, the
co-ordinates in the BASE picture are reported.

-  Positions can be removed (the instructions state how), starting
from the most-recent one.  Such positions are excluded from the
output positions list and log file (if applicable). If graphics
are being used to mark the positions, then removed positions will
be highlighted by drawing a marker of type 8 (a circle containing a
cross) over the removed positions in a different colour.
