#  Read lines of text from standard input.
   while( $line = <STDIN> ) {

#  If the current line begines with a digit 1 followed by a space, then
#  we are starting a new entry. Extract the title of the entry from the
#  line (the text following the initial "1 " string).
      if( $line =~ /^1 (\s*.*)\s$/ ){
         $key = $1;
      } 

#  Use the title as the key into a hash, appending the whole line of text
#  to any current entry for the key.
      if( $key ) {
         $map{$key} .= $line;

#  Print any stuff that comes before the first "1 " line immediately.
      } else {
         print $line;
      }
   }

#  Once all text has been read from standard input, sort the hash keys 
#  into alphabetical order, and the write the has entries out to standard
#  output.
   foreach $key (sort keys %map){
      print $map{$key},"\n";
