      SUBROUTINE FTS1_WCSIM( FC, INDF, NENCOD, ENCODS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_WCSIM

*  Purpose:
*     Imports WCS information from the supplied FitsChan into the supplied
*     NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_WCSIM( FC, INDF, NENCOD, ENCODS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An attempt is made to read an AST FrameSet (see SUN/210) from the 
*     supplied FitsChan. If succesful, it is added into the FrameSet 
*     representing the NDF's WCS component. This is done by connecting
*     the base Frames of the two FrameSets with a UnitMap (on the
*     assumption that they are equivalent). The modified FrameSet is
*     then stored back in the NDF (the NDF library will automatically
*     remove any PIXEL, GRID and AXIS Frames from the FrameSet as these
*     are generated afresh each time NDF_GTWCS is called).
*    
*     The supplied FitsChan may contain more than one description (or
*     "encoding") of the FrameSet to be added to the NDF, each 
*     encoding using a different set of header cards. These encodings
*     may not all be consistent with each other. For instance, if a
*     Starlink application stores a FrameSet twice in a FITS header using 
*     FITS-WCS and AST native encodings, an IRAF application may then 
*     modify the FITS-WCS encoding without making equivalent modifications 
*     to the native encoding. In this case, we should use the FITS-WCS 
*     encoding in preference to the native encoding when reconstructing 
*     the NDFs WCS component. On the other hand, if the two encodings were 
*     still consistent, it would be preferable to use the native encoding 
*     since the FITS-WCS encoding may not give a complete description of the 
*     original FrameSet.
*
*     The choice of encoding has several stages:
*
*     o  If the caller has supplied a list of preferred encodings in the
*     ENCODS argument, then the first available encoding in this list is
*     used.
*     o  If no preferred encodings are supplied, then a check is made to 
*     see if a native encoding is available. If there is no native encoding, 
*     then the default encoding supplied by AST is used. This will be a 
*     non-native encoding selected on the basis of the header cards available 
*     in the FitsChan.
*     o  If a native encoding is available, and is the only available
*     encoding, then it is used.
*     o  If both native and non-native encodings are available, then the
*     first non-native encoding to be found which is inconsistent with the
*     native encoding is used. If all encodings are consistent, then the
*     native encoding is used. The first inconsistent encoding is used on
*     the assumption that software which modifies the native encoding
*     (i.e. mainly Starlink software) will also modify the non-native
*     encodings so that they remain consistent. Foreign software however
*     (i.e. non-AST software) will probably not bother to modify the native
*     encoding when the non-native encoding is modified.

*  Arguments:
*     FC = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to the FitsChan in which to store the NDF's WCS
*        information.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     NENCOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of encodings supplied in ENCODS.
*     ENCODS( NENCOD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The preferred encodings to use, in order of preference (most 
*        preferable first). Ignored if NENCOD is zero.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
