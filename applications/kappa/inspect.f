      SUBROUTINE INSPECT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     INSPECT

*  Purpose:
*     Inspects a 2-d NDF in a variety of ways.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL INSPECT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application provides an interactive facility to inspect the
*     details of whole or part of the 2-dimensional data array in an
*     input NDF.  Briefly, the inspection options permit: a region to
*     be selected for which statistics may be calculated, its values
*     written to a text file, or an histogram be plotted and saved in
*     an NDF; the region itself may be saved in an NDF; the value of a
*     pixel or a region of pixels to be viewed; a slice between two
*     pixels may be calculated, plotted and saved in an NDF; text
*     files containing x-y-value of selected pixels may be created and
*     extended, and chosen pixels marked.
*
*     The application has two modes of interaction: cursor and
*     interface.  In cursor mode the selection of pixels, and the
*     definition of the region are made by moving a graphics cursor
*     over a previously displayed image or contour plot.  Since
*     instructional text showing the function of the mouse or
*     trackerball buttons is shown, the graphics device providing the
*     cursor must be an image-display overlay.  Also the name of the
*     NDF used to display the image or contour plot is known and need
*     not be entered.  This is the recommended interaction mode.  The
*     alternative, interface, means that the pixel indices of pixels
*     and regions to be inspected are specified in response to prompts.

*     The application is composed of two parts.  First the preliminaries
*     obtains the mode, the input NDF and graphics devices.  In cursor
*     mode this usually amounts to a single prompt, and but two in
*     interface mode.  The second stage is a loop where the inspection
*     option is selected and performed.

*  Usage:
*     inspect in [mode] gdevice option [overlay]
*        { numbin=? hirep=? histogram=? hititle=?
*        { filename=?
*        { peind=?
*        { lbound=? ubound=?
*        { out=?
*        { slstart=? slend=? slice=? sltitle=?
*        { vaind=?
*        { xycont=? xyfile=? xytitle=?
*        option
*  
*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ABSLAB  =  LITERAL (Read)
*        Label for the line-plot abscissa, in which NCAR fancy founts
*        may be embedded when FONT = "NCAR".  Note Slice and Histogram
*        have different defaults and these are stored separately.
*
*        For a slice plot the suggested default is the current value,
*        which is initially "Pixels".  If an error occurs obtaining the
*        label the default is "Pixels".
*
*        If axis information is present the suggested default for a
*        plot of an histogram is the NDF's axis label followed by the
*        units, in parentheses.  If an error occurs obtaining the label
*        or there is no axis information, the label takes its current
*        value, which initially is "Values".
*
*        For the first plot ABSLAB is defaulted to the suggested value
*        unless PLOTSTYLE is included on the command line, and
*        subsequently will only be obtained whenever PLOTSTYLE is TRUE.
*        []
*     FILENAME = FILENAME (Write)
*        Name of the text file to contain the Listing of image values.
*        The suggested default is inspect_list.lis.  This is only
*        required for the "List" option.
*     FONT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The fount to be used for the line graphics.  It can be either
*        "NCAR" for the NCAR fancy characters and "GKS" for the standard
*        GKS san-serif fount.   The former is intended for hardcopy
*        publication-quality plots, since it is relatively slow; the
*        latter is intended for normal interactive graphics requiring
*        rapid plotting, and it is clearer on small plots. The
*        suggested default is the current value. ["GKS"]
*
*        For the first plot FONT is defaulted to "GKS", and
*        subsequently will only be obtained whenever PLOTSTYLE is TRUE.
*        []
*     GDEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The name of the graphics device for line plots produced by the
*        "Histogram" and "Slice" options.  The device should not be the
*        image display, but it may be the image-display overlay plane
*        used in the cursor-interaction mode, i.e. the same value as
*        parameter OVERLAY (though this is not advisable for
*        X-windows).  In the latter case plotting occurs in the same
*        picture as the overlay annotations, namely the current
*        picture.  If the existing plot on the base plane of the image
*        display has text, e.g. annotated axes, a mess can of confused
*        lines can appear.  To avoid this the current picture should be
*        made the DATA picture rather than the FRAME around it.  If
*        null, !, is given no line plots will be drawn unless the
*        "Device" option is selected.
*     HIREP = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the full Histogram is to be reported to you.  A large
*        number of bins may be required for the plot but need not be
*        listed in full.  This parameter provides a way of preventing
*        unwanted, tedious and long output.  The suggested default is
*        FALSE.  HIREP is only required for the "Histogram" option.
*     HISTOGRAM = NDF (Read)
*        Name of the NDF structure to save the Histogram in its data
*        array.  If null, !, is entered, the histogram NDF is not
*        created.  This parameter is only required for the "Histogram"
*        option.  The suggested default is !.
*     HITITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output NDF containing the Histogram.  For the
*        first histogram saved this defaults to
*        "KAPPA - Inspect_Histogram", and subsequently this becomes
*        the suggested default.   This parameter is only required for
*        the "Histogram" option. []
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        NDF structure containing the 2-dimensional data array to be
*        inspected.
*     LBOUND( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Lower bounds in pixel indices of the Region.  The chosen pixel
*        must be different from that at the lower bound.  It is only
*        used in Interface mode with the "Region" option.
*     MAJTIC( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The parameter controlling the numbers of major tick marks
*        for the x and y axes in the slice or histogram plot.
*        (The number used is between MAJTIC+2 and 5*MAJTIC/2+4.).
*
*        By default, it is [4.,4.].  For the first plot MAJTIC is
*        defaulted, and subsequently will only be obtained whenever
*        PLOTSTYLE is TRUE.  []
*     MINTIC( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The number of minor tick marks between each major tick mark
*        for linear x and y axes in the slice or histogram plot.  A
*        negative value forces the graphics package to compute
*        appropriate values.  The number of minor tick marks per major
*        tick is fixed (8) for a logarithmic axis.
*        
*        By default, it is [-1.,-1.].  For the first plot MINTIC is
*        defaulted, and subsequently will only be obtained whenever
*        PLOTSTYLE is TRUE.  []
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The interaction mode.  The options are "Cursor" to use a
*        graphics cursor to select regions and pixels to inspect,
*        or "Interface" where prompted ADAM parameters are used to
*        define those parts of the image to inspect. [Current
*        interaction mode]
*     NUMBIN = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Number of bins needed for the Histogram.  The suggested default
*        is the current value, which is 100 initially.  A value is the
*        range 2--5000 is required.  This parameter is only required
*        for the "Histogram" option.
*     OPTION = LITERAL (Read)
*        Current inspection mode.  The options are:
*
*         "Device"     - This allows the selection and opening of a new
*                        line-plot graphics device, at the same time
*                        closing down the old one, whose last plot is
*                        stored in the graphics database.
*         "Exit"       - Exit the application.
*         "Histogram"  - This calculates the histogram of the current
*                        region. A summary and plot (if there is a
*                        graphics device available) of the histogram
*                        is produced.  The style of the plot may be
*                        adjusted via several parameters.  The full
*                        histogram may also be reported. The histogram
*                        data can be stored in a 1-d NDF.
*         "List"       - This produces a formatted and headed listing
*                        of the chosen region to a text file.
*         "Peep"       - Obtain a formatted listing of the 7x7 section
*                        of the array data, centred on a pixel
*                        specified using the cursor or via prompting.
*         "Region"     - To define the region of the array to be used
*                        by other options. If the image display
*                        is available, then the cursor is used to
*                        define the area, otherwise, the pixel bounds
*                        of the region come from the environment. Using
*                        the cursor, the functions of the choice-device
*                        buttons are drawn on the overlay.
*         "Save"       - Writes the current region to a new NDF,
*                        propagating all the components.
*         "Slice"      - Two points are defined via the cursor or from
*                        parameter prompting between which a slice (i.e.
*                        cross-section) is calculated.  Using the
*                        cursor, the functions of the trackerball or
*                        mouse buttons are drawn on the overlay. A plot
*                        is made to the graphics device if available.
*                        The style of the plot may be adjusted via
*                        several parameters.  The slice can be stored
*                        in a 1-d NDF.  The slice abscissa has units in
*                        true pixels (assuming pixels are square), thus
*                        a 45-degree slice would have a length root 2
*                        times its projected length in x or y.
*         "Statistics" - The key statistical parameters of the current
*                        region are determined and reported.
*         "Value"      - Obtain the value of a pixel at a point selected
*                        via the cursor or via prompting.
*         "XYcur"      - A list of the co-ordinates and values of pixels
*                        selected by the image-display cursor are
*                        written to a text file with Fortran carriage
*                        control. The functions of the trackerball or
*                        mouse buttons are displayed.  Optionally, an
*                        existing file in the same format as produced
*                        by XYcur can be appended to, for example, when
*                        a session has been interrupted.  These stored
*                        pixels are displayed on the overlay plane as
*                        if there had been no interruption.  XYcur
*                        requires cursor mode.
*
*        The suggested default is "Region".
*
*        If the option is specified on the command line a single
*        inspection may be undertaken, i.e.  there is no looping.  This
*        feature is intended for command procedures.
*     ORDLAB  =  LITERAL (Read)
*        Label for the line-plot ordinate, in which NCAR fancy founts
*        may be embedded.  Note Slice and Histogram have different
*        defaults and these are stored separately.
*
*        For an histogram plot the suggested default is the current
*        value, which is initially "Number".  If an error occurs
*        obtaining the label the default is "Number".
*
*        If axis information is present the suggested default for a
*        plot of a slice is the NDF's axis label followed by the
*        units, in parentheses.  If an error occurs obtaining the label
*        or there is no axis information, the label takes its current
*        value, which initially is "Data values".
*
*        For the first plot ORDLAB is defaulted to the suggested value
*        unless PLOTSTYLE is included on the command line, and
*        subsequently will only be obtained whenever PLOTSTYLE is TRUE.
*        []
*     OUT = NDF (Read)
*        Name of the NDF structure to contain the Saved Region.  This
*        is only used in the "Save" option.
*     OUTTIC = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the axis tick marks are to appear on the outside of
*        the axes instead of inside in the slice or histogram plots.
*        This eliminates intersections of ticks with the data locus.
*
*        By default, the tick marks are drawn inside the plot region.
*        For the first plot OUTTIC is defaulted, and subsequently will
*        only be obtained whenever PLOTSTYLE is TRUE.  []
*     OVERLAY = DEVICE (Read)
*        Name of the overlay-plane device used in the cursor interaction
*        mode.  It must have class IMAGE_OVERLAY or WINDOW_OVERLAY and
*        support colour.  It is ignored when MODE is not "Cursor".
*        [Current image-display-overlay device]
*     PEIND( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        x-y pixel index of the pixel about which the Peep is required.
*        The values must lie within their respective bounds of the
*        input image.  The suggested default is the image centre.  It
*        is only used in Interface mode with the "Peep" option.
*     PLOTSTYLE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the plotting style of line plots is to be altered from
*        the default for the first plot, or the existing values for
*        subsequent graphs.  Initially, it is defaulted to FALSE, then
*        the suggested value is the current value.  Therefore to
*        override the plotting-style parameters on the first plot, new
*        values should be given on the command line, and along with the
*        PLOTSTYLE keyword for ABSLAB, ORDLAB and PLTITL.
*        Subsequently, the plotting style may be retained or modified
*        via prompts.  []
*     PLTITL = LITERAL (Read)
*        The title of a line plot, in which NCAR fancy founts may be
*        embedded.  Note Slice and Histogram have different defaults
*        and these are stored separately.  Both attempt to use the NDF's
*        title if present and no error occurs, otherwise the current
*        value becomes the suggested default.  For the histogram plot
*        this is initially "Histogram of current region" and for the
*        slice plot it is initially "Slice plot".
*
*        For the first plot PLTITL is defaulted to the suggested value
*        unless PLOTSTYLE is included on the command line, and
*        subsequently will only be obtained whenever PLOTSTYLE is TRUE.
*        []
*     SLEND( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The x-y pixel index defining the end of the Slice.  It
*        must lie within the bounds of the array and be distinct from
*        the start of the slice.  The suggested default is the upper
*        bound of the input NDF.  It is only used in Interface mode
*        with the "Slice" option.
*     SLICE = NDF (Read)
*        Name of the NDF structure to save the Slice in its data array.
*        If null, !, is entered, the slice NDF is not created.  It is
*        only required in the "Slice" option.  The suggested default is
*        !.
*     SLSTART( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The x-y pixel index defining the start of the Slice.  It must
*        lie within the bounds of the array.  The suggested default is
*        the lower bound of the input NDF.  It is only used in
*        Interface mode with the "Slice" option.
*     SLTITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the Slice NDF.  Title for the Region NDF.  For the
*        first region saved this defaults to "KAPPA - Inspect_Slice",
*        and subsequently this becomes the suggested default.  It is
*        only required in the "Slice" option. []
*     THICK = _REAL (Read)
*        The thickness of the axes and annotations in the histogram and
*        line plots, where 1.0 is the normal thickness.  Currently,
*        this is only available on a few devices.  It must take a value
*        in the range 0.5--5.0.
*
*        By default the line thickness is 1.0.  For the first plot
*        THICK is defaulted to the suggested value, and subsequently
*        will only be obtained whenever PLOTSTYLE is TRUE.  []
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the Region NDF.  For the first region saved this
*        defaults to "KAPPA - Inspect", and subsequently this becomes
*        the suggested default.  It is only used in the "Save" option.
*        []
*     UBOUND( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Upper bounds in pixel indices of the Region.  The chosen pixel
*        must be different from that at the lower bound.  It is only
*        used in Interface mode with the "Region" option.
*     VAIND( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        x-y pixel index of pixel whose Value is required.  The values
*        must lie within their respective bounds of the input image.
*        The suggested default is the image centre.  It is only used in
*        Interface mode with the "Value" option.
*     XLOG = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the line-plot abscissa is to be logarithmic.  Note, for
*        Slice and Histogram options each has its own independent
*        switch.  It is unlikely that you would want to do this.  By
*        default, the abscissa is linear.  For the first plot XLOG is
*        defaulted, and subsequently will only be obtained whenever
*        PLOTSTYLE is TRUE.  []
*     YLOG = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the line-plot ordinate is to be logarithmic. Note, for
*        Slice and Histogram options each has its own independent
*        switch.  By default, the ordinate is linear.  For the first
*        plot YLOG is defaulted, and subsequently will only be obtained
*        whenever PLOTSTYLE is TRUE.  []
*     XYCONT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, an existing file is appended to in the XYcur option.
*        The suggested default is FALSE.  It is only available in
*        cursor mode with the "XYcur" option.
*     XYFILE = FILENAME (Update)
*        Name of the text file to which pixel data are written by
*        XYcur option.  The suggested default is xylist.lis.  It is
*        only available in cursor mode with the "XYcur" option.
*     XYTITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the text file in XYcur option.  For the first file
*        created this defaults to "# KAPPA - Inspect_XYcur", and
*        subsequently this becomes the suggested default. It is not
*        accessed if XYCONT is TRUE.   It is only available in cursor
*        mode with the "XYcur" option. []

*  Examples:
*     Notes:
*        Since INSPECT is an interacting, graphical and self-contained
*        monolith of applications it is not straightforward to give
*        command-line examples.  Generally, the best way to run INSPECT
*        is in cursor mode after having displayed an image.  The
*        following examples use the prompting mode.
*     inspect rulupi i canon_l sl slstart=[3,10] slend=[9,42] slice=!
*        Plots a slice from pixel (3,10) to (9,42) of the NDF called
*        rulupi to the CANON_L graphics device.
*     inspect rulupi i gdevice=x2w option=hi numbin=100 histogram=ru_hg
*        Calculates the histogram of the NDF called rulupi, reporting
*        a summary to you, and plots the histogram to the x2w device.
*        The histogram has one hundred bins and is stored in an NDF
*        called ru_hg.
*     inspect rulupi i ! option=hi numbin=100 hirep \
*        As above except no plot is made, no NDF is created, and
*        the full one hundred histogram values are reported.  In this
*        particular example the second parameter could equally well be
*        C for cursor mode since no co-ordinate information is
*        obtained.

*  Notes:
*     -  In cursor mode there must be an existing DATA picture for the
*     chosen image display stored in the graphics database.  Valid
*     cursor positions are bounded by the DATA picture.
*     -  On exit the input picture, if there was one, is made the
*     current picture on the overlay; and the last graphics plot is
*     stored in the database as a FRAME picture.  Also, if the "Device"
*     option is used a FRAME picture is stored for that device.
*     -  The Histogram NDF has an AXIS component whose the LABEL and
*     UNITS are those of the input NDF's data array; its centres are
*     in data value of the bin centre.  The NDF LABEL is "Number".
*     -  The Slice NDF has an AXIS component whose LABEL is "Pixel" and
*     centres are pixel co-ordinates from 0.5; its LABEL and UNITS are
*     propagated from the input NDF. 
*     -  The current palette entries 1 to 4 associated with the OVERLAY
*     are used as follows in the cursor mode for IMAGE_OVERLAY devices.
*     A sample slice or region, and the associated button, are drawn
*     with palette index 1.  Similarly, index 3 is used to indicate an
*     accepted slice or region.  The exit button is drawn in the colour
*     of index 2.  Index 4 is used to draw the boxes representing the
*     mouse or trackerball buttons.  Use the PAL* commands to select
*     suitable complementary colours for the image's colour table,
*     especially for palette indices 1 and 3.
*
*     For WINDOW_OVERLAY devices, all the above are drawn with the
*     colour of palette index 1, but the various colours are replaced
*     by different dashed-line patterns.  Use PALENTRY to change the
*     colour of the lines.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Get the mode of operation.
*     -  In cursor mode obtain the overlay device, start database
*     activity, activate SGS and get the zone associated with the input
*     picture.  Validate the class and attributes (colour) of the
*     device.  Check it has sufficient choices and a cursor.  Obtain
*     the last DATA picture and a zone for it.  Display information
*     about the DATA picture, and attempt to obtain a locator to the
*     NDF referenced in the picture.
*     -  Obtain the NDF via the command line, the graphics database or
*     prompting.  Get its bounds, dimensions and check the
*     dimensionality.  Map the data array.
*     -  Set the region to the whole array.
*     -  Obtain the bounds of valid cursor positions from DATA picture
*     in the database.
*     -  Obtain the line-graphics workstation, activating database
*     activity if not already done so, and obtain a zone identifier for
*     the current picture.
*     -  Initialise variables for the main loop.
*     -  Determine whether or not the option was specified on the
*     command line.  If it was set a flag to prevent looping.  Obtain
*     the option.  Clear the overlay frame zone when about to be reused
*     Clear the line-plot zone when not exiting or changing the
*     line-plot device.  If line graphics is required and slice or
*     histogram option has been selected, then see whether the plotting
*     style is to be changed.  If it is obtain the plot title, and
*     axis labels with the appropriate defaults, the number of tick
*     marks and their polarity, whether either or both axes are to be
*     logarithmic, and the line thickness.  Enter a case-like structure
*     to perform the required option.  Most are just simply a
*     subroutine call, but the following have additional method to
*     note:
*        o  Region---the flags to indicate that the histogram and
*        statistics have been calculated are both set to false.
*        o  Save---create an NDF section with the region bounds and
*        propagate the other components.
*        o  Device---if there is a current line-plot device select
*        the input zone and picture, then save a frame zone.  Reselect
*        the input picture.  In cursor mode, release the zone otherwise
*        deactivate the database.  Cancel the device and reselect the
*        overlay picture if in cursor mode.  Open the new device,
*        activating the database if necessary, and obtain a zone
*        identifier to the next picture.  If an error occurs (other than
*        abort) switch of line-plotting function and report this to the
*        user.  Again reselect the overlay picture if in cursor mode.
*        o  Statistics---Only compute them if not already derived for
*        the current region.  The standard statistics routines work on
*        the whole array, therefore create a new NDF section for the
*        region and map it.  Convert the vector positions returned by
*        the statistical subroutine to 2-d pixel indices.  Record that
*        the statistics have been calculated. Display the results.
*        o  Histogram---Use an NDF section of the region. Record that
*        the histogram is computed for the region.  Increment the plot
*        count.
*     -  Tidy the data locators and NDF system.
*     -  Tidy the line-graphics and overlay devices, resetting the
*     current picture to its input state.

*      SECTOR; Figaro: HIST, ICUR, IGCUR, ILIST, ISTAT, SLICE.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  Only real data can be processed directly.  Other data types
*     will undergo a type conversion before processing occurs.
*     -  The routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     VARIANCE, LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS and HISTORY components of an NDF,
*     and propagates all extensions to the output Region NDF.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.  Bad pixels are are excluded from statistics and are
*     indicated in reports of data values by the word INVALID.  In the
*     slice plot they appear as gaps, and they do not affect the limits
*     of the ordinate.  The same applies to zero or negative data
*     values if the plot is to have a logarithmic ordinate.  Similarly,
*     for the histogram abscissa.
*  
*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     -  Only pixel indices may be used---data co-ordinates are not
*     supported, though the statistics option will report the position
*     of the extreme values in the data co-ordinates if axis data are
*     available.  Thus the current co-ordinate system global parameter
*     is ignored.
*     -  Uses GKS7.2 in which sample mode is not implemented, and using
*     the trackerball or mouse is clunkier than using 'rubber bands'.
*     There is no zooming for inspection of fine detail.
*     -  There are lots of missing options to tailor line plots. NCAR
*     does strange things if the picture is too small.  A method to
*     circumvent the problem is being investigated.
