1 PICXY
   Creates a new FRAME picture defined by co-ordinate bounds

Usage:

   picxy lbound ubound

Description:

   This command creates a new FRAME picture in the graphics database.
   The bounds of the new picture are defined through two parameters.
   The new picture is formed within either the current or BASE
   picture, and it adopts the world co-ordinate system of that
   reference picture.  On completion the new picture becomes the
   current picture.

   This command is a synonym for picdef xy 1.0.

2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 CURRENT
CURRENT = _LOGICAL (Read)
   TRUE if the new pictures are to lie within the current picture,
   otherwise the new pictures can lie anywhere within the BASE
   picture.  In other words, when CURRENT is TRUE the current picture
   is the reference picture, and when it is FALSE the base is the
   reference picture. [FALSE]
3 DEVICE
DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
   The graphics device. [Current graphics device]
3 LBOUND
LBOUND( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
   Co-ordinates of the lower bound that defines the new picture.
   The suggested default is the bottom-left of the current picture.
3 OUTLINE
OUTLINE = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE, a box that delimits the new picture is drawn. [TRUE]
3 UBOUND
UBOUND( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
   Co-ordinates of the upper bound that defines the new picture.
   The suggested default is the top-right of the current picture.
2 Examples
picxy [0.1,0.2] [0.9,0.6]
   This creates a new FRAME picture in the base picture extending
   from (0.1,0.2) to (0.9,0.6), which becomes the new current
   picture.  An outline is drawn around the picture.

picxy ubound=[1.1,0.9] lbound=[0.1,0.2] current nooutline
   This creates a new FRAME picture in the current picture
   extending from (0.1,0.2) to (1.1,0.9), which becomes the new
   current picture.  No outline is drawn.
