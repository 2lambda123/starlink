*  Name:
*     CCG1_CM3RR

*  Purpose:
*     To combine a stack of array lines into one line, using a variety
*     of methods. REAL version.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG1_CM3RR( STACK, NPIX, NLINES, VARS, COORDS, IMETH, MINPIX,
*                      NITER, NSIGMA, ALPHA, RMIN, RMAX, RESULT, WIDTHS,
*                      COIND, WRK1, WRK2, NCON, POINT, USED, NFLAG,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine works along each line of the input stack of lines,
*     combining the data.  This variant uses a single variance for each
*     line and and does NOT propagate it.  All work is done in single
*     precision when possible and double precision when not.  Note that
*     the output array is in the processing precision.  The array NCON
*     holds the actual numbers of pixels which were used in deriving
*     the output value plus any values already present in the array;
*     thus a cumulative sum of contributing pixel numbers may be kept.

*  Arguments:

*     USED( NLINES ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Workspace used to indicate which values have been used in
*        estimating a resultant value.
*     NFLAG = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of output pixels set to bad because insufficient pixels
*        were present to form the statistic for the collapsed axis,
*        provided the minimum number of contributing data values is one.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - Various of the options are simply variations on a theme. The
*     Broadened median is just a trimmed mean with a variable trimming
*     fraction. The Mode is an iteratively carried out version of the
*     sigma clipping (or more precisely the reverse). The minmax and
*     threshold mean are also just trimmed means, but require their own
*     mechanisms.
*     - No propagation of variances is performed using this routine.
