*  Name:
*     CCG1_CM1DD

*  Purpose:
*     To combine a stack of array lines into one line, using a variety
*     of methods. DOUBLE PRECISION version.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG1_CM1DD( STACK, NPIX, NLINES, VARS, COORDS, IMETH, MINPIX,
*                      NITER, NSIGMA, ALPHA, RMIN, RMAX, RESULT, RESVAR,
*                      WIDTHS, COIND, WRK1, WRK2, PP, COVEC, NMAT, NCON,
*                      POINT, USED, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine works along each line of the input stack of lines,
*     combining the data.  This variant uses a variance array and
*     propagates them for each input value.  All work is done in
*     double precision.  Note that the output arrays are in the
*     processing precision.  The array NCON holds the actual numbers of
*     pixels which were used in deriving the output value plus any
*     values already present in the array; thus a cumulative sum of
*     contributing pixel numbers may be kept.

*  Arguments:
*     STACK( NPIX, NLINES ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The array of lines which are to be combined into a single line.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)

*        24 = Root mean square
*        25 = Absolute mean deviation
*        31 = Maximum
*        32 = Minimum
*        33 = Co-ordinate of maximum

*        Workspace used to indicate which values have been used in
*        estimating a resultant value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - Various of the options are simply variations on a theme. The
*     Broadened median is just a trimmed mean with a variable trimming
*     fraction. The Mode is an iteratively carried out version of the
*     sigma clipping (or more precisely the reverse). The minmax and
*     threshold mean are also just trimmed means, but require their own
*     mechanisms.
*
*     - The 'propagation' of the input variances assumes that the input
*     data are fairly represented by a normal distribution. This fact
*     is used together with the 'order statistics' of a normal
*     population to form a new variance estimate. The order statistics
*     are not independent so have non-zero covariances (off diagonal
*     components of the variance-covariance matrix). All 'trimmed
*     means' of any description use the order of the values to
*     estimate which values are corrupt. This applies to all the
*     methods supported here except the mean which rejects no data. The
*     variance used to represent the input normal population is the
*     reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocal variances. We have no
*     other estimate of this value except from the population itself.
*
*     - NMAT = NLINES * ( NLINES + 1 )/ 2 at least.

*  History:
*     21-MAY-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version. Revamping of routine structure to increase
*        efficiency and keep in line with new routines.
*     30-JAN-1998 (PDRAPER):
*        Added MEDCLIP method.
*     16-NOV-1998 (PDRAPER):
*        Added fast median.
*     14-DEC-2001 (DSB):
*        Added unweighted mean method.
*     1-NOV-2002 (DSB):
*        Added workspace argument to CCD1_ORVAR.
*     27-AUG-2003 (DSB):
*        Added IMETH 300 to provide a means of estimating the output
*        variances for large samples, for which the memory requirements
*        for the COVEC array would be too large.
*     2005 December 22 (MJC):
*        Added several translations for new estimators and moments 
*        (IMETH=12 upwards except 300).
*     2005 December 24 (MJC):
*        Added mean absolute deviation.
*     2005 December 27 (MJC):
*        Added standard deviation.
*     2005 December 28 (MJC):
*        Added root mean square.
*     2005 December 29 (MJC):
*        Add summation method.
*     2006 January 2 (MJC):
*        Add COORDS argument.
*     2006 January 5 (MJC):
*        Add COIND argument.
*     2006 January 6 (MJC):
*        Add WIDTHS argument and calls for IMETH = 21, 22, 23.
*     2006 January 26 (MJC):
*        Made COORDS and WIDTHS per pixel.  Change calls to
*        reflect new APIs for CCG1_IWC1 and CCG1_IWD1.
*     2006 January 27 (MJC):
*        Use CCG1_I2WC instead of KPG1_VASV to cope with the
*        two-dimensional co-ordinate array.  Derive the widths for
*        IMETH = 21 from the co-ordinates.
*     2007 November 17 (MJC):
*        WIDTHS is returned, not supplied, so move it in the API.
