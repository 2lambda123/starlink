      SUBROUTINE NDFCOPY( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDFCOPY

*  Purpose:
*     Copies an NDF (or NDF section) to a new location.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDFCOPY( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application copies an NDF to a new location.  By supplying an
*     NDF section as input it may be used to extract a subset, or to
*     change the size or dimensionality of an NDF. A second NDF may
*     also be supplied to act as a shape template, and hence to define
*     the region of the first NDF which is to be copied.
*
*     Any unused space will be eliminated by the copying operation
*     performed by this routine, so it may be used as a way of
*     compressing NDF structures from which components have been
*     deleted.  This ability also makes NDFCOPY a useful alternative to
*     SETBOUND in cases where an NDF's size is to be reduced.

*  Usage:
*     ndfcopy in out

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of an array component in the input NDF (specified by
*        Parameter IN) that will become the DATA_ARRAY in the output NDF
*        (specified by Parameter OUT).  It has the following options.
*
*          "Data"     -- Each array component present is propagated to
*                        its counterpart.
*          "Variance" -- The VARIANCE component in the input NDF becomes
*                        the DATA_ARRAY in the output NDF and retains
*                        its data type.  The original DATA_ARRAY is not
*                        copied.
*          "Error"    -- The square root of the VARIANCE component in
*                        the input NDF becomes the DATA_ARRAY in the
*                        output NDF and retains the VARIANCE's data
*                        type.  The original DATA_ARRAY and VARIANCE
*                        components are not copied.
*          "Quality" --  The QUALITY component in the input NDF becomes
*                        the DATA_ARRAY in the output NDF and will be
*                        data type _UBYTE.  The original DATA_ARRAY and
*                        VARIANCE components are not copied.
*        ["Data"]
*     EXTEN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If set to FALSE (the default), any NDFs contained within
*        extensions of the input NDF are copied to equivalent places
*        within the output NDF without change. If set TRUE, then any
*        extension NDFs which have the same bounds as the base input
*        NDF are padded or trimmed as necessary in order to ensure that
*        they have the same bounds as the output NDF. [FALSE]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF (or section) which is to be copied.
*     LIKE = NDF (Read)
*        This parameter may be used to supply an NDF to be used as a
*        shape template during the copying operation.  If such a
*        template is supplied, then its shape will be used to select a
*        matching section from the input NDF before copying takes
*        place.  By default, no template will be used and the shape of
*        the output NDF will therefore match that of the input NDF (or
*        NDF section).  The shape of the template in either pixel
*        indices or the current WCS Frame may be used, as selected by
*        Parameter LIKEWCS. [!]
*     LIKEWCS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then the WCS bounds of the template supplied via
*        Parameter LIKE are used to decide on the bounds of the output
*        NDF.  Otherwise, the pixel bounds of the template are used.
*        [FALSE]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF data structure.
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A title for the output NDF.  A null value (the default) will
*        cause the title of the NDF supplied for Parameter IN to be
*        used instead. [!]
*     TRIM = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then the number of pixel axes in the output NDF will
*        be reduced if necessary to remove any pixel axes which span
*        only a single pixel.  For instance if "stokes" is a
*        three-dimensional data cube with pixel bounds
*        (1:100,-50:40,1:3), and the Parameter IN is given the value
*        "stokes(,,2)", then the dimensionality of the output depends
*        on the setting of TRIM: if TRIM=FALSE, the output is
*        three-dimensional with pixel bounds (1:100,-50:40,2:2), and if
*        TRIM=TRUE the output is two-dimensional with pixel bounds
*        (1:100,-50:40).  In this example, the third pixel axis spans
*        only a single pixel and is consequently removed if TRIM=TRUE.
*        [FALSE]
*     TRIMBAD = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then the pixel bounds of the output NDF are trimmed to
*        exclude any border of bad pixels within the input NDF. That is,
*        the output NDF will be the smallest NDF that encloses all good
*        data values in the input NDF. [FALSE]
*     TRIMWCS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed if Parameter TRIM is TRUE.  It
*        controls the number of axes in the current WCS co-ordinate
*        Frame of the output NDF.  If TRIMWCS=TRUE, then the current
*        Frame in the output NDF will have the same number of axes as
*        there are pixel axes in the output NDF.  If this involves
*        removing axes, then the axes to retain are specified by
*        Parameter USEAXIS.  If TRIMWCS=FALSE, then all axes are
*        retained in the current WCS Frame of the output NDF.  Using the
*        example in the description of the TRIM parameter, if the input
*        NDF "stokes" has a three-dimensional current WCS Frame with
*        axes (RA,Dec,Stokes) and TRIMWSC=TRUE, then an axis will be
*        removed from the current Frame to make it two-dimensional (that
*        is, to match the number of pixel axes remaining after the
*        removal of insignificant pixel axes).  The choice of which two
*        axes to retain is controlled by Parameter USEAXIS.  If, on the
*        other hand, TRIMWCS was set to FALSE, then the output NDF would
*        still have two pixel axes, but the current WCS Frame would
*        retain all three axes from the input NDF.  If one or more
*        current Frame axes are removed, the transformation from the
*        current Frame to pixel Frame may become undefined resulting in
*        some WCS operations being unusable.  The inverse of this
*        transformation (from pixel Frame to current Frame) is
*        unchanged however. [TRUE]
*     USEAXIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed if TRIM and TRIMWCS are both
*        TRUE, and some axes need to be removed from the current WCS
*        Frame of the output NDF.  It gives the axes which are to be
*        retained in the current WCS Frame of the output NDF.  Each axis
*        can be specified using one of the following options.
*
*        - An integer index of an axis within the current Frame of the
*        input NDF (in the range 1 to the number of axes in the current
*        Frame).
*
*        - An axis symbol string such as "RA" or "VRAD".
*
*        - A generic option where "SPEC" requests the spectral axis,
*        "TIME" selects the time axis, "SKYLON" and "SKYLAT" picks the
*        sky longitude and latitude axes respectively.  Only those axis
*        domains present are available as options.

*        The dynamic default selects the axes with the same indices as
*        the pixel axes being copied.  The value should be given as a
*        comma-separated list.  []

*  Examples:
*     ndfcopy infile outfile
*        Copies the contents of the NDF structure infile to the new
*        structure outfile.  Any unused space will be eliminated during
*        the copying operation.
*     ndfcopy infile outfile comp=var
*        As the previous example except that the VARIANCE component of
*        NDF infile becomes the DATA_ARRAY of NDF outfile.
*     ndfcopy in=data1(3:40,-3:17) out=data2 title="Extracted section"
*        Copies the section (3:40,-3:17) of the NDF called data1 to a
*        new NDF called data2.  The output NDF is assigned the new title
*        "Extracted section", which replaces the title derived from the
*        input NDF.
*     ndfcopy galaxy newgalaxy like=oldgalaxy
*        Copies a section of the NDF called galaxy to form a new NDF
*        called newgalaxy.  The section which is copied will correspond
*        in shape with the template oldgalaxy.  Thus, after the copying
*        operation, both newgalaxy and oldgalaxy will have the same
*        pixel-index bounds.
*     ndfcopy aa(20~11,20~11) bb like=aa
*        Copies from the NDF section consisting of an 11x11 pixel
*        region of aa centred on pixel (20,20), into a new NDF called
*        bb.  The shape of the region copied is made to match the
*        original shape of aa.  The effect is to extract the selected
*        square region of pixels into a new NDF of the same shape as
*        the original, setting the surrounding region to the bad-pixel
*        value.
*     ndfcopy survey(12h23m:12h39m,11d:13d50m,) virgo trimwcs trim
*        Copies a section specified by equatorial co-ordinate ranges
*        from the three-dimensional NDF called survey, whose third pixel
*        axis has only one element, to a two-dimensional NDF called
*        virgo.  Information on the third WCS axis is removed too.

*     KAPPA: SETBOUND; Figaro: ISUBSET.

*  Implementation Status:
*     If present, an NDF's TITLE, LABEL, UNITS, DATA, VARIANCE, QUALITY,
*     AXIS WCS and HISTORY components are copied by this routine,
*     together with all extensions.  The output NDF's title may be
*     modified, if required, by specifying a new value via the TITLE
*     parameter.
