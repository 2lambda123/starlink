      SUBROUTINE WCSATTRIB( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     WCSATTRIB

*  Purpose:
*     Manages attribute values associated with the WCS component of an 
*     NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL WCSATTRIB( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application can be used to manage the values of attributes 
*     associated with the current co-ordinate Frame of an NDF (title, 
*     axis labels, axis units, etc.).
*
*     Each attribute has a name, a value, and a state.  This 
*     application accesses all attribute values as character strings, 
*     converting to and from other data types as necessary.  The 
*     attribute state is a Boolean flag (i.e. TRUE or FALSE) indicating
*     whether or not a value has been assigned to the attribute.  If no
*     value has been assigned to an attribute, then it adopts a default
*     value until an explicit value is assigned to it.  An attribute 
*     value can be cleared, causing the attribute to revert to its 
*     default value.
*
*     The operation performed by this application is controlled by 
*     parameter MODE, and can be:
*
*     -  display the value of an attribute;
*     -  set a new value for a single attribute;
*     -  set new values for a list of attributes;
*     -  clear an attribute value; and
*     -  test the state of an attribute.
*
*     Note, the attributes of the PIXEL, GRID and AXIS Frames are 
*     managed internally by the NDF library.  They may be examined 
*     using this application, but an error is reported if any attempt 
*     is made to change them.  The exception to this is that the DOMAIN
*     attribute may be changed, resulting in a copy of the Frame being
*     added to the WCS component of the NDF with the new Domain name. 
*     The AXIS Frame is derived from the AXIS structures within the 
*     NDF, so the AXLABEL and AXUNITS commands may be used to change 
*     the axis label and units string respectively for the AXIS Frame.

*  Usage:
*     wcsattrib ndf mode name newval

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The operation to be performed on the attribute specified by
*        parameter NAME.  It can be one of the following.
*
*        - "Get" -- The current value of the attribute is displayed on 
*        the screen and written to output parameter VALUE. If the 
*        attribute has not yet been assigned a value (or has been 
*        cleared), then the default value will be displayed.
*
*        - "MSet" -- Assigns new values to multiple attributes. The
*        attribute names and values are obtained using parameter 
*        SETTING.
*
*        - "Set" -- Assigns a new value, given by parameter NEWVAL, to
*        the attribute. 
*
*        - "Test" -- Displays "TRUE" if the attribute has been assigned
*        a value, and "FALSE" otherwise (in which case the attribute 
*        will adopt its default value). This flag is written to the 
*        output parameter STATE.
*
*        - "Clear" -- Clears the current attribute value, causing it to
*        revert to its default value. 
*
*        The initial suggested default is "Get".
*     NAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        The attribute name. Not used if MODE is "MSet".
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The NDF to be modified or read.  When MODE="Get", the access
*        is Read only.
*     NEWVAL = LITERAL (Read)
*        The new value to assign to the attribute.  It is only used if
*        MODE is "Set".
*     REMAP = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Only accessed if MODE is "Set". If REMAP is TRUE, then the
*        Mappings which connect the current Frame to the other Frames
*        within the WCS FrameSet will be modified (if necessary) to
*        maintain the FrameSet integrity. For instance, if the current
*        Frame of the NDF represents FK5 RA and DEC, and you change 
*        System from "FK5" to "Galactic", then the Mappings which 
*        connect the SKY Frame to the other Frames (e.g. PIXEL, AXIS) 
*        will be modified so that each pixel corresponds to the correct
*        Galactic co-ordinates. If REMAP is FALSE, then the Mappings 
*        will not be changed. This can be useful if the FrameSet has
*        incorrect attribute values for some reason, which need to be 
*        corrected without altering the Mappings to take account of the
*        change. [TRUE]
*     SETTING = LITERAL (Read)
*        Only accessed if MODE is set to "MSet". It should hold a 
*        comma-separated list of "<attribute>=<value>" strings, where
*        <attribute> is the name of an attribute and <value> is the 
*        value to assign to the attribute. 
*     STATE = _LOGICAL (Write)
*        On exit, this holds the state of the attribute on entry to 
*         this application.  It is not used if MODE is "MSet".
*     VALUE = LITERAL (Write)
*        On exit, this holds the value of the attribute on entry to 
*        this application.  It is not used if MODE is "MSet".

*  Examples:
*     wcsattrib my_spec set System freq
*        This sets the System attribute of the current co-ordinate
*        Frame in the NDF called my_Spec so that the Frame represents
*        frequency (this assumes the current Frame is a SpecFrame). 
*        The Mappings between the current Frame and the other Frames
*        are modified to take account of the change of system.
*     wcsattrib my_spec mset setting='unit(1)=km/s,system(1)=vrad'
*        This sets new values of "km/s" and "vrad" simultaneously for 
*        the Unit and System attributes for the first axis of the NDF 
*        called my_spec.
*     wcsattrib ngc5128 set title "Polarization map of Centaurus-A"
*        This sets the Title attribute of the current co-ordinate Frame
*        in the NDF called ngc5128 to the string "Polarization map of 
*        Centaurus-A".
*     wcsattrib my_data set domain saved_pixel
*        This sets the Domain attribute of the current co-ordinate 
*        Frame in the NDF called my_data to the string SAVED_PIXEL. 
*     wcsattrib my_data set format(1) "%10.5G"
*        This sets the Format attribute for axis 1 in the current 
*        co-ordinate Frame in the NDF called my_data, so that axis 
*        values are formatted as floating-point values using a minimum 
*        field width of ten characters, and displaying five significant
*        figures. An exponent is used if necessary.
*     wcsattrib ngc5128 set format(2) bdms.2
*        This sets the Format attribute for axis 2 in the current 
*        co-ordinate Frame in the NDF called ngc5128, so that axis 
*        values are formatted as separate degrees, minutes and seconds 
*        fields, separated by blanks. The seconds field has two decimal
*        places. This assumes the current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF 
*        is a celestial co-ordinate Frame.
*     wcsattrib my_data get label(1)
*        This displays the label associated with the first axis of the 
*        current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF called my_data. A default
*        label is displayed if no value has been set for this
*        attribute.
*     wcsattrib my_data test label(1)
*        This displays "TRUE" if a value has been set for the Label 
*        attribute for the first axis of the current co-ordinate Frame 
*        in the NDF called my_data, and "FALSE" otherwise.
*     wcsattrib my_data clear label(1)
*        This clears the Label attribute for the first axis of the 
*        current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF called my_data. It 
*        reverts to its default value.
*     wcsattrib my_data set equinox J2000 remap=no
*        This assumes that the Equinox attribute for the current
*        co-ordinate Frame within NDF "my_data" has been set to some
*        incorrect value, which needs to be corrected to "J2000". The
*        REMAP parameter is set false, which prevents the inter-Frame
*        Mappings from being altered to take account of the new Equinox
*        value. This means that each pixel in the NDF will retain its
*        original RA and DEC values (but they will now be interpreted
*        as J2000). If REMAP had been left at its default value of
*        TRUE, then the RA and DEC associated with each pixel would 
*        have been modified in order to precess them from the original
*        (incorrect) equinox to J2000.

*  Notes:
*     -  An error is reported if an attempt is made to set or clear the
*     Base Frame in the WCS component.
*     -  The Domain names GRID, AXIS and PIXEL are reserved for use by
*     the NDF library and an error will be reported if an attempt is 
*     made to assign one of these values to any Frame.
