      SUBROUTINE WCSFRAME( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     WCSFRAME

*  Purpose:
*     Change the current co-ordinate Frame in the WCS component of an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL WCSFRAME( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application displays the current co-ordinate Frame associated
*     with an NDF and then allows the user to specify a new Frame. The
*     current co-ordinate Frame determines the co-ordinate system in
*     which positions within the NDF will be expressed when communicating
*     with the user. 
*
*     Having selected a new current co-ordinate Frame, its attributes
*     (such the specific system it uses to represents points within its 
*     Domain, its units, etc.) can be changed using KAPPA command
*     WCSATTRIB.

*  Usage:
*     wcsframe ndf frame epoch

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     EPOCH = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        If a "Sky Co-ordinate System" specification is supplied (using 
*        parameter FRAME) for a celestial co-ordinate system, then an epoch 
*        value is needed to qualify it. This is the epoch at which the 
*        supplied sky positions were determined. It should be given as a 
*        decimal years value, with or without decimal places  ("1996.8" for 
*        example). Such values are interpreted as a Besselian epoch if less 
*        than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch otherwise. 
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string specifying the new co-ordinate Frame. If a null parameter 
*        value is supplied, then the current Frame is left unchanged. The
*        suggested default is the Domain (or index if the Domain is not
*        set) of the current Frame. The string can be one of the following:
*
*        - A domain name such as SKY, SPECTRUM, AXIS, PIXEL, etc. The two
*        "pseudo-domains" WORLD and DATA may be supplied and will be
*        translated into PIXEL and AXIS respectively, so long as the WCS
*        component of the NDF does not contain Frames with these domains.
*
*        - An integer value giving the index of the required Frame within
*        the WCS component.
*
*        - A "Sky Co-ordinate System" (SCS) value such as EQUAT(J2000) (see 
*        section "Sky Co-ordinate Systems" in SUN/95). Using an SCS value
*        is equivalent to specifying "SKY" for this parameter and then setting 
*        the System attribute (to "FK5", "Galactic", etc.) using KAPPA command 
*        WCSATTRIB. The specific system used to describe positions in other 
*        Domains (SPECTRUM, for instance) must be set using WCSATTRIB.
*
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The NDF data structure in which the current co-ordinate Frame is to 
*        be modified.

*  Examples:
*     wcsframe m51 pixel
*        This chooses pixel co-ordinates for the current co-ordinate
*        Frame in the NDF m51. 
*     wcsframe m51 sky
*        This chooses celestial co-ordinates for the current co-ordinate
*        Frame in the NDF m51 (if available). The specific celestial 
*        co-ordinate system (FK5, Galactic, etc.) will depend on the contents 
*        of the WCS component of the NDF, but may be changed by setting a 
*        new value for the System attribute using the WCSATTRIB command.
*     wcsframe m51 spectrum
*        This chooses spectral co-ordinates for the current co-ordinate
*        Frame in the NDF m51 (if available). The specific spectral 
*        co-ordinate system (wavelength, frequency, etc) will depend on the 
*        contents of the WCS component of the NDF, but may be changed by 
*        setting a new value for the System attribute using the WCSATTRIB 
*        command.
*     wcsframe m51 equ(J2000) epoch=1998.2
*        This chooses equatorial (RA/DEC) co-ordinates referred to the
*        equinox at Julian epoch 2000.0 for the current co-ordinate
*        Frame in the NDF m51. The positions were determined at the
*        Julian epoch 1998.2 (this is needed to correct positions for
*        the fictitious proper motions which may be introduced when 
*        converting between different celestial co-ordinate systems).
*     wcsframe m51 2
*        This chooses the second co-ordinate Frame in the WCS component
*        of the NDF.
*     wcsframe m51 data
*        This chooses a co-ordinate Frame with domain DATA if one exists, 
*        or the AXIS co-ordinate Frame otherwise.
*     wcsframe m51 world
*        This chooses a co-ordinate Frame with domain WORLD if one exists, 
*        or the PIXEL co-ordinate Frame otherwise.

*     KAPPA: NDFTRACE, WCSREMOVE, WCSCOPY, WCSATTRIB

*  Notes:
*     -  The current co-ordinate Frame in the supplied NDF is not displayed 
*     if a value is assigned to parameter FRAME on the command line.
*     -  This routine may add a new co-ordinate Frame into the WCS component 
*     of the NDF.
*     -  The NDFTRACE command can be used to examine the co-ordinate
*     Frames in the WCS component of an NDF.
