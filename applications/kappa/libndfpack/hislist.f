      SUBROUTINE HISLIST( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     HISLIST

*  Purpose:
*     Lists NDF history records.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL HISLIST( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This lists all the history records in an NDF.  The reported
*     information comprises the date, time, and application name,
*     and optionally the history text.

*  Usage:
*     hislist ndf

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BRIEF = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This controls whether a summary or the full history information
*        is reported.  BRIEF=TRUE requests that only the date and
*        application name in each history record is listed.  BRIEF=FALSE
*        causes the task to report the history text in addition.
*        [FALSE]
*     NDF = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF whose history information is to be reported.

*  Examples:
*     hislist vcc953
*        This lists the full history information for the NDF called
*        vcc935.  The information comprises the names of the
*        applications and the times they were used, and the associated
*        history text.
*     hislist vcc953 brief
*        This gives a summary of the history information for the NDF
*        called vcc935.  It comprises the names of the applications
*        and the times they were used.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: HISCOM, HISSET, NDFTRACE.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     There is no facility to list only certain history records, say by
*     time or application name.
