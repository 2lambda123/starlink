      SUBROUTINE HISSET( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     HISSET

*  Purpose:
*     Sets the NDF history update mode.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL HISSET( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This task controls the level of history recording in an NDF,
*     and can also erase the history information.
*
*     The level is called the history update mode and it is a permanent
*     attribute of the HISTORY component of the NDF, and remains with
*     the NDF and any NDF created therefrom until the history is erased
*     or the update mode is modified (say by this task).

*  Usage:
*     hisset ndf [mode] ok=?

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The history update mode.  It can take one of the following
*        values.
*
*           "Disabled"  ---  No history recording is to take place.
*           "Erase"     ---  Erases the history of the NDF.
*           "Normal"    ---  Normal history recording is required.
*           "Quiet"     ---  Only brief history information is to be
*                            recorded.
*           "Verbose"   ---  The fullest-possible history information
*                            is to be recorded.
*
*        The suggested default is "Normal".  ["Normal"]
*     NDF = (Read and Write)
*        The NDF whose history update mode to be modified or history
*        information erased.
*     OK = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This is used to confirm whether or not the history should be
*        erased.  OK=TRUE lets the history records be erased; if
*        OK=FALSE the history is retained and a message will be issued
*        to this effect.

*  Examples:
*     hisset final
*        This sets the history-recording level to be normal for the NDF
*        called final.
*     hisset final erase ok
*        This erases the history information from the NDF called final.
*     hisset mode=disabled ndf=spectrum
*        This disables history recording in the NDF called spectrum.
*     hisset test42 v
*        This sets the history-recording level to be verbose for the NDF
*        called test42 so that the fullest-possible history is included.
*     hisset ndf=test42 mode=q
*        This sets the history-recording level to be quiet for the NDF
*        called test42, so that only brief information is recorded.

*  Notes:
*     -  A HISTORY component is created if it does not exist within the
*     NDF, except for MODE="Erase".
*     -  The task records the new history update mode within the
*     history records, even if MODE="Disabled" provided the mode has
*     changed.  Thus the history information will show where there may
*     be gaps in the recording.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: HISCOM, HISLIST, NDFTRACE.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     There is no facility to erase history records before a given date
*     or number.
