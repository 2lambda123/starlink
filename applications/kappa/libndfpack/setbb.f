      SUBROUTINE SETBB( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SETBB

*  Purpose:
*     Sets a new value for the quality bad-bits mask of an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SETBB( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application sets a new value for the bad-bits mask
*     associated with the quality component of an NDF.  This 8-bit mask
*     is used to select which of the bits in the quality array should
*     normally be used to generate "bad" pixels when the NDF is
*     accessed.
*
*     Wherever a bit is set to 1 in the bad-bits mask, the
*     corresponding bit will be extracted from the NDF's quality array
*     value for each pixel (the other quality bits being ignored).  A
*     pixel is then considered "bad" if any of the extracted quality
*     bits is set to 1.  Effectively, the bad-bits mask therefore allows
*     selective activation of any of the eight 1-bit masks which can be
*     stored in the quality array.

*  Usage:
*     setbb ndf bb

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AND = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        By default, the value supplied via the BB parameter will be
*        used literally as the new bad-bits mask value.  However, if a
*        TRUE value is given for the AND parameter, then a bit-wise
*        `AND' will first be performed with the old value of the mask.
*        This facility allows individual bits in within the mask to be
*        cleared (i.e. reset to zero) without affecting the current
*        state of other bits (see the "Examples" section).
*
*        The AND parameter is not used if a TRUE value is given for the
*        OR parameter. [FALSE]
*     BB = LITERAL (Read)
*        The new integer value for the bad-bits mask.  This may either
*        be specified in normal decimal notation, or may be given using
*        binary, octal or hexadecimal notation by adding a "B", "O" or
*        "Z" prefix (respectively) to the appropriate string of digits.
*        The value supplied should lie in the range 0 to 255 decimal (or
*        8 bits of binary).
*
*        It may also be specified as a comma-separated list of quality
*        names. A quality name is a symbolic name that identifies a
*        specific quality bit (quality names can be defined using
*        SETQUAL, and displayed using SHOWQUAL).
*
*        If the AND and OR parameters are both FALSE, then the value
*        supplied will be used directly as the new mask value.
*        However, if either of these logical parameters is set to TRUE,
*        then an appropriate bit-wise `AND' or `OR' operation with the
*        old mask value will first be performed.
*
*        The default value suggested when prompting for this value is
*        chosen so as to leave the original mask value unchanged.
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The NDF whose bad-bits mask is to be modified.
*     OR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        By default, the value supplied via the BB parameter will be
*        used literally as the new bad-bits mask value.  However, if a
*        TRUE value is given for the OR parameter, then a bit-wise `OR'
*        will first be performed with the old value of the mask.  This
*        facility allows individual bits in within the mask to be set
*        to 1 without affecting the current state of other bits (see
*        the "Examples" section).  [FALSE]

*  Examples:
*     setbb myframe 3
*        Sets the bad-bits mask value for the quality component of the
*        NDF called myframe to the value 3.  This means that bits 1 and
*        2 of the associated quality array will be used to generate bad
*        pixels.
*     setbb myframe "SKY,BACK"
*        Sets the bad-bits mask value for the quality component of the
*        NDF called myframe so that any pixel that is flagged with
*        either of the two qualities "SKY" or "BACK" will be set bad.
*        The NDF should contain information that associates each of
*        these quality names with a specific bit in the quality array.
*        Such information can for instance be created using the SETQUAL
*        command.
*     setbb ndf=myframe bb=b11
*        This example performs the same operation as above, but in this
*        case the new mask value has been specified using binary
*        notation.
*     setbb xspec b10001000 or
*        Causes the bad-bits mask value in the NDF called xspec to
*        undergo a bit-wise `OR' operation with the binary value
*        10001000.  This causes bits 4 and 8 to be set without changing
*        the state of any other bits in the mask.
*     setbb quasar ze7 and
*        Causes the bad-bits mask value in the NDF called quasar to
*        undergo a bit-wise `AND' operation with the hexadecimal value
*        E7 (binary 11100111).  This causes bits 4 and 5 to be cleared
*        (i.e. reset to zero) without changing the state of any other
*        bits in the mask.

*  Notes:
*     The bad-bits value will be disregarded if the NDF supplied does
*     not have a quality component present.  A warning message will be
*     issued if this should occur.
