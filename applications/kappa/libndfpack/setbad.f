      SUBROUTINE SETBAD( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SETBAD

*  Purpose:
*     Sets new bad-pixel flag values for an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SETBAD( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application sets new logical values for the bad-pixel flags
*     associated with an NDF's data and/or variance arrays.  It may
*     either be used to test whether bad pixels are actually present in
*     these arrays and to set their bad-pixel flags accordingly, or to
*     set explicit TRUE or FALSE values for these flags.

*  Usage:
*     setbad ndf [value]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DATA = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls whether the NDF's data array is
*        processed.  If a TRUE value is supplied (the default), then it
*        will be processed. Otherwise it will not be processed, so that
*        the variance array (if present) may be considered on its own.
*        The DATA and VARIANCE parameters should not both be set to
*        FALSE.  [TRUE]
*     MODIFY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a TRUE value is supplied for this parameter (the default),
*        then the NDF's bad-pixel flags will be permanently modified if
*        necessary.  If a FALSE value is supplied, then no modifications
*        will be made.  This latter mode allows the routine to be used
*        to check for the presence of bad pixels without changing the
*        current state of an NDF's bad-pixel flags.  It also allows the
*        routine to be used on NDFs for which write access is not
*        available. [TRUE]
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The NDF in which bad pixels are to be checked for, and/or
*        whose bad-pixel flags are to be modified.  (Note that setting
*        the MODIFY parameter to FALSE makes it possible to check for
*        bad pixels without permanently modifying the NDF.)
*     VALUE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a null (!) value is supplied for this parameter (the
*        default), then the routine will check to see whether any bad
*        pixels are present.  This will only involve testing the value
*        of each pixel if the bad-pixel flag value is initially TRUE,
*        in which case it will be reset to FALSE if no bad pixels are
*        found.  If the bad-pixel flag is initially FALSE, then it will
*        remain unchanged.
*
*        If a logical (TRUE or FALSE) value is supplied for this
*        parameter, then it indicates the new bad-pixel flag value
*        which is to be set.  Setting a TRUE value indicates to later
*        applications that there may be bad pixels present in the NDF,
*        for which checks must be made.  Conversely, setting a FALSE
*        value indicates that there are definitely no bad pixels
*        present, in which case later applications need not check for
*        them and should interpret the pixel values in the NDF
*        literally.
*
*        The VALUE parameter is not used (a null value is assumed) if
*        the MODIFY parameter is set to FALSE indicating that the NDF
*        is not to be permanently modified. [!]
*     VARIANCE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls whether the NDF's variance array is
*        processed.  If a TRUE value is supplied (the default), then it
*        will be processed. Otherwise it will not be processed, so that
*        the data array may be considered on its own.  The DATA and
*        VARIANCE parameters should not both be set to FALSE.  [TRUE]

*  Examples:
*     setbad ngc1097
*        Checks the data and variance arrays (if present) in the NDF
*        called ngc1097 for the presence of bad pixels.  If the initial
*        bad-pixel flag values indicate that bad pixels may be present,
*        but none are found, then the bad-pixel flags will be reset to
*        FALSE.  The action taken will be reported.
*     setbad ndf=ngc1368 nomodify
*        Performs the same checks as described above, this time on the
*        NDF called ngc1368.  The presence or absence of bad pixels is
*        reported, but the NDF is not modified.
*     setbad myfile nodata
*        Checks the variance array (if present) in the NDF called
*        myfile for the presence of bad pixels, and modifies its
*        bad-pixel flag accordingly.  Specifying "nodata" inhibits
*        processing of the data array, whose bad-pixel flag is left
*        unchanged.
*     setbad halpha false
*        Sets the bad-pixel flag for the NDF called halpha to FALSE.
*        Any pixel values which might previously have been regarded as
*        bad will subsequently be interpreted literally as valid
*        pixels.
*     setbad hbeta true
*        Sets the bad-pixel flags for the NDF called hbeta to be TRUE.
*        If any pixels have the special "bad" value, then they will
*        subsequently be regarded as invalid pixels.  Note that if this
*        is followed by a further command such as "setbad hbeta", then
*        an actual check will be made to see whether any pixels have
*        this special value.  The bad-pixel flags will be returned to
*        FALSE if they do not.

*  Bad-Pixel Flag Values:
*     If a bad-pixel flag is TRUE, it indicates that the associated NDF
*     array may contain the special "bad" value and that affected
*     pixels are to be regarded as invalid.  Subsequent applications
*     will need to check for such pixels and, if found, take account of
*     them.
*
*     Conversely, if a bad-pixel flag value is FALSE, it indicates that
*     there are no bad pixels present.  In this case, any special "bad"
*     values appearing in the array are to be interpreted literally as
*     valid pixel values.

*  Quality Components:
*     Bad pixels may also be introduced into an NDF's data and variance
*     arrays implicitly through the presence of an associated NDF
*     quality component.  This application will not take account of such
*     a component, nor will it modify it.
*
*     However, if either of the NDF's data or variance arrays do not
*     contain any bad pixels themselves, a check will be made to see
*     whether a quality component is present.  If it is (and its
*     associated bad-bits mask is non-zero), then a warning message
*     will be issued indicating that bad pixels may be introduced via
*     this quality component.  If required, these bad pixels may be
*     eliminated either by setting the bad-bits mask to zero or by
*     erasing the quality component.
