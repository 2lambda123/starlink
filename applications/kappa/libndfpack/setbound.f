      SUBROUTINE SETBOUND( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SETBOUND

*  Purpose:
*     Sets new bounds for an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SETBOUND( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application sets new pixel-index bounds for an NDF, either
*     trimming it to remove unwanted pixels, or padding it with bad
*     pixels to achieve the required shape.  The number of dimensions
*     may also be altered.  The NDF is accessed in update mode and
*     modified in situ, preserving existing pixel values which lie
*     within the new bounds.

*  Usage:
*     setbound ndf

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     LIKE = NDF (Read)
*        This parameter may be used to specify an NDF which is to be
*        used as a shape template.  If such a template is supplied, then
*        its bounds will be used to determine the new shape required
*        for the NDF specified via the NDF parameter.  By default no
*        template will be used and the new shape will be determined
*        by means of a section specification applied to the NDF being
*        modified (see the "Examples"). [!]
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The NDF whose bounds are to be modified.  In normal use, an NDF
*        section will be specified for this parameter (see the
*        "Examples") and the routine will use the bounds of this section
*        to determine the new bounds required for the base NDF from
*        which the section is drawn.  The base NDF is then accessed in
*        update mode and its bounds are modified in situ to make them
*        equal to the bounds of the section specified.  If a section is
*        not specified, then the NDF's shape will only be modified if a
*        shape template is supplied via the LIKE parameter.

*  Examples:
*     setbound datafile(1:512,1:512)
*        Sets the pixel-index bounds of the NDF called datafile to be
*        (1:512,1:512), either by trimming off unwanted pixels or by
*        padding out with bad pixels, as necessary.
*     setbound alpha(:7,56:)
*        Modifies the NDF called alpha so that its first dimension has
*        an upper bound of 7 and its second dimension has a lower bound
*        of 56.  The lower bound of the first dimension and the upper
*        bound of the second dimension remain unchanged.
*     setbound ndf=kg74b(,5500.0~100.0)
*        Sets new bounds for the NDF called kg74b.  The bounds of the
*        first dimension are left unchanged, but those of the second
*        dimension are changed so that this dimension has an extent of
*        100.0 centred on 5500.0, using the physical units in which
*        this second dimension is calibrated.
*     setbound newspec like=oldspec
*        Changes the bounds of the NDF newspec so that they are equal
*        to the bounds of the NDF called oldspec.
*     setbound xflux(:2048) like=xflux
*        Extracts the section extending from the lower bound of the
*        1-dimensional NDF called xflux up to pixel 2048, and then
*        modifies the bounds of this section to be equal to the
*        original bounds of xflux, replacing xflux with this new NDF.
*        This leaves the final shape unchanged, but sets all pixels
*        from 2049 onwards to be equal to the bad-pixel value.
*     setbound whole(5:10,5:10) like=whole(0:15,0:15)
*        Extracts the section (5:10,5:10) from the base NDF called
*        whole and then sets its bounds to be equal to those of the
*        section whole(0:15,0:15), replacing whole with this new NDF.
*        The effect is to select a 6-pixel-square region from the
*        original NDF and then to pad it with a 5-pixel-wide border of
*        bad pixels.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: NDFCOPY, SETORIGIN; Figaro: ISUBSET.

*  Notes:
*     This routine modifies the NDF in situ and will not release unused
*     file space if the size of the NDF is reduced.  If recovery of
*     unused file space is required, then the related application
*     NDFCOPY should be used.  This will copy the selected region of an
*     NDF to a new data structure from which any unused space will be
*     eliminated.
