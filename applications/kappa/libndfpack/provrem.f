      SUBROUTINE PROVREM( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PROVREM

*  Purpose:
*     Removes selected provenance information from an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PROVREM( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application removes selected ancestors, either by hiding them,
*     or deleting them from the provenance information stored in a given NDF.
*     The `generation gap' caused by removing an ancestor is bridged by 
*     assigning all the direct parents of the removed ancestor to each of 
*     the direct children of the ancestor.
*
*     The ancestors to be removed can be specified either by giving 
*     their indices (parameter ANCESTOR), or by comparing each ancestor 
*     with a supplied pattern matching template (parameter PATTERN).
*
*     If an ancestor is hidden rather than deleted (see parameter HIDE),
*     the ancestor is retained within the NDF, but a flag is set telling
*     later applications to ignore the ancestor (exactly how the flag is
*     used will depend on the particular application).

*  Usage:
*     provrem ndf pattern item

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ANCESTOR = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the indices of one or more ancestors that are to be
*        removed.  If a null (!) value is supplied, the ancestors to be
*        removed are instead determined using the PATTERN parameter. 
*        Each supplied index must be positive and refers to one of the 
*        NDFs listed in the ANCESTORS table in the PROVENANCE extension
*        of the NDF (including any hidden ancestors).  Note, if ancestor 
*        indices are determined using the PROVSHOW command, then PROVSHOW
*        should be run with the HIDE parameter set to FALSE - otherwise
*        incorrect ancestor indices may be determined, resulting in the
*        wrong ancestors being removed by PROVREM.
*
*        The maximum number of ancestors that can be removed is limited 
*        to 100 unless "ALL", "*" or "!" is specified.  The supplied 
*        parameter value can take any of the following forms.
*
*        - "ALL" or "*" --  All ancestors.
*
*        - "xx,yy,zz" -- A list of ancestor indices.
*
*        - "xx:yy" --  Ancestor indices between xx and yy inclusively. 
*        When xx is omitted, the range begins from 0; when yy is 
*        omitted, the range ends with the maximum value it can take, 
*        that is the number of ancestors described in the PROVENANCE 
*        extension.
*
*        - Any reasonable combination of above values separated by 
*        commas.  [!]
*     HIDE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then the ancestors are not deleted, but instead have a 
*        flag set indicating that they have been hidden. All information 
*        about hidden ancestors is retained unchanged, and can be viewed
*        using PROVSHOW if the HIDE parameter is set FALSE when running
*        PROVSHOW. [FALSE]
*     ITEM = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the item of provenance information that is checked 
*        against the pattern matching template specified for parameter 
*        PATTERN.  It can be "PATH", "CREATOR" or "DATE".  ["PATH"]
*     NDF = NDF (Update)
*        The NDF data structure.
*     PATTERN = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies a pattern matching template using the syntax 
*        described below in "Pattern Matching Syntax".  Each ancestor 
*        listed in the PROVENANCE extension of the NDF is compared with 
*        this template, and each ancestor that matches is removed.  The 
*        item of provenance information to be compared to the pattern is
*        specified by parameter ITEM. 
*     REMOVE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then the ancestors specified by parameter PATTERN or
*        ANCESTORS are removed.  Otherwise, these ancestors are retained
*        and all other ancestors are removed.  [TRUE]

*  Examples:
*     provrem ff ancestor=1
*        This removes the first ancestor from the NDF called ff.
*     provrem ff ancestor=all
*        This erases all provenance information.
*     provrem ff pattern='_xb$|_yb$' hide=yes
*        This hides, but does not permanently delete, all ancestors that 
*        have paths that end with "_xb" or "_yb".  Note, provenance paths 
*        do not include a trailing ".sdf" string.
*     provrem ff pattern='_ave'
*        This removes all ancestors that have paths that contain the
*        string "_ave" anywhere.
*     provrem ff pattern='_ave' remove=no
*        This removes all ancestors that have paths that do not contain 
*        the string "_ave" anywhere.
*     provrem ff pattern='_d[^/]*$'
*        This removes all ancestors that have file base-names that begin
*        with "_d" . The pattern matches "_d" followed by any number of
*        characters that are not "/", followed by the end of the string.
*     provrem ff pattern='^m51|^m31'
*        This removes all ancestors that have paths that begin with 
*        "m51" or "m31".

*  Pattern Matching Syntax:
*     The syntax for the PATTERN parameter value is a minimal form of 
*     regular expression. The following atoms are allowed.
*
*     "[chars]" -- Matches any of the characters within the brackets.
*     "[^chars]" -- Matches any character that is not within the
*                   brackets (ignoring the initial "^" character).
*     "." -- Matches any single character.
*     "\d" -- Matches a single digit.
*     "\D" -- Matches anything but a single digit.
*     "\w" -- Matches any alphanumeric character, and "_".
*     "\W" -- Matches anything but alphanumeric characters, and "_".
*     "\s" -- Matches white space.
*     "\S" -- Matches anything but white space.
*
*     Any other character that has no special significance within a
*     regular expression matches itself.  Characters that have special
*     significance can be matched by preceeding them with a backslash
*     (\) in which case their special significance is ignored (note, 
*     this does not apply to the characters in the set dDsSwW).
*
*     Note, minus signs ("-") within brackets have no special 
*     significance, so ranges of characters must be specified 
*     explicitly.
*
*     The following quantifiers are allowed.
*
*     "*" -- Matches zero or more of the preceeding atom, choosing the
*            largest possible number that gives a match.
*     "*?"-- Matches zero or more of the preceeding atom, choosing the
*           smallest possible number that gives a match.
*     "+" -- Matches one or more of the preceeding atom, choosing the
*            largest possible number that gives a match.
*     "+?"-- Matches one or more of the preceeding atom, choosing the
*            smallest possible number that gives a match.
*     "?" -- Matches zero or one of the preceeding atom.
*     "{n}" -- Matches exactly "n" occurrences of the preceeding atom.
*
*     The following constraints are allowed.
*
*     "^" -- Matches the start of the test string.
*     "$" -- Matches the end of the test string.
* 
*     Multiple templates can be concatenated, using the "|" character to
*     separate them.  The test string is compared against each one in 
*     turn until a match is found.
