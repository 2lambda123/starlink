      SUBROUTINE NDFECHO( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDFECHO

*  Purpose:
*     Displays a group of NDF names.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDFECHO( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application lists the names of the supplied NDFs to the
*     screen, optionally filtering them using a regular expression. Its
*     primary use is within scripts that need to process groups of NDFs.
*     Instead of the full name, a required component of the name may be
*     displayed instead (see parameter SHOW).
*
*     Two modes are available:
*
*     - If the NDFs are specified via the "NDF" parameter, then the NDFs
*     must exist and be accessible (an error is reported otherwise). The
*     NDF names obtained can then be modified by supplying a suitable GRP
*     modification expression such as "*_A" for parameter "MOD"
*
*     - To list NDFs that may not exist, supply a null (!) value for
*     parameter "NDF" and the main group expression to parameter "MOD".

*  Usage:
*     ndfecho ndf [mod] [first] [last] [show]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ABSPATH = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, any relative NDF paths are converted to absolute, using
*        the current working directory. [FALSE]
*     FIRST = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The index of the first NDF to be tested. A null (!) value
*        causes the first NDF to be used (Index 1). [!]
*     LAST = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The index of the last NDF to be tested. If a non-null value is
*        supplied for FIRST, then the run-time default for LAST is equal
*        to the supplied FIRST value (so that only a single NDF will be
*        tested). If a null value is supplied for FIRST, then the
*        run-time default for LAST is the last NDF in the supplied group. []
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Write)
*        The name of a text file in which to store the listed NDF names.
*        If a null (!) value is supplied, no log file is created. [!]
*     MOD = LITERAL (Read)
*        An optional GRP modification expression that will be used to
*        modify any names obtained via the "NDF" parameter. For instance,
*        if "MOD" is "*_A" then the supplied NDF names will be modified
*        by appending "_A" to them. No modification occurs if a null (!)
*        value is supplied.
*
*        If a null value is supplied for "NDF" then the value supplied
*        for "MOD" should not include an asterisk, since there are no
*        names to be modified. Instead, the "MOD" value should specify an
*        explicit group of NDF names that do not need to exist. [!]
*     NDF = NDF (Read)
*        A group of existing NDFs, or null (!).  This should be given as
*        a comma-separated list, in which each list element can be one
*        of the following options:
*
*        - An NDF name, optionally containing wild-cards and/or regular
*        expressions ("*", "?", "[a-z]" etc.).
*
*        - The name of a text file, preceded by an up-arrow character
*        "^".  Each line in the text file should contain a
*        comma-separated list of elements, each of which can in turn be
*        an NDF name (with optional wild-cards, etc.), or another file
*        specification (preceded by an up-arrow).  Comments can be
*        included in the file by commencing lines with a hash character
*        "#".
*
*        If the value supplied for this parameter ends with a hyphen,
*        then you are re-prompted for further input until a value is
*        given which does not end with a hyphen.  All the NDFs given in
*        this way are concatenated into a single group.
*
*        If a null (!) value is supplied, then the displayed list of NDFs
*        is determined by the value supplied for the "MOD" parameter.
*     NMATCH = _INTEGER (Write)
*        An output parameter to which is written the number of NDFs
*        between FIRST and LAST that match the pattern supplied by PATTERN.
*     PATTERN = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies a pattern matching template using the syntax described
*        below in "Pattern Matching Syntax".  Each NDF is displayed only
*        if a match is found between this pattern and the item specified
*        by parameter SHOW.   A null (!) value causes all NDFs to be
*        displayed. [!]
*     SHOW = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the information to be displayed about each NDF. The
*        options are as follows.
*
*        - "Base" -- The base file name.
*
*        - "Dir" -- The directory path (if any).
*
*        - "Ftype" -- The file type (usually ".sdf" but may not be if
*        any foreign NDFs are supplied).
*
*        - "Fspec" -- The directory, base name and file type concatenated
*        to form a full file specification.
*
*        - "HDSpath" -- The HDS path within the container file (if any).
*
*        - "Path" -- The full name of the NDF as supplied by the user.
*
*        - "Slice" -- The NDF slice specification (if any).
*
*        Items that do not match the pattern specified by parameter
*        PATTERN are not displayed. ["Path"]
*     SIZE = _INTEGER (Write)
*        An output parameter to which is written the total number of
*        NDFs in the specified group.
*     VALUE = LITERAL (Write)
*        An output parameter to which is written information about the
*        first NDF that matches the pattern specified by parameter PATTERN.
*        The information to write is specified by the SHOW parameter.

*  Examples:
*     ndfecho mycont
*        Report the full path of all the NDFs within the HDS container
*        file "mycont.sdf". The NDFs must all exist.
*     ndfecho ^files.lis first=4 show=base
*        This reports the file base name for just the fourth NDF in the
*        list specified within the text file "files.lis". The NDFs must
*        all exist.
*     ndfecho ^files.lis *_a logfile=log.lis
*        This reports the names of the NDFs listed in text file files.lis,
*        but appending "_a" to the end of each name. The NDFs must all exist.
*        The listed NDF names are written to a new text file called "log.lis".
*     ndfecho in=! mod={^base}|_a|_b|
*        This reports the names of the NDFs listed in text file "base", but
*        replacing "_a" with "_b" in their names. The NDFs need not exist
*        since they are completely specified by parameter "MOD" and not by
*        parameter "NDF".

*  Pattern Matching Syntax:
*     The syntax for the PATTERN parameter value is a minimal form of
*     regular expression. The following atoms are allowed.
*
*     "[chars]" -- Matches any of the characters within the brackets.
*     "[^chars]" -- Matches any character that is not within the
*                   brackets (ignoring the initial "^" character).
*     "." -- Matches any single character.
*     "\d" -- Matches a single digit.
*     "\D" -- Matches anything but a single digit.
*     "\w" -- Matches any alphanumeric character, and "_".
*     "\W" -- Matches anything but alphanumeric characters, and "_".
*     "\s" -- Matches white space.
*     "\S" -- Matches anything but white space.
*
*     Any other character that has no special significance within a
*     regular expression matches itself.  Characters that have special
*     significance can be matched by preceeding them with a backslash
*     (\) in which case their special significance is ignored (note,
*     this does not apply to the characters in the set dDsSwW).
*
*     Note, minus signs ("-") within brackets have no special
*     significance, so ranges of characters must be specified
*     explicitly.
*
*     The following quantifiers are allowed.
*
*     "*" -- Matches zero or more of the preceeding atom, choosing the
*            largest possible number that gives a match.
*     "*?"-- Matches zero or more of the preceeding atom, choosing the
*           smallest possible number that gives a match.
*     "+" -- Matches one or more of the preceeding atom, choosing the
*            largest possible number that gives a match.
*     "+?"-- Matches one or more of the preceeding atom, choosing the
*            smallest possible number that gives a match.
*     "?" -- Matches zero or one of the preceeding atom.
*     "{n}" -- Matches exactly "n" occurrences of the preceeding atom.
*
*     The following constraints are allowed.
*
*     "^" -- Matches the start of the test string.
*     "$" -- Matches the end of the test string.
*
*     Multiple templates can be concatenated, using the "|" character to
*     separate them.  The test string is compared against each one in
*     turn until a match is found.
