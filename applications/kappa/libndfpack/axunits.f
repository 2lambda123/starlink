      SUBROUTINE AXUNITS( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     AXUNITS

*  Purpose:
*     Sets a new units value for an axis within an NDF data structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL AXUNITS( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine sets a new value for a UNITS component of an
*     existing NDF AXIS data structure.  The NDF is accessed in update
*     mode and any pre-existing UNITS component is over-written with a
*     new value.  Alternatively, if a `null' value (!) is given for the
*     UNITS parameter, then the NDF's axis UNITS component will be
*     erased.  If an AXIS structure does not exist, a new one whose
*     centres are pixel co-ordinates is created.

*  Usage:
*     axunits ndf units dim 

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DIM = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The axis dimension for which the units is to be modified.
*        There are separate units for each NDF dimension.  The value
*        must lie between 1 and the number of dimensions of the NDF.
*        This defaults to 1 for a 1-dimensional NDF.  The suggested
*        default is the current value. []
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The NDF data structure in which an axis UNITS component is to
*        be modified.
*     UNITS = LITERAL (Read)
*        The value to be assigned to the NDF's axis UNITS component
*        (e.g. "Pixels" or "km/s").  UNITS describes the physical units
*        of the quantity measured along the axis.  This value may later
*        be used by other applications for labelling graphs and other
*        forms of display where the NDF's axis co-ordinates are shown.
*        The suggested default is the current value.

*  Examples:
*     axunits ngc253 "arcsec" 2
*        Sets the UNITS component of the second axis dimension of the
*        NDF structure ngc253 to have the value "arcsec".
*     axunits ndf=spect units=Angstrom
*        Sets the axis UNITS component of the 1-dimensional NDF
*        structure spect to have the value "Angstrom".
*     axunits datafile units=! dim=3
*        By specifying a null value (!), this example erases any
*        previous value of the UNITS component for the third dimension
*        in the NDF structure datafile.
