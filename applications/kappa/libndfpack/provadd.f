      SUBROUTINE PROVADD( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PROVADD

*  Purpose:
*     Stores provenance information in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PROVADD( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application modifies the provenance information stored in an
*     NDF. It records a second specified NDF as a direct parent of the 
*     first NDF. If an NDF has more than one direct parent then this
*     application should be run multiple times, once for each parent.

*  Usage:
*     provadd ndf parent creator isroot moretext

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     CREATOR = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text identifier for the software that created the main NDF
*        (usually the name of the calling application).  The format of 
*        the identifier is arbitrary, but the form "PACKAGE:COMMAND" is
*        recommended.  If a null (!) value is supplied, no creator
*        information is stored.  [!]
*     ISROOT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then the NDF given by parameter "PARENT" will be 
*        treated as a root NDF.  That is, any provenance information 
*        within PARENT describing its own parents is ignored.  If FALSE,
*        then any provenance information within PARENT is copied into
*        the main NDF.  PARENT is then only a root NDF only if it 
*        contains no provenance information.  [FALSE]
*     MORE = UNIV (Read)
*        This is only accessed if a null value is supplied for parameter
*        MORETEXT.  If supplied, it should be an HDS object containing
*        arbitrary additional information about the parent NDF, and how 
*        it was used in the creation of the main NDF.  This information 
*        is stored with the provenance in the main NDF.  If a null (!) 
*        value is supplied no additional information is stored.  [!]
*     MORETEXT = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of "keyword=value" strings that give additional 
*        information about the parent NDF, and how it was used in the 
*        creation of the main NDF.  If supplied, this information is 
*        stored with the provenance in the main NDF.  If a null (!) 
*        value is supplied, then the MORE parameter will be used to 
*        obtain this extra information instead of MORETEXT. 
*
*        The supplied value should be either a comma-separated list of
*        strings, or the name of a text file preceded by an up-arrow 
*        character "^", containing one or more comma-separated list of 
*        strings.  Each string is either a "keyword=value" setting, or 
*        the name of a text file preceded by an up-arrow character "^". 
*        Such text files should contain further comma-separated lists 
*        which will be read and interpreted in the same manner (any 
*        blank lines or lines beginning with "#" are ignored).  Within a
*        text file, newlines can be used as delimiters as well as 
*        commas.
*
*        Each individual setting should be of the form:
*
*           <keyword>=<value>
*
*        where <keyword> is either a simple name, or a dot-delimited
*        hierarchy of names (e.g. "camera.settings.exp=1.0").  The 
*        <value> string should not contain any commas.  [!]
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The NDF which is to be modified.
*     PARENT = NDF (Read)
*        An NDF that is to be recorded as a direct parent of the NDF
*        given by parameter "NDF".

*  Examples:
*     provadd m51_ff ff
*        Records the fact that NDF "ff" was used in the creation of NDF
*        "m51_ff".

*  Notes:
*     Provenance information is stored in an NDF extension called
*     PROVENANCE, and is propagated automatically by all KAPPA
*     applications.

*     KAPPA: PROVMOD, PROVSHOW, HISCOM.
