      SUBROUTINE SETNORM( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SETNORM

*  Purpose:
*     Sets a new value for one or all of an NDF's axis-normalisation
*     flags.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SETNORM( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine sets a new value for one or all the normalisation
*     flags in an NDF AXIS data structure.  The NDF is accessed in
*     update mode.  This flag determines how the NDF's data and
*     variance arrays behave when the associated axis information is
*     modified.
*
*     If an AXIS structure does not exist, a new one whose centres are
*     pixel co-ordinates is created.

*  Usage:
*     setnorm ndf dim 

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ANORM = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        The normalisation flag for the axis.  TRUE means that the
*        data and variance values in the NDF are normalised to the
*        pixel width values for the chosen axis so that the product
*        of data value and width, and variance and the squared width
*        are constant if the width is altered.
*
*        A FALSE value means that the data and variance need not alter
*        as the pixel widths are varied.  This is the default for an
*        axis.  The suggested default is the current value.
*     DIM = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The axis dimension for which the normalisation flag is to be
*        modified.  There are separate units for each NDF dimension.
*        A value of 0 sets the normalisation flag for all the axes.
*        The value must lie between 0 and the number of dimensions of
*        the NDF.  This defaults to 1 for a 1-dimensional NDF.  The
*        suggested default is the current value. []
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The NDF data structure in which an axis-normalisation flag
*        is to be modified.

*  Examples:
*     setnorm hd23568 0 anorm
*        This sets the normalisation flags along all axes of the
*        NDF structure hd23568 to be true.
*     setnorm ndf=spect noanorm
*        This sets the normalisation flag of the 1-dimensional NDF
*        structure spect to be false.
*     setnorm borg 3 anorm
*        This sets the normalisation flag for the third dimension
*        in the NDF structure borg.

*  Axis Normalisation:
*     In general, the axis-normalisation property is not needed.  An
*     example where it is relevant is a spectrum in which data values
*     representing energy per unit wavelength and each pixel has a
*     known spread in wavelength.  The sum of each pixel's data value
*     multiplied by its width gives the energy in a part of the
*     spectrum.  A change to the axis width, say to allow for the
*     redshift, necessitates a corresponding modification to the data
*     value to retain this property.  In two dimensions an example is
*     where the data measure flux per unit area of sky and the pixel
*     widths are defined in terms of angular size.
