      SUBROUTINE FITSIMP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FITSIMP

*  Purpose:
*     Imports FITS information into an NDF extension.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FITSIMP( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application extracts the values of FITS keywords from a FITS
*     extension in an NDF and uses them to construct another NDF
*     extension.  The list of new extension components required, their
*     data types and the names of the FITS keywords from which to
*     derive their values are specified in a "keyword translation
*     table" held in a separate text file.

*  Usage:
*     fitsimp ndf table xname xtype

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The NDF in which the new extension is to be created.
*     TABLE = FILENAME (Read)
*        The text file containing the keyword translation table.  The
*        format of this file is described under "Table Format".
*     XNAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the NDF extension which is to receive the values
*        read from the FITS extension.  If this extension does not
*        already exist, then it will be created.  Otherwise, it should
*        be a scalar structure extension within which new components
*        may be created (existing components of the same name will be
*        over-written).  Extension names may contain up to 15
*        alpha-numeric characters, beginning with an alphabetic
*        character.
*     XTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The HDS data type of the output extension.  This value will
*        only be required if the extension does not initially exist and
*        must be created.  New extensions will be created as scalar
*        structures.

*  Examples:
*     fitsimp datafile fitstable ccdinfo ccd_ext
*        Creates a new extension called CCDINFO (with a data type of
*        CCD_EXT) in the NDF structure called datafile.  Keyword values
*        are read from the NDF's FITS extension and written into the new
*        extension as separate components under control of a keyword
*        translation table held in the file fitstable.
*     fitsimp ndf=n1429 table=std_table xname=std_extn
*        FITS keyword values are read from the FITS extension in the
*        NDF structure n1429 and written into the pre-existing
*        extension STD_EXTN under control of the translation table
*        std_table.  Components which already exist within the
*        extension may be over-written by this process.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: FITSHEAD, FITSLIST, FITSDIN, FITSIN; CONVERT: FITS2NDF;
*     Figaro: RDFITS.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     -  The imaginary part of complex FITS keyword values will be lost.
*     -  When the data type is _CHAR, the value associated with the
*     FITS keyword in the `card image' must be enclosed in quotes.

*  Table Format:
*     The keyword translation table should be held in a text file, with
*     one extension component specified per line.  Each line should
*     contain 3 fields, separated by spaces and/or tabs, as follows.
*
*     -  Field 1:
*        The name of the component in the output extension for which a
*        value is to be obtained.
*
*     -  Field 2:
*        The data type of the output component, to which the keyword
*        value will be converted (one of _INTEGER, _REAL, _DOUBLE,
*        _LOGICAL or _CHAR).
*
*     -  Field 3:
*        The name of the FITS keyword from which the value is to be
*        obtained.  Hierarchical keywords are permissible; the format
*        is concatenated keywords joined with full stops and no spaces,
*        e.g. HIERARCH.ESO.NTT.HUMIDITY, ING.DETHEAD.
*
*     Comments may appear at any point in the table and should begin
*     with an exclamation mark. The remainder of the line will then be
*     ignored.

*  Timing:
*     Approximately proportional to the number of FITS keywords to be
*     translated.
