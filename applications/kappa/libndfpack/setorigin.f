      SUBROUTINE SETORIGIN( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SETORIGIN

*  Purpose:
*     Sets a new pixel origin for an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SETORIGIN( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This application sets a new pixel origin value for an NDF data
*     structure.  The NDF is accessed in update mode and the indices of
*     the first pixel (the NDF's lower pixel-index bounds) are set to
*     specified integer values, which may be positive or negative.  No
*     other properties of the NDF are altered.  If required, a template
*     NDF may be supplied and the new origin values will be derived
*     from it.

*  Usage:
*     setorigin ndf origin

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     LIKE = NDF (Read)
*        This parameter may be used to supply an NDF which is to be
*        used as a template.  If such a template is supplied, then its
*        origin (its lower pixel-index bounds) will be used as the new
*        origin value for the NDF supplied via the NDF parameter.  By
*        default, no template will be used and the new origin will be
*        specified via the ORIGIN parameter. [!]
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The NDF data structure whose pixel origin is to be modified.
*     ORIGIN() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        A 1-dimensional array specifying the new pixel origin values,
*        one for each NDF dimension.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     If the number of new pixel origin values is less than the number
*     of NDF dimensions, then the pixel origin of the extra dimensions
*     will remain unchanged.  If the number of values exceeds the number
*     of NDF dimensions, then the excess values will be ignored.

*  Examples:
*     setorigin image_2d [1,1]
*        Sets the indices of the first pixel in the 2-dimensional image
*        image_2d to be (1,1).  The image pixel values are unaltered.
*     setorigin ndf=starfield
*        A new pixel origin is set for the NDF structure called
*        starfield.  SETORIGIN will prompt for the new origin values,
*        supplying the existing values as defaults.
*     setorigin ndf=cube origin=[-128,-128]
*        Sets the pixel origin values for the first two dimensions of
*        the 3-dimensional NDF called cube to be (-128,-128).  A value
*        for the third dimension is not specified, so the origin of
*        this dimension will remain unchanged.
*     setorigin betapic like=alphapic
*        Sets the pixel origin of the NDF called betapic to be equal to
*        that of the NDF called alphapic.

*  Timing:
*     Setting a new pixel origin is a quick operation whose timing does
*     not depend on the size of the NDF.
