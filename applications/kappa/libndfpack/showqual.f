      SUBROUTINE SHOWQUAL( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SHOWQUAL

*  Purpose:
*     Displays the quality names defined in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SHOWQUAL( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine displays a list of all the quality names currently
*     defined within a supplied NDF (see Task SETQUAL). The descriptive
*     comments which were stored with the quality names when they were
*     originally defined are also displayed. An option exists for also
*     displaying the number of pixels which hold each quality.

*  Usage:
*     showqual in [count]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     COUNT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If true, then the number of pixels in each NDF which holds
*        each defined quality is displayed. These figures are shown
*        in parentheses between the quality name and associated
*        comment.  This option adds significantly to the run time.  [NO]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF.
*     QNAMES( ) = LITERAL (Write)
*        The quality names associated with each bit, starting from the
*        lowest significant bit.  Unassigned bits have blank strings.

*  Examples:
*     showqual "m51,cena" yes
*        This example displays all the quality names currently defined
*        for the two NDFs "m51" and "cena" together with the number of
*        pixels holding each quality.
