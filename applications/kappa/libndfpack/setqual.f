      SUBROUTINE SETQUAL( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SETQUAL

*  Purpose:
*     Assign a specified quality to selected pixels within an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SETQUAL( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine assigns (or optionally removes) the quality
*     specified by parameter QNAME to (or from) selected pixels in an
*     NDF.  For more information about using quality within KAPPA see 
*     the appendix "Using Quality Names" within SUN/95.
*
*     The user can select the pixels to be operated on in one of three
*     ways (see parameter SELECT).
*
*     - By giving a `mask' NDF.  Pixels with bad values in the mask NDF 
*     will be selected from the corresponding input NDF.
*
*     - By giving a list of pixel indices for the pixels which are to
*     be selected.
*
*     - By giving an ARD file containing a description of the regions of
*     the NDF which are to be selected.  The ARD system (see SUN/183) 
*     uses a textual language to describe geometric regions of an array.
*     Text files containing ARD description suitable for use with this
*     routine can be created interactively using the routine ARDGEN.
*
*     The operation to be performed on the pixels is specified by
*     parameter FUNCTION.  The given quality may be assigned to or
*     removed from pixels within the NDF.  The pixels operated on
*     can either be those selected by the user (as described above),
*     or those not selected.  The quality of all other pixels is left
*     unchanged (unless the parameter FUNCTION is given the value NS+HU
*     or NU+HS).  Thus for instance if pixel (1,1) already held the
*     quality specified by QNAME, and the quality was then assigned to
*     pixel (2,2) this would not cause the quality to be removed from
*     pixel (1,1).

*  Usage:
*     setqual ndf qname comment mask 

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ARDFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        The name of the ARD file containing a description of the parts
*        of the NDF to be `selected'.  The ARD parameter is only 
*        prompted for if the SELECT parameter is given the value "ARD".
*        The co-ordinate system in which positions within this file are 
*        given should be indicated by including suitable COFRAME or WCS 
*        statements within the file (see SUN/183), but will default to 
*        pixel co-ordinates in the absence of any such statements.  For 
*        instance, starting the file with a line containing the text 
*        "COFRAME(SKY,System=FK5)" would indicate that positions are 
*        specified in RA/DEC (FK5,J2000).  The statement 
*        "COFRAME(PIXEL)" indicates explicitly that positions are 
*        specified in pixel co-ordinates. 
*     COMMENT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A comment to store with the quality name.  This parameter is
*        only prompted for if the NDF does not already contain a
*        definition of the quality name.  
*     FUNCTION = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter specifies what function is to be performed on
*        the "selected" pixels specified using parameters MASK, LIST or
*        ARD.  It can take any of the following values. 
*
*        - "HS" -- Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is held by
*                  all the selected pixels. The quality of all other
*                  pixels is left unchanged.
*
*        - "HU" -- Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is held by
*                 all the pixels that have not been selected.  The 
*                 quality of the selected pixels is left unchanged.
*
*        - "NS" -- Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is not 
*                 held by any of the selected pixels.  The quality of 
*                 all other pixels is left unchanged.
*
*        - "NU" -- Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is not 
*                  held by any of the pixels that have not been 
*                  selected.  The quality of the selected pixels is left
*                  unchanged.
*
*        - "HS+NU" -- Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is held
*                  by all the selected pixels and not held by any of 
*                  the other pixels.
*
*        - "HU+NS" -- Ensure that the quality specified by QNAME is 
*                  held by all the pixels that have not been selected 
*                  and not held by any of the selected pixels.
*        ["HS"]
*     LIST = LITERAL (Read)
*        A group of pixels positions within the input NDF listing the
*        pixels that are to be `selected' (see parameter FUNCTION).
*        Each position should be giving as a list of pixel indices 
*        (eg X1, Y1, X2, Y2,...  for a two dimensional NDF). LIST is 
*        only prompted for if parameter SELECT is given the value LIST.
*     MASK = NDF (Read)
*        A mask NDF used to define the `selected' pixels within the 
*        input NDF (see parameter FUNCTION).  The mask should be aligned
*        pixel-for-pixel with the input NDF.  Pixels that are bad in
*        the mask NDF are `selected'. The quality of any pixels that
*        lie outside the bounds of the mask NDF are left unaltered.
*        This parameter is only prompted for if the parameter SELECT is
*        given the value MASK.
*     NDF = NDF (Update)
*        The NDF in which the quality information is to be stored. 
*     QNAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        The quality name. If the supplied name is not already defined
*        within the input NDF, then a definition of the name is
*        added to the NDF. The user is warned if the quality name is
*        already defined within the NDF.
*     READONLY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then an error will be reported if any attempt is
*        subsequently made to remove the quality name (e.g. using
*        REMQUAL). [FALSE]
*     SELECT = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter determines how the pixels are selected, and can
*        take the values "Mask", "List" or "ARD" (see parameters MASK, 
*        LIST, and ARD). ["Mask"]
*     XNAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        If an NDF already contains any quality name definitions then
*        new quality names are put in the same extension as the old
*        names.  If no previous quality names have been stored in the
*        NDF then parameter XNAME will be used to obtain the name of an
*        NDF extension in which to store the new quality name.  The
*        extension will be created if it does not already exist (see
*        parameter XTYPE). [QUALITY_NAMES]
*     XTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        If a new NDF extension is created to hold quality names (see
*        parameter XNAME), then parameter XTYPE is used to obtain the
*        HDS data type for the created extension. The run time default
*        is to give the extension a type identical to its name.  []

*  Examples:
*     setqual m51 saturated "Saturated pixels" m51_cut
*        This example ensures that the quality "SATURATED" is defined
*        within the NDF "M51". The comment "Saturated pixels" is stored
*        with the quality name if it did not already exist in the NDF.
*        The quality SATURATED is then assigned to all pixels for which
*        the corresponding pixel in NDF M51_CUT is bad. The quality of
*        all other pixels is left unchanged.
*     setqual "m51,cena" source_a select=list list=^source_a.lis function=hs+nu
*        This example ensures that pixels within the two NDFs m51 and
*        cena which are included in the list of pixel indices held in
*        text file source_a.lis, have the quality "SOURCE_A", and also
*        ensures that none of the pixels which were not included in
*        source_a.lis have the quality.
*     setqual m51 source_b select=ard ard=background.ard
*        This example assigns the quality "source_b" to pixels of the
*        NDF "m51" as described by an ARD description stored in the text
*        file "background.ard". This text file could for instance have
*        been created using routine ARDGEN.

*  Notes:
*     -  All the quality names which are currently defined within an
*     NDF can be listed by application SHOWQUAL.  Quality name
*     definitions can be removed from an NDF using application REMQUAL.
*     If there is no room for any more quality names to be added to the
*     NDF then REMQUAL can be used to remove a quality name in order to
*     make room for the new quality names.
