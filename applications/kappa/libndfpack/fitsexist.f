      SUBROUTINE FITSEXIST( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FITSEXIST

*  Purpose:
*     Inquires whether or not a keyword exists in a FITS extension.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FITSMOD( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application reports whether or not a keyword exists in an
*     the FITS extension of an NDF file.

*  Usage:
*     fitsexist ndf keyword

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     EXISTS = _LOGICAL (Write)
*        The result of the last existence test.
*     KEYWORD = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the keyword to be edited in the FITS extension.  A
*        name may be compound to handle hierarchical keywords, and it
*        has the form keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  The maximum
*        number of keywords per FITS card is 20.  Each keyword must be
*        no longer than 8 characters, and be a valid FITS keyword
*        comprising only alphanumeric characters, hyphen, and
*        underscore.  Any lowercase letters are converted to uppercase
*        and blanks are removed before insertion, or comparison with the
*        existing keywords.
*
*        KEYWORD may have an occurrence specified in brackets [] 
*        following  the name.  This enables editing of a keyword that is 
*        not the first occurrence of that keyword, or locate a edited
*        keyword not at the first occurrence of the positional keyword.
*        Note that it is not normal to have multiple occurrences of a
*        keyword in a FITS header, unless it is blank, COMMENT or 
*        HISTORY.  Any text between the brackets other than a positive
*        integer is interpreted as the first occurrence.
*     NDF = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF to be tested for the presence of the FITS keyword.

*  Examples:
*     fitsexist abc bscale
*        This reports TRUE or FALSE depending on whether or not the
*        FITS keyword BSCALE exists in the FITS extension of the NDF
*        called abc.
*     fitsexist ndf=abc keyword=date[2]
*        This reports TRUE or FALSE depending on whether or not the
*        FITS there are at least two occurrences of the keyword DATE.

*     KAPPA: FITSEDIT, FITSHEAD, FITSLIST, FITSVAL.
