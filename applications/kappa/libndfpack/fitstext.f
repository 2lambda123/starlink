      SUBROUTINE FITSTEXT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FITSTEXT

*  Purpose:
*     Creates an NDF FITS extension from a text file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FITSTEXT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application takes a version of a FITS header stored in a
*     text file, and inserts it into the FITS extension of an NDF.  The
*     header is not copied verbatim as some validation of the headers
*     as legal FITS occurs.  An existing FITS extension is removed.

*  Usage:
*     fitstext ndf file

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     NDF = NDF (Read and Write)
*        The name of the NDF to store the FITS header information.
*     FILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        The text file containing the FITS headers.  Each record should
*        be the standard 80-character `card image'.  If the file has
*        been edited care is needed to ensure that none of the cards
*        are wrapped onto a second line.

*  Examples:
*     fitstext hh73 headers.lis
*        This places the FITS headers stored in the text file called
*        headers.lis in the FITS extension of the NDF called hh73.

*  Notes:
*     - The validation process performs the following checks on each
*     header `card':
*       a) the length of the header is no more than 80 characters,
*       otherwise it is truncated;
*       b) the keyword only contains uppercase Latin alphabetic
*       characters, numbers, underscore, and hyphen (the header will
*       not be copied to the extension except when the invalid
*       characters are lowercase letters);
*       c) value cards have an equals sign in column 9 and a space in
*       column 10;
*       d) quotes enclose character values;
*       e) single quotes inside string values are doubled;
*       f) character values are left justified to column 11 (retaining
*       leading blanks) and contain at least 8 characters (padding with
*       spaces if necessary);
*       g) non-character values are right justified to column 30, except
*       for non-mandatory keywords which have a double-precision value
*       requiring more than 20 digits;
*       h) the comment delimiter is in column 32 or two characters
*       following the value, whichever is greater;
*       i) an equals sign in column 9 of a commentary card is replaced
*       by a space; and
*       j) comments begin at least two columns after the end of the
*       comment delimiter.
*
*     - The validation issues warning messages at the normal reporting
*     level for violations a), b), c), d), and i).
*
*     -  The validation can only go so far.  If any of your header lines
*     are ambiguous, the resulting entry in the FITS extension may not
*     be what you intended.  Therefore, you should inspect the
*     resulting FITS extension using the command FITSLIST before
*     exporting the data.  If there is something wrong, you may find it
*     convenient to use command FITSEDIT to make minor corrections.
