      SUBROUTINE FITSLIST( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FITSLIST

*  Purpose:
*     Lists the FITS extension of an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FITSLIST( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application lists the FITS header stored in an NDF FITS
*     extension.  The list may either be reported directly to you,
*     or written to a text file. The displayed list of headers can
*     be augmented, if required, by the inclusion of FITS headers 
*     representing the current World Coordinate System defined by the 
*     WCS component in the NDF (see parameter ENCODING).

*  Usage:
*     fitslist in [logfile]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ENCODING = LITERAL (Read)
*        If a non-null value is supplied, the NDF WCS component is used
*        to generate a set of FITS headers describing the WCS, and these 
*        headers are added into the displayed list of headers (any WCS
*        headers inherited from the FITS extension are first removed). The 
*        value supplied for ENCODING controls the FITS keywords which will 
*        be used to represent the WCS. The value supplied should be one of 
*        the encodings listed in the "World Co-ordinate Systems" section 
*        below.  An error is reported if the WCS cannot be represented using 
*        the supplied encoding. A trailing minus sign can be appended to the 
*        end of the encoding to indicate that only the WCS headers should be 
*        displayed (that is, the contents of the FITS extension are not 
*        displayed if the encoding ends with a minus sign). Also see the
*        FULLWCS parameter. [!]
*     FULLWCS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Only accessed if ENCODING is non-null. If TRUE, then all 
*        co-ordinate frames in the WCS component are written out.
*        Otherwise, only the current Frame is written out. [FALSE]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF whose FITS extension is to be listed.
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        The name of the text file to store a list of the FITS
*        extension.  If it is null (!) the list of the FITS extension
*        is reported directly to you. [!]

*  Examples:
*     fitslist saturn
*        The contents of the FITS extension in NDF saturn are
*        reported to you.
*     fitslist ngc205 logfile=ngcfits.lis
*        The contents of the FITS extension in NDF ngc205 are
*        written to the text file ngcfits.lis.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the NDF does not have a FITS extension the application will
*     exit unless the value supplied for ENCODING ends with a minus sign.

*  World Co-ordinate Systems:
*     The ENCODING parameter can take any of the following values:
*
*        "FITS-IRAF" --- This uses keywords CRVALi CRPIXi, CDi_j, and
*        the system commonly used by IRAF.  It is described in the
*        document "World Coordinate Systems Representations Within the
*        FITS Format" by R.J. Hanisch and D.G. Wells, 1988, available by
*        ftp from fits.cv.nrao.edu /fits/documents/wcs/wcs88.ps.Z. 
*
*        "FITS-WCS" --- This is the FITS standard WCS encoding
*        scheme described in the paper "Representation of celestial
*        coordinates in FITS"
*        (http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/).  It is
*        very similar to "FITS-IRAF" but supports a wider range of
*        projections and co-ordinate systems. 
*
*        "FITS-WCS(CD)" --- This is the same as "FITS-WCS" except that
*        the scaling and rotation of the data array is described by a 
*        CD matrix instead of a PC matrix with associated CDELT values.
*
*        "FITS-PC" --- This uses keywords CRVALi, CDELTi, CRPIXi, 
*        PCiiijjj, etc., as described in a previous (now superseded)
*        draft of the above FITS world co-ordinate system paper by
*        E.W.Greisen and M.Calabretta.
*
*        "FITS-AIPS" --- This uses conventions described in the document
*        "Non-linear Coordinate Systems in AIPS" by Eric W. Greisen
*        (revised 9th September, 1994), available by ftp from
*        fits.cv.nrao.edu /fits/documents/wcs/aips27.ps.Z.  It is
*        currently employed by the AIPS data-analysis facility (amongst
*        others), so its use will facilitate data exchange with AIPS. 
*        This encoding uses CROTAi and CDELTi keywords to describe axis
*        rotation and scaling.
*
*        "FITS-AIPS++" --- This is an extension to FITS-AIPS which 
*        allows the use of a wider range of celestial projections, as
*        used by the AIPS++ project.
*
*        "FITS-CLASS" --- This uses the conventions of the CLASS 
*        project.  CLASS is a software package for reducing single-dish
*        radio and sub-mm spectroscopic data.  It supports double 
*        sideband spectra.  See 
*        http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/html/class-html/class.html.
*
*        "DSS" --- This is the system used by the Digital Sky Survey,
*        and uses keywords AMDXn, AMDYn, PLTRAH, etc.
*
*        "NATIVE" --- This is the native system used by the AST library 
*        (see SUN/210) and provides a loss-free method for transferring
*        WCS information between AST-based application.  It allows more
*        complicated WCS information to be stored and retrieved than any
*        of the other encodings.
