      SUBROUTINE FITSLIST( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FITSLIST

*  Purpose:
*     Lists the FITS extension of an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FITSLIST( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application lists the FITS header stored in an NDF FITS
*     extension.  The list may either be reported directly to you,
*     or written to a text file.

*  Usage:
*     fitslist in [logfile]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF whose FITS extension is to be listed.
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        The name of the text file to store a list of the FITS
*        extension.  If it is null (!) the list of the FITS extension
*        is reported directly to you. [!]

*  Examples:
*     fitslist saturn
*        The contents of the FITS extension in NDF saturn are
*        reported to you.
*     fitslist ngc205 logfile=ngcfits.lis
*        The contents of the FITS extension in NDF ngc205 are
*        written to the text file ngcfits.lis.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the NDF does not have a FITS extension the application will
*     exit.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: FITSEDIT, FITSHEAD; Figaro: FITSKEYS.

*        Original version.
*     2004 September 3 (TIMJ):
*        Use CNF_PVAL.
*     2006 October 17 (TIMJ):
*        Enable STREAM mode when dumping FITS contents.  We do not want
*        to word wrap at 79 characters.
*     2006 October 24 (MJC):
*        Use modern commenting style.
