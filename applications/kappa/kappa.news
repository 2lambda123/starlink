1 KAPPA_Version_1.2

   A new release of KAPPA (v1.2) has been made. The main changes are:

   - Modified COLLAPSE so that output variances can be created for any
   size of input array when using the median estimator.

   - Bug in APERADD has been fixed which caused the value of the DIAM 
   parameter to be used as the radius of the aperture instead of the diameter.

   For complete details of all changes, see the "Release Notes" appendix in 
   SUN/95.
