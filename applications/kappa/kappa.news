1 KAPPA_Version_0.16

   A new release of KAPPA (V0.16) has been made. The changes are
   described fully in sun95.

   - A new command called LUTWARM has been added. It loads a colour 
   table which goes from black to white, passing through warm shades 
   of yellow and brown, as popularised by GAIA. 

   - A new command called PERMAXES has been added. It permutes the axes
   of an NDF. This rearranges the pixel values within the NDF and also
   rearranges the AXIS stuctures and WCS FrameSet so that they refer to
   the correct pixel axes.

   - THRESH may now be used to replace data between specified
   thresholds as well as outside specified thresholds, by setting 
   the lower threshold greater than the upper threshold.

   - A bug has been fixed in PSF which caused the output NDF holding 
   the model PSF be filled with zeros.

   - It is now possible to use CONTOUR to draw "pseudo-contours" which
   outline regions of the data array chosen in ways other than than by
   simple data thresholding. Setting MODE to "Good" will produce a
   curve which encloses all the good pixel values. Setting MODE to
   "Bounds" will produce a curve which traces the edges of the array. 

   - A new command call OUTLINE has been added which draws the outline of
   an NDF over an existing plot. It is a synonym for "contour mode=bounds".

   - The TextBackColour plotting attribute, which allows the background
   colour for text to be selected (or set transparent) has been documented 
   in SUN/95.
