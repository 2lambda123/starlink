1 KAPPA_Version_0.16

   A new release of KAPPA (V0.16) has been made. The changes are
   described fully in sun95.

   - A new command called LUTWARM has been added. It loads a colour 
   table which goes from black to white, passing through warm shades 
   of yellow and brown, as popularised by GAIA. 

   - THRESH may now be used to replace data between specified
   thresholds as well as outside specified thresholds, by setting 
   the lower threshold greater than the upper threshold.
