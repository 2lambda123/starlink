#  Name:
#     FITSHEAD
#
#  Purpose:
#     Lists the headers of FITS files.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     C-shell script
#
#  Usage:
#     fitshead file [block] [start] [finish]
#
#  Description:
#     This procedure lists to standard output the headers of the primary
#     header and data unit, and any extensions present that are
#     contained within a set of input FITS files, or a range of
#     specified files on a tape.
#
#  ADAM Parameters:
#     FILE  = FILENAME (Read)
#        A space-separated list of FITS files whose headers are to be
#        listed, or the name of a single no-rewind tape device.  The list
#        of files can include wildcard characters.
#     BLOCK = _INTEGER (Read)
#        The FITS blocking factor of the tape to list.  This is the tape
#        blocksize in bytes divided by the FITS record length of 2880
#        bytes.  BLOCK must be a positive integer, between 1 and 12,
#        otherwise you will be prompted for a new value.  Should the first
#        argument not be a tape device, this argument will be treated as
#        a file name. [1]
#     START = _INTEGER (Read)
#        The first file on the tape to list.  This defaults to 1, i.e.
#        the start of the tape.  It must be a positive integer,
#        otherwise you will be prompted for a new value.  Should the
#        first argument not be a tape device, this argument will be
#        treated as a file name. [1]
#     FINISH = _INTEGER (Read)
#        The last file on the tape to list.  This defaults to the end
#        of the tape.  It must be a positive integer and at least equal
#        to the value of start, otherwise you will be prompted for a new
#        value.  Should the first argument not be a tape device, this
#        argument will be treated as a file name. []
#
#  Notes:
#     -  Prompting is directed to the standard error, so that the listings
#     may be redirected to a file.
#     -  If the blocking factor is unknown it is possible to obtain only
#     a part of the headers and some of the FITS data.  Unless the FITS
#     file is small, it is usually safe to set parameter BLOCK higher
#     than its true value.
#
#  Examples:
#     fitshead /dev/nrmt1
#        This lists the FITS headers for all the files of the tape mounted
#        on device /dev/nrmt1.  The tape block size is 2880 bytes.
#     fitshead /dev/nrmt1 10 > tape.lis
#        This lists to file tape.lis the FITS headers for all the files of
#        the tape mounted on device /dev/nrmt1.  The tape blocking factor is
#        10, the tape's blocksize is 28800 bytes.
#     fitshead /dev/rmt/0n 2 3 5 >> tape.lis
#        This appends the FITS headers for files 3 to 5 of the tape mounted
#        on device /dev/rmt/0n to the file tape.lis.  The tape blocking factor
#        is 2, i.e. the tape's blocksize is 5760 bytes.
#     fitshead /dev/nrst2 prompt
#        This lists the FITS headers for files of the tape mounted on
#        device /dev/nrst2.  The command prompts you for the file limits
#        and tape blocking factor.
#     fitshead ~/fits/*.fit ~/data/p?.fi* | lpr
#        This prints the FITS headers in the files ~/fits/*.fit and
#        ~/data/p?.fi*.

#     1994 November 4 (MJC):
#        Original version.
#     1994 November 10 (MJC):
#        Added ADAM-like prompting user interface.
#     13-APR-2000 (DSB):
#        Added "bs=80" to the dd command at the end of the script to prevent 
#        an unwanted newline being added at 512 intervals.

#
#-
#
#   Specify the text search limits, and that we want to print the text
#   between these limits to standard output.  These look for lines
#   starting "SIMPLE  =" and "END " for a primary header and data unit,
#   and for lines starting "XTENSION=" and "END " for an extension.
#   If strict adherance to the FITS standard was followed the end of the
#   extraction should be /^END *$/, but sometimes people put in a comment
#   or equals sign.

#   prompt for the missing parameters; or the accept command by keyword
#   or its backslash abbreviation.  Form a new list and count of the
#   words on the command line, excluding these special keywords.
