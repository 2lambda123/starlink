*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GDNAMES( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     The routine displays a list of the graphics devices available and
*     the names (both traditional Starlink GNS names and the equivalent
*     PGPLOT names) which identify them.  Each name is accompanied by a
