      SUBROUTINE PICCUR ( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PICCUR

*  Purpose:
*     Uses a graphics cursor to change the current picture.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PICCUR( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application allows you to select a new current picture in
*     the graphics database using the cursor. Each time a position is
*     selected (usually by pressing a button on the mouse), details of
*     the topmost picture in the AGI database which encompasses that 
*     position are displayed, together with the cursor position (in
*     millimetres from the bottom left corner of the graphics device). 
*     On exit the last picture selected becomes the current picture.

*  Usage:
*     piccur [device] [name]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics workstation. [The current graphics device]
*     NAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        Only pictures of this name are to be selected.  For instance, if
*        you want to select a DATA picture which is covered by a 
*        transparent FRAME picture, then you could specify NAME=DATA.
*        A null (!) or blank string means that pictures of all names may 
*        be selected. [!]
*     SINGLE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then the user cna supply only one position using the
*        cursor, where-upon the application immediately exits, leaving
*        the selected picture as the current picture. If FALSE is supplied, 
*        then the user can supply multiple positions. Once all positions
*        have been supplied, a button is pressed to indicate that no more
*        positions are required. [FALSE]
*     QUIET = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, nothing is displayed on the screen while running.
*        [FALSE]

*  Examples:
*     piccur
*        This selects a picture on the current graphics device by use of 
*        the cursor.  The picture containing the last-selected point becomes 
*        the current picture.
*     piccur name=data
*        This is like the previous example, but only DATA pictures can be
*        selected.
