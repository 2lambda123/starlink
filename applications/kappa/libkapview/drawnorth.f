      SUBROUTINE DRAWNORTH( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DRAWNORTH

*  Purpose:
*     Draws arrows parallel to the axes.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DRAWNORTH( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application draws a pair of arrows on top of a previously
*     displayed DATA picture which indicate the directions of the
*     labelled axes in the underlying picture, at the position specified
*     by Parameter ORIGIN.  For instance, if the underlying picture has
*     axes labelled with celestial co-ordinates, then the arrows will
*     by default indicate the directions of north and east.  The
*     appearance of the arrows, including the labels attached to each
*     arrow, may be controlled using the STYLE parameter.  The picture
*     area behind the arrows may optionally be cleared before drawing
*     the arrows (see Parameter BLANK).

*  Usage:
*     drawnorth [device] [length] [origin]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ARROW = _REAL (Read)
*        The size of the arrow heads are specified by this parameter.
*        Simple lines can be drawn by setting the arrow head size to
*        zero. The value should be expressed as a fraction of the
*        largest dimension of the underlying DATA picture.
*        [current value]
*     BLANK = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then the area behind the arrows is blanked before the
*        arrows are drawn. This is done by drawing a rectangle filled
*        with the current background colour of the selected graphics
*        device.  The size of the blanked area can be controlled using
*        Parameter BLANKSIZE.  [FALSE]
*     BLANKSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        Specifies the size of the blanked area (see Parameter BLANK).
*        A value of 1.0 results in the blanked area being just large
*        enough to contain the drawn arrows and labels.  Values larger
*        than 1.0 introduce a blank margin around the drawn arrows and
*        labels.  This parameter also specifies the size of the picture
*        stored in the graphics database.  [1.05]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The plotting device.  [Current graphics device]
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the co-ordinate Frame to which the drawn arrows
*        refer.  If a null (!) value is supplied, the arrows are drawn
*        parallel to the two axes which were used to annotate the
*        previously displayed picture.  If the arrows are required to be
*        parallel to the axes of some other Frame, the required Frame
*        should be specified using this parameter.  The string supplied
*        for FRAME can be one of the following options.
*
*        - A domain name such as SKY, AXIS, PIXEL, etc.
*
*        - An integer value giving the index of the required Frame.
*
*        - A "Sky Co-ordinate System" (SCS) value such as EQUAT(J2000)
*        (see section "Sky Co-ordinate Systems" in SUN/95).
*
*        An error will be reported if a co-ordinate Frame is requested
*        which is not available in the previously displayed picture.  If
*        the selected Frame has more than two axes, the Parameter
*        USEAXIS will determine the two axes which are to be used.  [!]
*     LENGTH( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The lengths of the arrows, expressed as fractions of the
*        largest dimension of the underlying DATA picture.  If only one
*        value is supplied, both arrows will be drawn with the given
*        length.  One of the supplied values can be set to zero if only
*        a single arrow is required.  [current value]
*     OFRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the co-ordinate Frame in which the position of the
*        arrows will be supplied (see Parameter ORIGIN).  The following
*        Frames will always be available.
*
*        - "GRAPHICS" -- gives positions in millimetres from the
*        bottom-left corner of the plotting surface.
*
*        - "BASEPIC" -- gives positions in a normalised system in which
*        the bottom-left corner of the plotting surface is (0,0) and the
*        shortest dimension of the plotting surface has length 1.0.  The
*        scales on the two axes are equal.
*
*        - "CURPIC" -- gives positions in a normalised system in which
*        the bottom-left corner of the underlying DATA picture is (0,0)
*        and the shortest dimension of the picture has length 1.0.  The
*        scales on the two axes are equal.
*
*        - "NDC" -- gives positions in a normalised system in which the
*        bottom-left corner of the plotting surface is (0,0) and the
*        top-right corner is (1,1).
*
*        - "CURNDC" -- gives positions in a normalised system in which
*        the bottom-left corner of the underlying DATA picture is (0,0)
*        and the top-right corner is (1,1).
*
*        Additional Frames will be available, describing the
*        co-ordinates systems known to the data displayed within the
*        underlying picture.  These could include PIXEL, AXIS, SKY, for
*        instance, but the exact list will depend on the displayed data.
*        If a null value is supplied, the ORIGIN position should be
*        supplied in the Frame used to annotate the underlying picture
*        (supplying a colon ":" will display details of this
*        co-ordinate Frame).  ["CURNDC"]
*     ORIGIN = LITERAL (Read)
*        The co-ordinates at which to place the origin of the arrows,
*        in the Frame specified by Parameter OFRAME.  If a null (!)
*        value is supplied, OFRAME is ignored and the arrows are
*        situated at a default position near one of the corners, or at
*        the centre.  The supplied position can be anywhere within the
*        current picture.  An error is reported if the arrows and
*        labels cannot be drawn at any of these positions.  [!]
*     STYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to
*        use for the vectors and annotated axes.
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied. See section
*        "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description of the
*        available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are ignored
*        (no error is reported).
*
*        The appearance of the arrows is controlled by the attributes
*        Colour(Axes), Width(Axes), etc. (the synonym Arrows may be
*        used in place of Axes).
*
*        The text of the label to draw against each arrow is specified
*        by the Symbol(1) and Symbol(2) attributes.  These default to
*        that corresponding attributes of the underlying picture.  The
*        appearance of these labels can be controlled using the
*        attributes Font(TextLab), Size(TextLab), etc.  The gap between
*        the end of the arrow and the corresponding label can be
*        controlled using attribute TextLabGap.  The drawing of labels
*        can be suppressed using attribute TextLab. [current value]
*     USEAXIS = GROUP (Read)
*        USEAXIS is only accessed if the co-ordinate Frame selected
*        using Parameter FRAME has more than two axes.  A group of two
*        strings should be supplied specifying the two axes to which
*        the two drawn arrows should refer.  Each axis can be specified
*        using one of the following options.
*
*        - An integer index of an axis within the current Frame of the
*        input NDF (in the range 1 to the number of axes in the current
*        Frame).
*
*        - An axis symbol string such as "RA" or "VRAD".
*
*        - A generic option where "SPEC" requests the spectral axis,
*        "TIME" selects the time axis, "SKYLON" and "SKYLAT" picks the
*        sky longitude and latitude axes respectively.  Only those axis
*        domains present are available as options.
*
*        A list of acceptable values is displayed if an illegal value
*        is supplied.  If a null (!) value is supplied, the first two
*        axes of the Frame are used.  [!]

*  Examples:
*     drawnorth
*        Draws a pair of arrows indicating the directions of the axes of
*        the previously displayed image, contour map, etc. The arrows
*        are drawn at the top left of the picture. The current values
*        for all other parameters are used.
*     drawnorth blank origin="0.5,0.5" style='TextBackColour=clear'
*        As above, but blanks out the picture area behind the arrows,
*        and positions them in the middle of the underlying DATA
*        picture. In addition, the text labels are drawn with a clear
*        background so that the underlying image can seen around the
*        text.
*     drawnorth blank blanksize=1.2 oframe=pixel origin="150,250"
*        As above, but positions the arrows at pixel co-ordinates
*        (150,250), and blanks out a larger area around the arrows.
*     drawnorth blank oframe=! origin="10:12:34,-12:23:37"
*        As above, but positions the arrows at RA=10:12:34 and
*        DEC=-12:23:37 (this assumes the underlying picture was
*        annotated with RA and DEC axes).
*     drawnorth length=[0.1,0] style='colour(arrows)=red'
*        Draws the axis-1 arrow with length equal to 0.1 of the longest
*        dimension of the underlying picture, but does not draw the
*        axis-2 arrow. Both arrows are drawn red.
*     drawnorth style='textlab=0'
*        Draws both arrows but does not draw any text labels.
*     drawnorth style="'Size(TextLab1)=2,Symbol(1)=A,Symbol(2)=B'"
*        Draws arrows with labels "A" and "B", using characters of twice
*        the default size for the label for the first axis.

*  Notes:
*     -  An error is reported if there is no existing DATA picture
*     within the current picture on the selected graphics device.
*     -  The application stores a picture in the graphics database with
*     name KEY which contains the two arrows. On exit the current
*     database picture for the chosen device reverts to the input
*     picture.
