      SUBROUTINE PICEMPTY( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PICEMPTY

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the first empty FRAME picture in the graphics database.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PICEMPTY( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application selects the first, i.e. oldest, empty FRAME
*     picture in the graphics database for a graphics device.  Empty
*     means that there is no additional picture lying completely with
*     its bounds.  This implies that the FRAME is clear for plotting.
*     This task is probably most useful for plotting data in a grid of
*     FRAME pictures.

*  Usage:
*     picempty [device]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics workstation. [The current graphics device]

*  Examples:
*     picempty
*        This selects the first empty FRAME picture for the current
*        graphics device.
*     picempty xwindows
*        This selects the first empty FRAME picture for the xwindows
*        graphics device.

*  Notes:
*     -  An error is returned if there is no empty FRAME picture, and
*     the current picture remains unchanged.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: PICENTIRE, PICGRID, PICLAST, PICLIST, PICSEL, PICVIS.

*  Timing:
*     The execution time is approximately proportional to the number of
*     pictures in the database before the first empty FRAME picture is
*     identified.
