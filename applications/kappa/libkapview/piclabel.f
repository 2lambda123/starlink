      SUBROUTINE PICLABEL( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PICLABEL

*  Purpose:
*     Labels the current graphics-database picture.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PICLABEL( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application annotates the current graphics-database picture
*     of a specified device with a label you define.  This provides an
*     easy-to-remember handle for selecting pictures in subsequent
*     processing.

*  Usage:
*     piclabel label [device]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics device. [Current graphics device]
*     LABEL = LITERAL (Read)
*        The label to be given to the current picture.  It is limited
*        to 15 characters, but may be in mixed case.  If it is null (!)
*        a blank label is inserted in the database.

*  Examples:
*     piclabel GALAXY
*        This makes the current picture of the current graphics device
*        have a label of "GALAXY".
*     piclabel A3 xwindows
*        This labels the current xwindows picture "A3".

*  Notes:
*     The label must be unique for the chosen device.  If the new label
*     clashes with an existing one, then the existing label is deleted.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Get the label.  If it is null set the label to be blank.
*     -  Open the graphics device and start database activity.
*     -  Put the label into the database.
*     -  Annul the AGI device.
