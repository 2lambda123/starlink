      SUBROUTINE ARDPLOT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARDPLOT

*  Purpose:
*     Plot regions described in an ARD file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARDPLOT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application draws the outlines of regions described in
*     a supplied two-dimensional ARD file (an `ARD Description'--see
*     SUN/183). If there is an existing picture on the graphics device,
*     the outlines are drawn over the top of the previously displayed
*     picture, aligned (if possible) in the current co-ordinate Frame
*     of the previously drawn picture. If the graphics device is empty
*     (or if the CLEAR parameter is set TRUE) the outlines are drawn
*     using a default projection - the size of the area plotted can be
*     controlled by the SIZE parameter. Note, the facility to plot on
*     an empty device is currently only avaialble for 2-dimensional
*     regions specified using parameter REGION.

*  Usage:
*     ardplot ardfile [device] [regval]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ARDFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        The name of a file containing an `ARD Description' of the regions
*        to be outlined. The co-ordinate system in which positions within
*        this file are given should be indicated by including suitable
*        COFRAME or WCS statements within the file (see SUN/183), but will
*        default to pixel co-ordinates in the absence of any such
*        statements. For instance, starting the file with a line containing
*        the text "COFRAME(SKY,System=FK5)" would indicate that positions
*        are specified in RA/DEC (FK5,J2000). The statement "COFRAME(PIXEL)"
*        indicates explicitly that positions are specified in pixel
*        co-ordinates. The ARDFILE parameter is only accessed if
*        Parameter REGION is given a null (!) value.
*     CLEAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the current picture is to be cleared before the Region
*        is display. [FALSE]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The plotting device.  [Current graphics device]
*     REGION = FILENAME (Read)
*        The name of a file containing an AST Region to be outlined, or
*        null (!) if the ARD region defined by Parameter ARDFILE is to be
*        outlined. Suitable files can be created using the ATOOLS
*        package.  [!]
*     REGVAL = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Indicates which regions within the ARD description are to be
*        outlined. If zero (the default) is supplied, then the plotted
*        boundary encloses all the regions within the ARD file. If a
*        positive value is supplied, then only the region with the
*        specified index is outlined (the first region in the ARD file
*        has index 2, for historical reasons). If a negative value is
*        supplied, then all regions with indices greater than or equal
*        to the absolute value of the supplied index are outlined. See
*        SUN/183 for further information on the numbering of regions
*        within an ARD description. The REGVAL parameter is only accessed
*        if Parameter REGION is given a null (!) value.   [0]
*     SIZE = _REAL (Read)
*        The size of the plot to create, given as a multiple of the size
*        of the Region being plotted. This parameter is only accessed if
*        no DATA picture can be found on the graphics device, or CLEAR is
*        TRUE. A SIZE value of 1.0 causes the plot to be the same size as
*        the Region being plotted. A value of 2.0 causes the plot to be
*        twice the size of the Region, etc. [2.0]
*     STYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to use
*        for the curves.
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!)---the initial default---is
*        supplied.  To apply changes of style to only the current
*        invocation, begin these attributes with a plus sign.  A mixture
*        of persistent and temporary style changes is achieved by
*        listing all the persistent attributes followed by a plus sign
*        then the list of temporary attributes.
*
*        See section "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description
*        of the available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are
*        ignored (no error is reported).
*
*        The appearance of the plotted curves is controlled by the
*        attributes Colour(Curves), Width(Curves), etc.  [current value]

*  Examples:
*     ardplot bulge
*        Draws an outline around all the regions included in the ardfile
*        named "bulge". The outline is drawn on the current graphics device
*        and is drawn in alignment with the previous picture.

*  Notes:
*     -  A DATA picture must already exist on the selected graphics
*     device before running this command. An error will be reported if no
*     DATA picture can be found.
*     -  The application stores a new DATA picture in the graphics
*     database. On exit the current database picture for the chosen
*     device reverts to the input picture.
