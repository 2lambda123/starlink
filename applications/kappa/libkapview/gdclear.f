      SUBROUTINE GDCLEAR( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GDCLEAR

*  Purpose:
*     Clears a graphics device and purges its database entries.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GDCLEAR( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Usage:
*     gdclear [device] [current]

*  Description:
*     This application software resets a graphics device. In effect
*     the device is cleared.  It purges the graphics-database entries
*     for the device.  Optionally, only the current picture is cleared
*     and the database unchanged. (Note the clearing of the current
*     picture may not work on some graphics devices.)

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     CURRENT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then only the current picture is cleared. [FALSE]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The device to be cleared. [Current graphics device]

*  Examples:
*     gdclear
*        Clears the current graphics device and purges its graphics
*        database entries.
*     gdclear current
*        Clears the current picture on the current graphics device.
*     gdclear xw
*        Clears the xw device and purges its graphics database entries.

      CALL PAR_GTD0L( 'CURRENT', .FALSE., .TRUE., CURRNT, STATUS )

*  Open the graphics device in update mode. This does not clear the current 
*  picture. The PGPLOT viewport is set so that it corresponds to the current 
*  picture.
      CALL KPG1_PGOPN( 'DEVICE', 'WRITE', IPIC, STATUS )

*  If the whole display is to be cleared. Select the Base picture as the
*  current picture, and create a PGPLOT viewport from it.

*  Attempt to clear the viewport. This will only do anything if 
*  the device allows us to draw in the background colour. 
      CALL KPG1_PGCLR( STATUS )

*  If the whole screen was cleared, empty the database of all pictures
*  (except the Base picture).
      IF( .NOT. CURRNT ) CALL AGI_PDEL( STATUS )

*  Shut down the workstation and database, retaining the original current 
*  picture only if the whole screen has not been cleared.

*  If an error occurred, add a context message.
