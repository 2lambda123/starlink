      SUBROUTINE LUTVIEW( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     LUTVIEW

*  Purpose:
*     Draws a colour-table key.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LUTVIEW( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application displays a key to the current colour table on the
*     specified image display device using the whole of the current
*     colour table (excluding the low 16 pens which are reserved for
*     axis annotation, etc.).  The key can either be a simple
*     rectangular block of colour which ramps through the colour table,
*     a histogram-style key in which the width of the block reflects the
*     number of pixels allocated to each colour index, or a set of RGB
*     intensity curves.  The choice is made using the STYLE parameter.
*
*     By default, numerical data values are displayed along the long
*     edge of the key.  The values corresponding to the maximum and
*     minimum colour index are supplied using Parameters HIGH and LOW.
*     Intermediate colour indices are labelled with values which are
*     linearly interpolated between these two extreme values.
*
*     The rectangular area in which the key (plus annotations) is drawn
*     may be specified either using a graphics cursor, or by specifying
*     the co-ordinates of two corners using Parameters LBOUND and
*     UBOUND.  Additionally, there is an option to make the key fill the
*     current picture.  See Parameter MODE.  The key may be constrained
*     to the current picture using Parameter CURPIC.
*
*     The appearance of the annotation my be controlled in detail using
*     the STYLE parameter.

*  Usage:
*     lutview [mode] [low] [high] [curpic] [device]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The component (within the NDF given by Parameter NDF) which is
*        currently displayed.  It may be "Data", "Quality", "Variance",
*        or "Error" (where "Error" is an alternative to "Variance" and
*        causes the square root of the variance values to be used).  If
*        "Quality" is specified, then the quality values are treated as
*        numerical values (in the range 0 to 255).  The dynamic default
*        is obtained from global Parameter COMP which is set by
*        applications such as KAPPA:DISPLAY.  []
*     CURPIC = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If CURPIC is TRUE, the colour table key is to lie within the
*        current picture, otherwise the new picture can lie anywhere
*        within the BASE picture.  This parameter ignored if the
*        current-picture mode is selected.  [FALSE]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The image-display device on which the colour table is to be
*        drawn.  The device must be in one of the following GNS
*        categories: IMAGE_DISPLAY, IMAGE_OVERLAY, MATRIX_PRINTER, or
*        WINDOW, and have at least 24 greyscale intensities or colour
*        indices.  It must also not reset when the device is opened
*        (since the colour table would be lost) unless Parameter LUT
*        does not have the null value.  [Current image-display device]
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the co-ordinate Frame of the positions supplied using
*        Parameters LBOUND and UBOUND.  The following Frames will always
*        be available.
*
*        - "GRAPHICS" -- gives positions in millimetres from the
*        bottom-left corner of the plotting surface.
*
*        - "BASEPIC" -- gives positions in a normalised system in which
*        the bottom-left corner of the plotting surface is (0,0) and the
*        shortest dimension of the plotting surface has length 1.0.  The
*        scales on the two axes are equal.
*
*        - "CURPIC" -- gives positions in a normalised system in which
*        the bottom-left corner of the current picture is (0,0) and the
*        shortest dimension of the current picture has length 1.0.  The
*        scales on the two axes are equal.
*
*        - "NDC" -- gives positions in a normalised system in which the
*        bottom-left corner of the plotting surface is (0,0) and the
*        top-right corner is (1,1).
*
*        - "CURNDC" -- gives positions in a normalised system in which
*        the bottom-left corner of the current picture is (0,0) and the
*        top-right corner is (1,1).
*
*        There may be additional Frames available, describing previously
*        displayed data. If a null value is supplied, the current Frame
*        associated with the displayed data (if any) is used.  This
*        parameter is only accessed if Parameter MODE is set to "XY".
*        ["BASEPIC"]
*     HIGH = _REAL (Read)
*        The value corresponding to the maximum colour index.  It is
*        used to calculate the annotation scale for the key.  If it
*        is null (!) the maximum colour index is used, and histogram
*        style keys are not available.
*        [Current display linear-scaling maximum]
*     LBOUND = LITERAL (Read)
*        Co-ordinates of the lower-left corner of the rectangular region
*        containing the colour ramp and annotation, in the co-ordinate
*        Frame specified by Parameter FRAME (supplying a colon ":" will
*        display details of the selected co-ordinate Frame).  The
*        position should be supplied as a list of formatted axis values
*        separated by spaces or commas.  A null (!) value causes the
*        lower-left corner of the BASE or (if CURPIC is TRUE) current
*        picture to be used.
*     LOW = _REAL (Read)
*        The value corresponding to the minimum colour index.  It is
*        used to calculate the annotation scale for the key.  If it
*        is null (!) the minimum colour index is used, and histogram
*        style keys are not available.
*        [Current display linear-scaling minimum]
*     LUT = NDF (Read)
*        Name of the NDF containing a lookup table as its data array;
*        the lookup table is written to the image-display's colour
*        table.  The purpose of this parameter is to provide a means of
*        controlling the appearance of the image on certain devices,
*        such as colour printers, that do not have a dynamic colour
*        table, i.e. the colour table is reset when the device is
*        opened.  If used with dynamic devices, such as windows or
*        Ikons, the new colour table remains after this application has
*        completed.  A null, !, means that the existing colour table
*        will be used.
*
*        The LUT must be two-dimensional, the first dimension
*        being 3, and the second being arbitrary.  The method used to
*        compress or expand the colour table if the second dimension is
*        different from the number of unreserved colour indices is
*        controlled by Parameter NN.  Also the LUT's values must lie in
*        the range 0.0--1.0.  [!]
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Method for defining the position, size and shape of the
*        rectangular region containing the colour ramp and annotation.
*        The options are:
*
*        - "Cursor" --  The graphics cursor is used to supply two
*        diametrically opposite corners or the region.
*
*        - "XY" -- The Parameters LBOUND and UBOUND are used to get the
*        limits.
*
*        - "Picture" -- The whole of the current picture is used.
*        Additional positioning options are available by using other
*        KAPPA applications to create new pictures and then specifying
*        the picture mode.
*
*        ["Cursor"]
*     NDF = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF defining the image values to be used if a
*        histogram-style key is requested. This should normally be the
*        NDF currently displayed in the most recently created DATA
*        picture.  If a value is supplied on the command line for this
*        parameter it will be used.  Otherwise, the NDF to used is found
*        by interrogating the graphics database (which contains
*        references to displayed images).  If no reference NDF can be
*        obtained from the graphics database, the user will be prompted
*        for a value.
*     NN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If NN is TRUE, the input lookup table is mapped to the colour
*        table by using the nearest-neighbour method.  This preserves
*        sharp edges and is better for lookup tables with blocks of
*        colour.  If NN is FALSE, linear interpolation is used, and
*        this is suitable for smoothly varying colour tables.  NN is
*        ignored unless LUT is not null.  [FALSE]
*     STYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to
*        use for the annotation.
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!)---the initial default---is
*        supplied.  To apply changes of style to only the current
*        invocation, begin these attributes with a plus sign.  A mixture
*        of persistent and temporary style changes is achieved by
*        listing all the persistent attributes followed by a plus sign
*        then the list of temporary attributes.
*
*        See section "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description
*        of the available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are
*        ignored (no error is reported).
*
*        Axis 1 is always the "data value" axis, whether it is displayed
*        horizontally or vertically.  So for instance, to set the label
*        for the data value axis, assign a value to "Label(1)" in the
*        supplied style.
*
*        To get a ramp key (the default), specify "form=ramp".  To
*        get a histogram key (a coloured histogram of pen indices),
*        specify "form=histogram".  To get a graph key (three curves of
*        RGB intensities), specify "form=graph".  If a histogram key
*        is produced, the population axis can be either logarithmic or
*        linear. To get a logarithmic population axis, specify
*        "logpop=1".  To get a linear population axis, specify
*        "logpop=0" (the default).  To annotate the long axis with pen
*        numbers instead of pixel value, specify "pennums=1" (the
*        default, "pennums=0", shows pixel values).  [current value]
*     UBOUND = LITERAL (Read)
*        Co-ordinates of the upper-right corner of the rectangular
*        region containing the colour ramp and annotation, in the
*        co-ordinate Frame specified by Parameter FRAME (supplying a
*        colon ":" will display details of the selected co-ordinate
*        Frame).  The position should be supplied as a list of formatted
*        axis values separated by spaces or commas.  A null (!) value
*        causes the lower-left corner of the BASE or (if CURPIC is TRUE)
*        the current picture to be used.

*  Examples:
*     lutview
*        Draws an annotated colour table at a position selected via
*        the cursor on the current image-display device.
*     lutview style='form=hist,logpop=1'
*        As above, but the key has the form of a coloured histogram of
*        the pen numbers in the most recently displayed image.  The
*        second axis displays the logarithm (base 10) of the bin
*        population.
*     lutview style='form=graph,pennums=1'
*        The key is drawn as a set of three (or one if a monochrome
*        colour table is in use) curves indicating the red, green and
*        blue intensity for each pen. The first axis is annotated with
*        pen numbers instead of data values.
*     lutview style="'edge(1)=right,label(1)=Data value in m31'"
*        As above, but the data values are labelled on the right edge of
*        the box, and the values are labelled with the string
*        "Data value in m31".
*     lutview style='"textlab(1)=0,width(border)=3,colour(border)=white"'
*        No textual label is drawn for the data values, and a thicker
*        than usual white box is drawn around the colour ramp.
*     lutview style="'textlab(1)=0,numlab(1)=0,majticklen(1)=0'"
*        Only the border is drawn around the colour ramp.
*     lutview style="'textlab(1)=0,numlab(1)=0,majticklen(1)=0,border=0'"
*        No annotation at all is drawn.
*     lutview p
*        Draws a colour table that fills the current picture on the
*        current image-display device.
*     lutview curpic
*        Draws a colour table within the current picture positioned
*        via the cursor.
*     lutview xy lut=my_lut device=ps_p lbound="0.92,0.2" ubound="0.98,0.8"
*        Draws the colour table in the NDF called my_lut with an
*        outline within the BASE picture on the device ps_p, defined
*        by the x-y bounds (0.92,0.2) and (0.98,0.8).  In other words
*        the plot is to the right-hand side with increasing colour
*        index with increasing y position.
