      SUBROUTINE GDSTATE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GDSTATE

*  Purpose:
*     Shows the current status of a graphics device.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GDSTATE( STATUS )

*  Usage:
*     gdstate [device] [frame] 

*  Description:
*     This application displays information about the current graphics
*     database picture on a graphics device, including the extreme axis
*     values in any requested co-ordinate Frame (see parameter FRAME).
*     Information is written to various output parameters for use by
*     other applications, and is also written to the screen by default 
*     (see parameter REPORT). An outline may be drawn around the current
*     picture if required (see parameter OUTLINE).
*
*     A list of the colours in the current palette is also produced.

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     COMMENT = LITERAL (Write)
*        The comment of the current picture.  Up to 132 characters
*        will be written.
*     DESCRIBE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, a detailed description is displayed of the co-ordinate
*        Frame in which the picture bounds are reported (see parameter
*        FRAME). [current value]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        Name of the graphics device about which information is
*        required. [Current graphics device]
*     DOMAIN = LITERAL (Write)
*        The Domain name of the current co-ordinate Frame for the current 
*        picture.  
*     EPOCH = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        If a "Sky Co-ordinate System" specification is supplied (using 
*        parameter FRAME) for a celestial co-ordinate system, then an 
*        epoch value is needed to qualify it. This is the epoch at 
*        which the displayed sky co-ordinates were determined. It should 
*        be given as a decimal years value, with or without decimal places 
*        ("1996.8" for example). Such values are interpreted as a Besselian 
*        epoch if less than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch otherwise. 
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string determining the co-ordinate Frame in which the bounds
*        of the current picture are to be reported. When a picture is
*        created by an application such as PICDEF, DISPLAY, etc, WCS 
*        information describing the available co-ordinate systems are stored 
*        with the picture in the graphics database. This application can 
*        report bounds in any of the co-ordinate Frames stored with the
*        current picture. The string supplied for FRAME can be one of the 
*        following:
*
*        - A domain name such as SKY, AXIS, PIXEL, NDC, BASEPIC, CURPIC, etc. 
*        The special domain AGI_WORLD is used to refer to the world 
*        co-ordinate system stored in the AGI graphics database. This can 
*        be useful if no WCS information was store with the picture when 
*        it was created.
*
*        - An integer value giving the index of the required Frame.
*
*        - A "Sky Co-ordinate System" (SCS) value such as EQUAT(J2000) (see 
*        section "Sky Co-ordinate Systems" in SUN/95).
*
*        If a null value (!) is supplied, bounds are reported in the 
*        co-ordinate Frame which was current when the picture was created. 
*        [!]
*     LABEL = LITERAL (Write)
*        The label of the current picture.  It is blank if there is no
*        label.
*     NAME = LITERAL (Write)
*        The name of the current picture.
*     OUTLINE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If OUTLINE is TRUE, then an outline will be drawn around the
*        current picture to indicate its position. [FALSE]
*     REFNAM = LITERAL (Write)
*        The reference object associated with the current picture.  It
*        is blank if there is no reference object.  Up to 132 characters
*        will be written.
*     REPORT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If this is FALSE the state of the graphics device is not
*        reported, merely the results are written to the output
*        parameters.  It is intended for use within procedures. [TRUE]
*     STYLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to use 
*        when drawing the outline (see parameter OUTLINE). The format 
*        of the axis values reported on the screen may also be controlled.
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text file
*        preceded by an up-arrow character "^". Such text files should
*        contain further comma-separated lists which will be read and 
*        interpreted in the same manner. Attribute settings are applied in 
*        the order in which they occur within the list, with later settings
*        over-riding any earlier settings given for the same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*        
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value> is
*        the value to assign to the attribute. Default values will be
*        used for any unspecified attributes. All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied. See section "Plotting
*        Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description of the available
*        attributes. Any unrecognised attributes are ignored (no error is
*        reported). 
*
*        The appearance of the outline is controlled by the attributes
*        Colour(Border), Width(Border), etc (the synonym "Outline" may be
*        used in place of "Border"). In addition, the following attributes 
*        may be set in order to control the appearance of the formatted axis 
*        values reported on the screen: Format, Digits, Symbol, Unit. These
*        may be suffixed with an axis number (e.g. "Digits(2)") to refer to 
*        the values displayed for a specific axis. [current value]
*     X1 = LITERAL (Write)
*        The lowest value found within the current picture for axis 1 of the 
*        requested co-ordinate Frame (see parameter FRAME).
*     X2 = LITERAL (Write)
*        The highest value found within the current picture for axis 1 of the 
*        requested co-ordinate Frame (see parameter FRAME).
*     Y1 = LITERAL (Write)
*        The lowest value found within the current picture for axis 2 of the 
*        requested co-ordinate Frame (see parameter FRAME).
*     Y2 = LITERAL (Write)
*        The highest value found within the current picture for axis 2 of the 
*        requested co-ordinate Frame (see parameter FRAME).

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Examples:
*     gdstate
*        Shows the status of the current graphics device. The bounds of
*        the picture are displayed in the current co-ordinate Frame of
*        the picture.
*     gdstate ps_l basepic
*        Shows the status of the ps_l device. The bounds of the picture 
*        are displayed in the BASEPIC Frame (normalised device co-ordinates
*        in which the short of the two dimensions of the display surface
*        has length 1.0).
*     gdstate outline frame=pixel style="'colour=red,width=3'"
*        Shows the status of the current graphics device and draws a
*        thick, red outline around the current database picture. The 
*        bounds of the picture are displayed in the PIXEL co-ordinate 
*        Frame (if available).
*     gdstate refnam=(ndfname)
*        Shows the status of the current graphics device.  If there
*        is a reference data object, its name is written to the ICL
*        variable NDFNAME.
*     gdstate x1=(x1) x2=(x2) y1=(y1) y2=(y2) frame=basepic
*        Shows the status of the current graphics device.  The bounds
*        of the current picture in normalised device co-ordinates
*        are written to the ICL variables: X1, X2, Y1, Y2.

*  Notes:
*     -  The displayed bounds are the extreme axis values found anywhere 
*     within the current picture. In some situations these extreme
*     values may not occur on the edges of the picture. For instance, if
*     the current picture represents a region including the north
*     celestial pole, then displaying the picture bounds in celestial 
*     co-ordinates will give a declination upper limit of +90 degrees, 
*     whilst the RA limits will be 0 hours and (close to) 24 hours.
*     -  Previous versions of this application reported bounds in
*     "Normalised Device Co-ordinates". Similar functionality is now
*     provided by setting parameter FRAME to "BASEPIC". Be aware though,
*     that "Normalised Device Co-ordinates" were normalised so that the 
*     longer of the two axes had a length of 1.0, but BASEPIC co-ordinates
*     are normalised so that the shorter of the two axes has length 1.0.
*     - The Domain "NDC" now refers to a Frame in which the bottom left
*     corner of the device has co-ordinates (0,0) and the top right
*     corner has co-ordinates (1,1).
