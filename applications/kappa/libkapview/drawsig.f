      SUBROUTINE DRAWSIG ( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DRAWSIG

*  Purpose:
*     Draws +/-n standard-deviation lines on a line plot.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DRAWSIG( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status

*  Description:
*     This routine draws straight lines on an existing plot stored in
*     the graphics database, such as produced by LINPLOT or HISTOGRAM.
*     The lines are located at arbitrary multiples of the standard
*     deviation (NSIGMA) either side of the mean of a given dataset.
*     The default dataset is the one used to draw the existing plot.
*     You can plot the lines horizontally or vertically as appropriate.
*     The lines extend the full width or height of the plot's data
*     area.  Up to five different multiples of the standard deviation
*     may be presented in this fashion. Each line can be drawn with a
*     different style (see parameter STYLE).
*
*     The application also computes statistics for those array values
*     that lie between each pair of plotted lines.  In other words it
*     finds the statistics between clipping limits defined by each
*     2*NSIGMA range centred on the unclipped mean.
*
*     The task tabulates NSIGMA, the mean, the standard deviation, and
*     the error in the mean after the application of each pair of
*     clipping limits.  For comparison purposes the first line of the
*     table presents these values without clipping.  The table is
*     written at the normal reporting level.

*  Usage:
*     drawsig ndf nsigma [axis] [comp]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AXIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        The orientation of the lines, or put another way, the axis
*        which represents data value.  Thus the allowed values are
*        "Horizontal", "Vertical", "X", or "Y".  "Horizontal" is
*        equivalent to "Y" and "Vertical" is a synonym for "X".  On
*        LINPLOT output AXIS would be "Y", but on a plot from HISTOGRAM
*        it would be "X".  The suggested default is the current value.
*        ["Y"]
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the NDF array component from which to derive the
*        mean and standard deviation used to draw the lines: "Data",
*        "Error", "Quality" or "Variance" (where "Error" is the
*        alternative to "Variance" and causes the square root of the
*        variance values to be taken before computing the statistics).
*        If "Quality" is specified, then the quality values are treated
*        as numerical values (in the range 0 to 255).  ["Data"]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics device to draw the sigma lines on.
*        [Current graphics device]
*     NDF = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF structure containing the data array whose error limits
*        are to be plotted.  Usually this parameter is not defined
*        thereby causing the statistics to be derived from the dataset
*        used to draw the plot.  If, however, you had plotted a section
*        of a dataset but wanted to plot the statistics from the whole
*        dataset, you would specify the full dataset with parameter NDF.
*        [The dataset used to create the existing plot.]
*     NSIGMA() = _REAL (Read)
*        Number of standard deviations about the mean at which the
*        lines should be drawn.  The null value or 0.0 causes a line to
*        be drawn at the mean value.
*     STYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to use 
*        for the lines.
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text file
*        preceded by an up-arrow character "^". Such text files should
*        contain further comma-separated lists which will be read and 
*        interpreted in the same manner. Attribute settings are applied in 
*        the order in which they occur within the list, with later settings
*        over-riding any earlier settings given for the same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*        
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value> is
*        the value to assign to the attribute. Default values will be
*        used for any unspecified attributes. All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied. See section "Plotting
*        Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description of the available
*        attributes. Any unrecognised attributes are ignored (no error is
*        reported). 
*
*        The attributes Colour(Curves), Width(Curves), etc, can be used
*        to specify the style for the lines ("Lines" is recognised as a
*        synonym for "Curves"). These values apply to all
*        lines unless subsequent attributes over-ride them. Attributes for
*        individual clipping levels can be given by replacing "Curves" above 
*        by a string of the form "Nsig<i>" where "<i>" is an integer
*        index into the list of clipping levels supplied for parameter
*        NSIGMA. Thus, "Colour(Nsig1)" will set the colour for the lines
*        associated with the first clipping level, etc. The attribute 
*        settings can be restricted to one of the two lines by appending
*        either a "+" or a "-" to the "Nsig<i>" string. Thus,
*        "Width(Nsig2-)" sets the line width for the lower of the two
*        lines associated with the second clipping level, and "Width(Nsig2-)"
*        sets the width for the upper of the two lines. [current value]

*  Examples:
*     drawsig nsigma=3 style='style=1'
*        This draws solid horizontal lines on the last DATA picture on
*        the current graphics device located at plus and minus 3
*        standard deviations about the mean.  The statistics come from
*        the data array used to draw the DATA picture.
*     drawsig phot 2.5
*        This draws horizontal plus and minus 2.5 standard-deviation
*        lines about the mean for the data in the NDF called phot on
*        the default graphics device.
*     drawsig phot 2.5 style='"colour(nsig1-)=red,colour(nsig1+)=green"'
*        As above, but the lower line is drawn in red and the upper line
*        is drawn in green.
*     drawsig cluster [2,3] X Error
*        This draws vertical lines at plus and minus 2 and 3
*        standard deviations about the mean for the error data in the
*        NDF called cluster on the default graphics device.
*     drawsig device=xwindows phot(20:119) 3 style="'colour=red,style=4'"
*        This draws red dotted horizontal lines on the xwindows device
*        at +/- 3 standard deviations using the 100 pixels in NDF
*        phot(20:119).

*  Notes:
*     There must be an existing DATA picture stored within the graphics
*     database for the chosen device.  Lines will only be plotted
*     within this picture.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the DATA, VARIANCE, and
*     QUALITY, components of the NDF.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  The
*     statistics are calculated using double-precision floating point.
*     -  Any number of NDF dimensions is supported.

*     1996 October 16 (MJC):
*        Expanded the documentation.  Fixed a bug that caused the final
*        line always to be solid.  Added AXIS parameter.  Standardised
*        the code style.  Renamed parameter LINSTYLE to LINESTYLE.
*     6-MAY-1998 (DSB):
*        Update the GKS workstation after changing polyline
*        representations, and do not re-instate original representations
*        at end. This prevents the screen being cleared when the
*        workstation is closed.
*     27-OCT-1999 (DSB):
*        Major changes to use AST/PGPLOT for the graphics.
