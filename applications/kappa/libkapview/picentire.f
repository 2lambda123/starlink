      SUBROUTINE PICENTIRE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PICENTIRE

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the first unobscured and unobscuring FRAME picture in the
*     graphics database.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PICENTIRE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application selects the first, i.e. oldest, FRAME picture in
*     the graphics database for a graphics device, subject to the
*     following criterion.  The picture must not obstruct any other
*     picture except the BASE, and must itself not be obstructed.
*     Unobstructed means that there is no younger picture overlying it
*     either wholly or in part.  This means that plotting can occur
*     within the selected FRAME picture without overwriting or
*     obscuring earlier plots.

*  Usage:
*     picentire [device]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics workstation. [The current graphics device]

*  Examples:
*     picentire
*        This selects the first unobscured and unobscuring FRAME
*        picture for the current graphics device.
*     picentire xwindows
*        This selects the first unobscured and unobscuring FRAME picture
*        for the xwindows graphics device.

*  Notes:
*     -  An error is returned if there is no suitable FRAME picture,
*     and the current picture remains unchanged.
*     -  This routine cannot know whether or a picture has been cleared,
*     and hence is safe to reuse, as such information is not stored in
*     the graphics database.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: PICEMPTY, PICGRID, PICLAST, PICLIST, PICSEL, PICVIS.

*  Timing:
*     The execution time is approximately proportional to a linear
*     combination of the number of pictures in the database before the
*     unobstructed FRAME picture is found, and the square of the number
*     of pictures in the database.
