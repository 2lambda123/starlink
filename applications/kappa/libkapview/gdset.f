      SUBROUTINE GDSET( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GDSET

*  Purpose:
*     Selects a current graphics device.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GDSET( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application selects a current graphics device.  This device
*     will be used for all applications requiring an image-display
*     until changed explicitly.

*  Usage:
*     gdset device

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics device to become the current graphics device.

*  Examples:
*     gdset xwindows
*        Makes the xwindows device the current graphics device.
