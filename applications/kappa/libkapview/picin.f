      SUBROUTINE PICIN( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PICIN

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the attributes of a picture interior to the current picture.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PICIN( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application finds the attributes of a picture, selected by
*     name, that was created since the current picture and lies within
*     the bounds of the current picture.  The search starts from the
*     most-recent picture, unless the current picture is included,
*     whereupon the current picture is tested first.
*
*     The attributes reported are the name, comment, label, name of the
*     reference data object, the bounds in the co-ordinate Frame selected
*     by parameter FRAME.

*  Usage:
*     picin [name] [device] [frame]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     COMMENT = LITERAL (Write)
*        The comment of the picture.  Up to 132 characters will be written.
*     CURRENT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If this is {\tt TRUE}, the current picture is compared against the
*        chosen name before searching from the most-recent picture
*        within the current picture. [FALSE]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        Name of the graphics device about which information is
*        required. [Current graphics device]
*     DOMAIN = LITERAL (Write)
*        The Domain name of the current co-ordinate Frame for the picture.
*     EPOCH = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        If a "Sky Co-ordinate System" specification is supplied (using
*        parameter FRAME) for a celestial co-ordinate system, then an
*        epoch value is needed to qualify it. This is the epoch at
*        which the displayed sky co-ordinates were determined. It should
*        be given as a decimal years value, with or without decimal places
*        ("1996.8" for example). Such values are interpreted as a Besselian
*        epoch if less than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch otherwise.
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string determining the co-ordinate Frame in which the bounds
*        of the picture are to be reported. When a picture is
*        created by an application such as PICDEF, DISPLAY, etc, WCS
*        information describing the available co-ordinate systems are stored
*        with the picture in the graphics database. This application can
*        report bounds in any of the co-ordinate Frames stored with the
*        current picture. The string supplied for FRAME can be one of the
*        following:
*
*        - A domain name such as SKY, AXIS, PIXEL, BASEPIC, NDC, CURPIC, etc.
*        The special domain AGI_WORLD is used to refer to the world co-ordinate
*        system stored in the AGI graphics database. This can be useful if
*        no WCS information was store with the picture when it was created.
*
*        - An integer value giving the index of the required Frame.
*
*        - A "Sky Co-ordinate System" (SCS) value such as EQUAT(J2000) (see
*        section "Sky Co-ordinate Systems" in SUN/95).
*
*        If a null value (!) is supplied, bounds are reported in the
*        co-ordinate Frame which was current when the picture was created.
*        [!]
*     LABEL = LITERAL (Write)
*        The label of the picture.  It is blank if there is no label.
*     NAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the picture to be found within the current picture.
*        If it is null (!), the first interior picture is selected.
*        ["DATA"]
*     PNAME = LITERAL (Write)
*        The name of the picture.
*     REFNAM = LITERAL (Write)
*        The reference object associated with the picture.  It is blank if
*        there is no reference object.  Up to 132 characters will be written.
*     REPORT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If this is FALSE details of the picture are not reported, merely the
*        results are written to the output parameters.  It is intended for
*        use within procedures. [TRUE]
*     X1 = LITERAL (Write)
*        The lowest value found within the  picture for axis 1 of the
*        requested co-ordinate Frame (see parameter FRAME).
*     X2 = LITERAL (Write)
*        The highest value found within the  picture for axis 1 of the
*        requested co-ordinate Frame (see parameter FRAME).
*     Y1 = LITERAL (Write)
*        The lowest value found within the  picture for axis 2 of the
*        requested co-ordinate Frame (see parameter FRAME).
*     Y2 = LITERAL (Write)
*        The highest value found within the  picture for axis 2 of the
*        requested co-ordinate Frame (see parameter FRAME).

*  Examples:
*     picin
*        This reports the attributes of the last DATA picture within
*        the current picture for the current graphics device. The bounds
*        of the picture in its current co-ordinate Frame are reported.
*     picin frame=pixel
*        As above but the bounds of the picture in the PIXEL Frame are
*        reported.
*     picin refnam=(object) current
*        This reports the attributes of the last data picture within
*        the current picture for the current graphics device.  If there
*        is a reference data object, its name is written to the ICL
*        variable OBJECT.  The search includes the current picture.
*     picin x1=(x1) x2=(x2) y1=(y1) y2=(y2)
*        This reports the attributes of the last DATA picture within
*        the current picture for the current graphics device.  The
*        bounds of the current picture are written to the ICL
*        variables: X1, X2, Y1, Y2.

*  Notes:
*     This application is intended for use within procedures.  Also if
*     a DATA picture is selected and the current picture is included in
*     the search, this application informs about the same picture that
*     an application that works in a cursor interaction mode would
*     select, and so acts as a check that the correct picture will be
*     accessed.
