      SUBROUTINE PICVIS( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PICVIS

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the first unobscured FRAME picture in the graphics database.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PICVIS( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application selects the first, i.e. oldest, unobstructed
*     FRAME picture in the graphics database for a graphics device.
*     Unobstructed means that there is no younger picture overlying it
*     either wholly or in part.

*  Usage:
*     picvis [device]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics workstation. [The current graphics device]

*  Examples:
*     picvis
*        This selects the first unobscured FRAME picture for the
*        current graphics device.
*     picvis xwindows
*        This selects the first unobscured FRAME picture for the
*        xwindows graphics device.

*  Notes:
*     -  An error is returned if there is no unobscured FRAME picture,
*     and the current picture remains unchanged.
*     -  This routine cannot know whether or a picture has been cleared,
*     and hence is safe to reuse, as such information is not stored in
*     the graphics database.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: PICEMPTY, PICENTIRE, PICGRID, PICLAST, PICLIST, PICSEL.

*  Timing:
*     The execution time is approximately proportional to a linear
*     combination of the number of pictures in the database before the
*     unobstructed FRAME picture is found, and the square of the number
*     of pictures in the database.
