      SUBROUTINE PALDEF( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PALDEF

*  Purpose:
*     Loads the default palette to a colour table.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PALDEF( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application loads the standard palette of colours to fill
*     the portion of the current image display's colour table which is
*     reserved for the palette.  The palette comprises 16 colours and
*     is intended to provide coloured annotations, borders, axes,
*     graphs etc. that are unaffected by changes to the lookup table
*     used for images.

*     Pen 0 (the background colour) and pen 1 (the foreground colour) are 
*     set to the default values for the specified graphics device. Thus
*     they may be white on black for an X window, but black on white for
*     a printer. The other colours in the standard palette are:
*
*     - 2: Red
*     - 3: Green
*     - 4: Blue
*     - 5: Yellow 
*     - 6: Magenta
*     - 7: Cyan
*     - 8 to 15: Black

*  Usage:
*     paldef [device]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        Name of the image display to be used.  [Current image-display device]

*  Examples:
*     paldef 
*        This loads the standard palette into the reserved portion of
*        the colour table of the current image display.
*     paldef xwindows
*        This loads the standard palette into the reserved portion of
*        the colour table of the xwindows device.

*  Notes:
*     - The effects of this command will only be immediately apparent
*     when run on X windows which have 256 colours (or other similar 
*     pseudocolour devices). On other devices (for instance, X windows
*     with more than 256 colours) the effects will only become apparent 
*     when subsequent graphics applications are run.

*     KAPPA: PALENTRY, PALREAD, PALSAVE.

*     1991 July 19 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1994 January 24 (MJC):
*        Allowed the device to be a MATRIX_PRINTER.
*     30-OCT-1998 (DSB):
*        Modified to save current palette in the adam directory so that
*        subsequent PGPLOT applications can read it back in again.
*     22-JUL-1999 (TDCA):
*        Modified to use PGPLOT.

      END IF

*  Save the palette in the adam directory so that it can be read back
*  again by subsequent applications (PGPLOT resets the colour palette
*  when it opens a device, so the palette then needs to be re-instated).
*  The first two pens ( 0 and 1, the background and foreground colours) 
*  are not saved, but reset to their default (unspecified) values. This
*  means (for instance), that foreground text will be white on black 
*  on an xwindow, but black on white on a printer.

*  Close the graphics system.
