      SUBROUTINE PICDEF( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PICDEF

*  Purpose:
*     Defines a new graphics-database FRAME picture or an array of
*     FRAME pictures.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PICDEF( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates either one new graphics-database FRAME
*     picture or a grid of new FRAME pictures.  It offers a variety of
*     ways by which you can define a new picture's location and extent.
*     You may constrain a new picture to lie within either the current
*     or the BASE picture, and the new picture adopts the world
*     co-ordinate system of that reference picture.
*
*     You may specify a single new picture using one of three methods:
*       1.  moving a cursor to define the lower and upper bounds via
*           pressing choice number 1 (the application will instruct what
*           to do for the specific graphics device), provided a cursor
*           is available on the chosen graphics workstation;
*       2.  obtaining the bounds from the environment (in world
*           co-ordinates of the reference picture);
*       3.  or by giving a position and size for the new picture.  The 
*           position is specified by a two-character code. The first
*           controls the vertical location, and may be "T", "B", or "C"
*           to create the new picture at the top, bottom, or in the
*           centre respectively.  The second defines the horizontal
*           situation, and may be "L", "R", or "C" to define a new
*           picture to the left, right, or in the centre respectively.
*           Thus a code of "BR" will make a new picture in the
*           bottom-right corner.  The size of the new picture along each
*           axis may be specified either in centimetres, or as a 
*           fraction of the corresponding axis of the reference picture.
*           The picture may also be forced to have a specified aspect
*           ratio.
*
*     The picture created becomes the current picture on exit.
*
*     Alternatively, you can create an array of n-by-m equal-sized
*     pictures by giving the number of pictures in the horizontal and
*     vertical directions.  These may or may not be abutted.  For easy
*     reference in later processing the pictures may be labelled
*     automatically.  The label consists of a prefix you define,
*     followed by the number of the picture.  The numbering starts at a
*     defined value, usually one, and increments by one for each new
*     picture starting from the bottom-left corner and moving from left
*     to right to the end of the line.  This is repeated in each line
*     until the top-right picture.  Thus if the prefix were "GALAXY",
*     the start number is one and the array comprises three pictures
*     horizontally and two vertically, the top-left picture would have
*     the label "GALAXY4".  On completion the bottom-left picture in
*     the array becomes the current picture.

*  Usage:
*     picdef [mode] [fraction]
*        { xpic ypic prefix=?
*        { lbound ubound
*       mode

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ASPECT = _REAL (Read)
*        The aspect ratio (x/y) of the picture to be created in modes
*        other than Cursor, Array, and XY.  The new picture is the
*        largest possible with the chosen aspect ratio that will fit
*        within the part of the reference picture defined by the
*        fractional sizes (see parameter FRACTION).  The justification
*        comes from the value of MODE.  Thus to obtain the largest
*        picture parameter set FRACTION=1.0.  A null value (!) does not
*        apply an aspect-ratio constraint, and therefore the new
*        picture fills the part of the reference picture defined by the
*        fractional sizes.  [!]
*     CURRENT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the new picture is to lie within the current picture,
*        otherwise the new picture can lie anywhere within the BASE
*        picture.  In other words, when it is TRUE the current picture
*        is the reference picture, and when FALSE the base is the
*        reference picture.  [FALSE]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics device.  [Current graphics device]
*     FILL = _REAL (Read)
*        The linear filling factor for the Array mode.  In other words
*        the fractional size (applied to both co-ordinates) of the new
*        picture within each of the XPIC * YPIC abutted sections of
*        the picture being sub-divided.  Each new picture is located
*        centrally within the section.  A filling factor of 1.0 means
*        that the pictures in the array abut.  Smaller factors permit a
*        gap between the pictures.  For example, FILL = 0.9 would give
*        a gap between the created pictures of 10 per cent of the
*        height and width of each picture, with exterior borders of 5
*        per cent.  FILL must lie between 0.1 and 1.0.  [1.0]
*     FRACTION( ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The fractional size of the new picture along each axis,
*        applicable for modes other than Array, Cursor, and XY.  Thus
*        FRACTION controls the relative shape as well as the size of
*        the new picture.  If only a single value is given then it is
*        applied to both x and y axes, whereupon the new picture has
*        the shape of the reference picture.  So a value of 0.5 would
*        create a picture 0.25 the area of the current or BASE picture.
*        The default is 0.5, unless parameter ASPECT is not null, when
*        the default is 1.0. This parameter is not used if the picture
*        size is specified in centimetres using parameter SIZE.  []
*     LABELNO = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number used to form the label for the first (bottom-left)
*        picture in Array mode.  It cannot be negative. [1]
*     LBOUND( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        BASEPIC co-ordinates of the lower bounds that defines the new 
*        picture.  The BASEPIC co-ordinates of the bottom-left corner of
*        the BASE picture are (0,0).  The shorter dimension of the BASE 
*        picture has length 1.0, and the other axis has a length 
*        greater than 1.0.  The suggested default is the top-right of 
*        the current picture. (XY mode)
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Method for selecting the new picture. The options are "Cursor"
*        for cursor mode (provided the graphics device has one), "XY"
*        to select x-y limits, and "Array" to create a grid of
*        equal-sized FRAME pictures.  The remainder are locations 
*        specified by two characters, the first corresponding to the 
*        vertical position and the second the horizontal.  For the 
*        vertical, valid positions are T(op), B(ottom), or C(entre); 
*        and for the horizontal the options are L(eft), R(ight), or
*        C(entre).  ["Cursor"]
*     OUTLINE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, a box that delimits the new picture is drawn. [TRUE]
*     PREFIX = LITERAL (Read)
*        The prefix to be given to the labels of picture created in
*        Array mode.  It should contain no more than twelve characters.
*        If the empty string "" is given, the pictures will have
*        enumerated labels.  Note that the database can contain only
*        one picture with a given label, and so merely numbering labels
*        increases the chance of losing existing labels.  A ! response
*        means no labelling is required.  The suggested default is the
*        last-used prefix.
*     SIZE( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The size of the new picture along both axes, in centimetres,
*        applicable for modes other than Array, Cursor, and XY. If a 
*        single value is given, it is used for both axes.  If a null 
*        value (!) is given, then the size of the picture is determined 
*        by parameter FRACTION. [!]
*     UBOUND( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        BASEPIC co-ordinates of the upper bound that defines the new 
*        picture.  The BASEPIC co-ordinates of the bottom-left corner of
*        the BASE picture are (0,0).  The shorter dimension of the BASE
*        picture has length 1.0, and the other axis has a length greater
*        than 1.0. The suggested default is the top-right of the current
*        picture. (XY mode)
*     XPIC = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of new pictures to be formed horizontally in the
*        BASE or current picture in Array mode.  The total number of
*        new pictures is XPIC * YPIC.  The value must lie in the
*        range 1--20.  The suggested default is 2.
*     YPIC = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of new pictures to be formed vertically in the BASE
*        or current picture in Array mode.  The value must lie in the
*        range 1--20.  The suggested default is the value of parameter
*        XPIC.

*  Examples:
*     picdef tr
*        Creates a new FRAME picture in the top-right quarter of the
*        full display area on the current graphics device, and an
*        outline is drawn around the new picture.  This picture becomes
*        the current picture.
*     picdef bl aspect=1.0
*        Creates a new FRAME picture within the full display area on
*        the current graphics device, and an outline is drawn around
*        the new picture.  This picture is the largest square possible,
*        and it is justified to the bottom-left corner.  It becomes the
*        current picture.
*     picdef bl size=[15,10]
*        Creates a new FRAME picture within the full display area on
*        the current graphics device, and an outline is drawn around
*        the new picture.  This picture is 15 by 10 centimetres in size
*        and it is justified to the bottom-left corner.  It becomes the
*        current picture.
*     picdef cc 0.7 current nooutline
*        Creates a new FRAME picture situated in the centre of the
*        current picture on the current graphics device.  The new
*        picture has the same shape as the current one, but it is
*        linearly reduced by a factor of 0.7.  No outline is drawn
*        around it.  The new picture becomes the current picture.
*     picdef cc [0.8,0.5] current nooutline
*        As above except that its height is half that of the current
*        picture, and its width is 0.8 of the current picture.
*     picdef cu device=graphon
*        Creates a new FRAME picture within the full display area of
*        the Graphon device.  The bounds of the new picture are defined
*        by cursor interaction.  An outline is drawn around the new
*        picture which becomes the current picture.
*     picdef mode=a prefix=M xpic=3 ypic=2
*        Creates six new equally sized and abutting FRAME pictures
*        within the full display area of the current graphics device.
*        All are outlined.  They have labels M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and
*        M6.  The bottom-left picture (M1) becomes the current picture.
*     picdef mode=a prefix="" xpic=3 ypic=2 fill=0.8
*        As above except that the pictures do not abut since each is
*        0.8 times smaller in both dimensions, and the labels are 1,
*        2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
