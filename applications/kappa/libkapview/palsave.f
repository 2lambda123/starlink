      SUBROUTINE PALSAVE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PALSAVE

*  Purpose:
*     Saves the current palette of a colour table to an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PALSAVE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application reads the palette portion of the current image
*     display's colour table and saves it in an NDF.  The palette
*     comprises 16 colours and is intended to provide coloured
*     annotations, borders, axes, graphs etc. that are unaffected by
*     changes to the lookup table used for images.  Thus once you have
*     established a palette of colours you prefer, it is straightforward
*     to recover the palette at a future time.

*  Usage:
*     palsave palette [device] [title]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        Name of the image display to be used. [Current image-display device]
*     PALETTE = NDF (Write)
*        The NDF in which the current colour-table reserved pens are
*        to be stored.  Thus if you have created non-standard colours
*        for annotation, doodling, colour of axes etc. they may be
*        stored for future use.
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output NDF. ["KAPPA - Palsave"]

*  Examples:
*     palsave rustic
*        This saves the palette of the colour table of the current
*        image display into the NDF called RUSTIC.
*     palsave hitec xwindows title="Hi-tech-look palette"
*        This saves the palette of the colour table of the xwindows
*        device in the NDF called hitec.  The NDF has a title called
*        "Hi-tech-look palette".
