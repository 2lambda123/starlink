      SUBROUTINE PICLIST( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PICLIST

*  Purpose:
*     Lists the pictures in the graphics database for a device.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PICLIST( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application produces a summary of the contents of the
*     graphics database for a graphics device, and/or permits a picture
*     specified by its order in the list to be made the new current
*     picture.  The list may either be reported or written to a text
*     file.

*     The headed list has one line per picture.  Each line comprises
*     a reference number; the picture's name, comment (up to 24
*     characters), and label; and a flag to indicate whether or not
*     there is a reference data object associated with the picture.  A
*     `C' in the first column indicates that the picture that was
*     current when this application was invoked.  In the text file,
*     because there is more room, the name of the reference object is
*     given (up to 64 characters) instead of the reference flag.
*     Pictures are listed in chronological order of their creation.

*  Usage:
*     piclist [name] [logfile] [device] picnum=?

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics workstation. [The current graphics device]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Write)
*        The name of the text file in which the list of pictures will
*        be made.  A null string (!) means the list will be reported
*        to you.  The suggested default is the current value. [!]
*     NAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        Only pictures of this name are to be selected.  A null string
*        (!) or blanks means that pictures of all names may be selected.
*        [!]
*     PICNUM = LITERAL (Read)
*        The reference number of the picture to be made the current
*        picture when the application exits.  PICNUM="Last" selects the
*        last picture in the database.  Parameter PICNUM is not accessed
*        if the list is written to the text file.  A null (!) or any
*        other error causes the current picture on entry to be current
*        again on exit.  The suggested default is null.

*  Examples:
*     piclist
*        This reports all the pictures in the graphics database for the
*        current graphics device.
*     piclist device=ps_l
*        This reports all the pictures in the graphics database for the
*        ps_l device.
*     piclist data
*        This reports all the DATA pictures in the graphics database for
*        the current graphics device.
*     piclist data logfile=datapic.dat
*        This lists all the DATA pictures in the graphics database for
*        the current graphics device into the text file datapic.dat.
*     piclist frame picnum=5
*        This selects the fifth most ancient FRAME picture (in the
*        graphics database for the current graphics device) as the
*        current picture.  The pictures are not listed.
*     piclist picnum=last
*        This makes the last picture in the graphics database for the
*        current graphics device current.  The pictures are not listed.

*  Notes:
*     -  The list is not reported to the user when PICNUM is specified
*     on the command line.  This feature is useful where a procedure 
*     just wants to select a new current picture (hiding the details
*     from the user).  A new current picture cannot be selected with
*     text-file output, and so the presence of PICNUM on the command
*     line does not affect writing to a text file.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: PICBASE, PICDATA, PICEMPTY, PICENTIRE, PICFRAME, PICIN,
*     PICLAST, PICSEL, PICVIS.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  Assumes that there are no more than 9999 pictures in the
*     database.

*  Timing:
*     The execution time is approximately proportional to the number of
*     pictures in the database for the chosen graphics device.
*     Selecting only a subset by name is slightly faster.
