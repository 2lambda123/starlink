      SUBROUTINE LUTABLE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     LUTABLE

*  Purpose:
*     Manipulates an image-display colour table.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LUTABLE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application allows manipulation of the colour table of an
*     image-display device provided some data are, according to the
*     graphics database, already displayed upon the device.  A
*     2-dimensional data array, stored in the input NDF structure, may
*     be nominated to assist in defining the colour table via an
*     histogram equalisation.  There are two stages to the running of
*     this application.

*     1. The way in which the lookup table (LUT) is to distributed
*     amongst the pens (colour indices) of the colour table is
*     required.  Some pens are reserved by KAPPA as a palette,
*     particularly for annotation.  This application only modifies the
*     unreserved portion of the colour table.
*        
*     2. The lookup table is now chosen from a programmed selection or
*     read from an NDF.

*     The two stages may be repeated cyclically if desired.  To exit the
*     loop give the null response, !, to a prompt.  Looping will not
*     occur if the lookup table and the distribution method are supplied
*     on the command line.

*  Usage:
*     lutable mapping coltab lut [device] ndf percentiles shade

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        Name of the image display to be used. [Current image-display device]
*     COLTAB = LITERAL (Read)
*        The lookup table required.  The options are listed below.
*          "Negative"  - This is negative grey scale with black assigned
*                        to the highest pen, and white assigned to the
*                        lowest available pen.
*          "Colour"    - This consists of eighteen standard colour
*                        blocks.
*          "Grey"      - This a standard grey scale.
*          "External"  - Obtain a lookup table stored in an NDF's data
*                        array.  If the table cannot be found in the
*                        specified NDF or if it is not a LUT then a
*                        grey scale is used.
*     FULL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE the whole colour-table for the device is stored
*        including the reserved pens.  This is necessary to save a
*        colour table written by another package that does not reserve
*        colour indices.  For colour tables produced by KAPPA this
*        should be FALSE. [FALSE]
*     LUT = NDF (Read)
*        Name of the NDF containing the lookup table as its data
*        array.  The LUT must be 2-dimensional, the first dimension
*        being 3, and the second being arbitrary.  The method used to
*        compress or expand the colour table if the second dimension is
*        different from the number of unreserved colour indices is
*        controlled by parameter NN.  Also the LUT's values must lie in
*        the range 0.0--1.0.
*     MAPPING = LITERAL (Read)
*        The way in which the colours are to be distributed among
*        the pens.  If NINTS is the number of unreserved colour indices
*        the mapping options are described below.
*
*          "Histogram"   - The colours are fitted to the pens using
*                          histogram equalisation of an NDF, given by
*                          parameter IN, so that the colours
*                          approximately have an even distribution. In
*                          other words each pen is used approximately
*                          an equal number of times to display the
*                          2-dimensional NDF array.  There must be an
*                          existing image displayed.  This is
*                          determined by looking for a DATA picture in
*                          the database.  This is not foolproof as this
*                          may be a line plot rather an image.
*          "Linear"      - The colours are fitted directly to the pens.
*          "Logarithmic" - The colours are fitted logarithmically to
*                          the pens, with colour 1 given to the first
*                          available pen and colour NINTS given to the
*                          last pen.
*     NDF = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF structure containing the 2-dimensional data
*        array to be used for the histogram-equalisation mapping of the
*        pens.  The the data object referenced by the last DATA picture
*        in the graphics database is reported.  This assumes that the
*        displayed data picture was derived from the nominated NDF data
*        array.
*     NN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE the input lookup table is mapped to the colour table by
*        using the nearest-neighbour method.  This preserves sharp
*        edges and is better for lookup tables with blocks of colour.
*        If NN is FALSE linear interpolation is used, and this is
*        suitable for smoothly varying colour tables. [FALSE]
*     PERCENTILES( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The percentiles that define the range of the histogram to be
*        equalised. For example, [25,75] would scale between the
*        quartile values. It is advisable not to choose the limits
*        less than 3 per cent and greater than 97.  The percentiles are
*        only required for histogram mapping.  All values in the NDF's
*        data array less than the value corresponding to the lower
*        percentile will have the colour of the first unreserved pen.
*        All values greater than the value corresponding to the upper
*        percentile will have the colour of the last unreserved pen.
*     SHADE = _REAL (Read)
*        The type of shading.  This only required for the histogram
*        mapping.  A value of -1 emphasises low values; +1 emphasises
*        high values; 0 is neutral, all values have equal weight.  The
*        shade must lie in the range -1 to +1.

*  Examples:
*     lutable lo co
*        Changes the colour table on the current image-display device
*        to a series of coloured blocks whose size increase
*        logarithmically with the table index number.
*     lutable li ex rococo
*        This maps the lookup table stored in the NDF called rococo
*        linearly to the colour table on the current image-display
*        device.
*     lutable li ex rococo full
*        This maps the lookup table stored in the NDF called rococo
*        linearly to the full colour table on the current image-display
*        device, i.e. ignoring the reserved pens.
*     lutable hi gr ndf=nebula shade=0 percentiles=[5 90]
*        This maps the greyscale lookup table via histogram
*        equalisation between the 5 and 90 percentiles of an NDF called
*        nebula to the colour table on the current image-display
*        device.  There is no bias or shading to white or black.

*  Notes:
*     - The effects of this command will only be immediately apparent
*     when run on X windows which have 256 colours (or other similar 
*     pseudocolour devices). On other devices (for instance, X windows
*     with more than 256 colours) the effects will only become apparent 
*     when subsequent graphics applications are run.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported for the image NDF
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  Processing
*     is performed using single- or double-precision floating point,
*     as appropriate.

*        Modified to use PGPLOT.
*     30-SEP-1999 (DSB):

*     10-OCT-2001 (DSB):
*        Most of code moved into kps1_ltaba in order to remove fixed
*        limit on the size of the colour table.
