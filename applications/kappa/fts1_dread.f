      SUBROUTINE FTS1_DREAD ( LU, BLKSIZ, ACTSIZ, LINIT, BUFFER, 
     :                        OFFSET, RECORD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_DREAD

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a FITS record from a disk file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_DREAD ( LU, BLKSIZ, ACTSIZ, LINIT, BUFFER, OFFSET,
*    :                  RECORD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine reads the byte stream from the FITS disk file
*     and extracts a FITS record of 2880 bytes.  The blocksize of
*     the disk file is arbitrary save that it be no more than the
*     maximum FITS blocksize of 28800.

*  Arguments:
*     LU = INTEGER (Given)
*        The logical unit number for the disk-FITS file.
*     BLKSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum blocksize and dimension of the file block.
*     ACTSIZ = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The actual block size.  This need not be a multiple of the
*        FITS record length of 2880 bytes.  It must be known on input.
*     LINIT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, the current record counter (RECNUM) is reset to one.
*        Should be true if a file is being read for the first time.
*     BUFFER( ACTSIZ ) = BYTE (Given and Returned)
*        The buffer containing the block of data. This is only read
*        when %OFFSET does not equal %ACTSIZ, i.e. there are some
*        non-header data within it.
*     OFFSET = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of bytes in the current block already interpreted.
*     RECORD( 2880 ) = BYTE (Returned)
*        The current FITS record.  Successive calls will read of the
*        FITS records in sequence.
*     STATUS  = INTEGER(Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     There are two modes of operation: where the tape blocks are
*     smaller than the FITS record length of 2880 bytes, or where the
*     block length is greater or equal to the FITS record.
*     -  If the latter, copy a whole FITS record from the file provided
*     there are sufficient bytes remaining, incrementing the offset by
*     a record length.  Otherwise fill the record in two stages, the
*     second after reading a new file block.  The new offset is
*     calculated.
*     -  If the former, copy any remainder of a disk block to the FITS
*     record.  Find the number of whole disk blocks will fit in the
*     remainder of the FITS record.  Read this number of disk blocks
*     and copy them to the FITS record.  If the FITS record is not
*     complete read the next disk record, and fill the record. Finally,
*     compute the offset within the current disk block.

*  Prior requirements:
*     -  The disk file should already be open and the first block
*     read.

*  History:
*     1990 November 30 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1992 December (RDS):
*        Modified for portability. It now finds the operating system
*        and then either makes a sequential access read if being run 
*        on the VAX or otherwise a direct access read. The current
*        record number is stored as a local variable. This can be
*        reset to one by setting the input argument LINIT to true.
