1 PICGRID
Creates an array of FRAME pictures

Usage:

   picgrid xpic ypic

Description:

   This command creates a two-dimensional grid of equally sized
   new FRAME pictures in the graphics database.  The array of
   pictures do not have to abut, but abutting is the default.  The
   new pictures are formed within either the current or BASE
   picture, and they adopt the world co-ordinate system of that
   enclosing picture.  On completion, the bottom-left picture in the
   array becomes the current picture.

   For easy reference in later processing the pictures have integer
   labels.  The numbering starts at a defined value, usually one,
   and increments by one for each new picture starting from the
   bottom-left corner and moving from left to right to the end of
   the line.  This is repeated in each line until the top-right
   picture.

   This command is a synonym for "picdef array 1.0 false prefix="".
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 CURRENT
CURRENT = _LOGICAL (Read)
   TRUE if the new pictures are to lie within the current picture,
   otherwise the new pictures can lie anywhere within the BASE
   picture.  In other words, when CURRENT is TRUE the current picture
   is the reference picture, and when it is FALSE the BASE is the
   reference picture. [FALSE]
3 DEVICE
DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
   The graphics device. [Current graphics device]
3 FILL
FILL = _REAL (Read)
   The linear filling factor for the array.  In other words the
   fractional size (applied to both co-ordinates) of the new
   picture within each of the XPIC * YPIC abutted sections of
   the picture being sub-divided.  Each new picture is located
   centrally within the section.  A filling factor of 1.0 means
   that the pictures in the array abut.  Smaller factors permit a
   gap between the pictures.  For example, FILL = 0.9 would give
   a gap between the created pictures of 10 per cent of the
   height and width of each picture, with exterior borders of 5
   per cent.  FILL must lie between 0.1 and 1.0. [1.0]
3 LABELNO
LABELNO = _INTEGER (Read)
   The number used to form the label for the first (bottom-left)
   picture.  It cannot be negative. [1]
3 OUTLINE
OUTLINE = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE, a box that delimits the new picture is drawn. [TRUE]
3 XPIC
XPIC = _INTEGER (Read)
   The number of new pictures to be formed horizontally in the
   BASE picture.  The total number of new pictures is XPIC * YPIC.
   The value must lie in the range 1--20.  The suggested default is 2.
3 YPIC
YPIC = _INTEGER (Read)
   The number of new pictures to be formed vertically in the
   BASE picture.  The total number of new pictures is XPIC * YPIC.
   The value must lie in the range 1--20.  The suggested default is 2.
   The suggested default is the value of parameter XPIC.
2 Examples
picgrid 3 2
   Creates six new equally sized and abutting FRAME pictures within
   the full display area of the current graphics device.  All the
   pictures are outlined.  They have labels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
   The bottom-left picture (1) becomes the current picture.

picgrid xpic=3 ypic=2 fill=0.8 labelno=11 nooutline
   As above except that the pictures do not abut since each is
   0.8 times smaller in both dimensions, the labels are 11 to
   16, and there are no picture outlines drawn.

picgrid device=xw current \
   This creates a 2-by-2 grid of new FRAME pictures within the
   current picture on device xw.
