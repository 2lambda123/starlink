#  Name:
#     FITSEDIT

#  Purpose:
#     Edits the FITS extension of an NDF.

#  Language:
#     C-shell

#  Type of Module:
#     C-shell script

#  Description:
#     This procedure allows you to use your favourite editor to
#     modify the FITS headers stored in an NDF's FITS extension.
#     There is limited validation of the FITS headers after editing.
#     A FITS extension is created if the NDF does not already have 
#     one.

#  Usage:
#     fitsedit ndf

#  ADAM Parameters:
#     NDF = NDF (Read)
#        The name of the NDF whose FITS extension is to be edited.

#  Examples:
#     fitsedit m51b
#        This allows editing of the FITS headers in the NDF called m51b.

#  Notes:
#     -  This uses the environmental variable, EDITOR, to select
#     the editor.  If this variable is undefined vi is assumed.
#     -  The script lists the headers to a temporary file; allows text 
#     editing; and then replaces the former FITS extension with the
#     modified version, performing some validation at this stage.

#  History:
#     1994 September 28 (MJC):
#        Original version.
#     1994 November 4 (MJC):
#        Added ADAM-like help and abort facility for the parameter.
#     1996 January 16 (MJC):
#        Added suggested default and search path for foreign data
#        formats.
#     5-JUN-1998 (DSB):
#        Added facility to create a new FITS extension if there is no 
#        existing FITS extension in the NDF.
#     2-FEB-2000 (DSB):
#        Guard against GLOBAL.sdf not existing by checking $status after
#        running parget. Interpret a single exclamation mark as an abort 
#        request. Do not include an escaped new line before awk since this
#        produces a "null command" error. Explicitly remove any shell
#        metacharacters (such as "$") from the NDF name.
#     3-FEB-2000 (DSB):
#        Corrected implementation of yesterdays changes, and modified the
#        "echo -n" commands to use the csh built-in echo command in place
#        of the sh built-in echo command which does not seem to recognize
#        the -n option on Solaris.
