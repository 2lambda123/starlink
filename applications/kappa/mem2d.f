      SUBROUTINE MEM2D( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     MEM2D

*  Purpose:
*     Performs a Maximum-Entropy deconvolution of a 2-dimensional NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MEM2D( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     MEM2D is based on the Gull and Skilling Maximum-Entropy package
*     MEMSYS3.  It takes an image and a Point-Spread Function as input
*     and produces an equal-sized image as output with higher
*     resolution.  Facilities are provided to `analyse' the resulting
*     deconvolved image, i.e. to calculate an integrated flux in some
*     area of the deconvolved image and also an estimate of the
*     uncertainty in the integrated flux.  This allows the significance
*     of structure visible in the deconvolution to be checked.
*
*     For a detailed description of the algorithm, and further
*     references, see the MEMSYS Users' Manual, and SUN/117.

*  Usage:
*     mem2d in out mask=? { fwhmpsf=?
*                         { psf=?
*                         psftype

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ANALYSE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        ANALYSE should be given a TRUE value if an analysis of a
*        previously generated deconvolution is to be performed, instead
*        of a whole new deconvolution being started.  An analysis
*        returns the integrated flux in some area of the deconvolved
*        image you specify, together with the standard deviation on the
*        integrated flux value.  The area to be integrated over is
*        specified by an image associated with parameter MASK.  This
*        facility can, for instance, be used to assess the significance
*        of structure seen in the deconvolution.  An analysis can only
*        be performed if the input NDF (see parameter IN) contains a
*        MEM2D extension (see parameter EXTEND).  If the input does
*        contain such an extension, and if the extension shows that the
*        deconvolution was completed, then ANALYSE is defaulted to
*        TRUE, otherwise it is defaulted to FALSE. []
*     DEF = _REAL (Read)
*        This is the value to which the output image will default in
*        areas for which there is no valid data in the input.  The `zero
*        entropy' image is defined to be a flat surface with value
*        given by parameter DEF.  Any deviation of the output image away
*        from this image will cause its entropy to become negative.
*        Thus a maximum-entropy criterion causes the output image to be
*        as similar as possible to a flat surface with value DEF
*        (within the constraints of the data).  DEF is defaulted to the
*        mean data value in the input image and must always be strictly
*        positive. []
*     DSUM = _REAL (Write)
*        This is an output parameter to which is written the standard
*        deviation of the integrated-flux value calculated if an
*        analysis is performed (see parameter ANALYSE).
*     EXTEND = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If EXTEND has a TRUE value, then the output NDF will contain
*        an extension called MEM2D which will contain all the
*        information required to either restart or analyse the
*        deconvolution.  Note, including this extension makes the output
*        file much bigger (by about a factor of seven).  [TRUE]
*     FWHMICF = _REAL (Read)
*        This is the Full Width at Half Maximum (in pixels) of a
*        Gaussian Intrinsic Correlation Function (ICF) to be used in
*        the deconvolution.  The ICF can be used to encode prior
*        knowledge of pixel-to-pixel correlations in the output image.
*        A value of zero for FWHMICF causes no ICF to be used, and so
*        no correlations are expected in the output.  Larger values
*        encourage smoothness in the output on the scale of the ICF.  If
*        a non-zero ICF is used, the image entropy which is maximised
*        is not the output image, but a `hidden' image.  This hidden
*        image is the deconvolution of the output image with the ICF,
*        and is assumed to have no pixel-to-pixel correlations. [2]
*     FWHMPSF = _REAL (Read)
*        This is the Full Width at Half Maximum (in pixels) of a
*        Gaussian Point-Spread Function (PSF).  This PSF is used to
*        deconvolve the input only if parameter PSFTYPE has the value
*        "Gaussian".
*     ILEVEL = _INTEGER (Read)
*        ILEVEL controls the amount of information displayed as MEM2D
*        runs.  If set to zero then no information is displayed.  Larger
*        values up to a maximum of 3, give larger amounts of
*        information.  A value of 3 gives full MEMSYS3 diagnostics
*        after each iteration. [1]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF.  This can either contain an image to be
*        deconvolved, or the output from a previous run of MEM2D.  The
*        NDF is considered to be an output from MEM2D if it contains an
*        extension called MEM2D (see parameter EXTEND).  If such an
*        extension is found, a check is made to see if the NDF contains
*        a completed deconvolution or a partial deconvolution.  If the
*        deconvolution is complete, the ANALYSE parameter is defaulted
*        to TRUE, and unless you override this default, an analysis of
*        the deconvolution contained in the input NDF is performed.  If
*        the input deconvolution is not complete, then the
*        deconvolution process is restarted from where it left off.  If
*        no MEM2D extension is found, then a new deconvolution is
*        started from scratch.
*     MASK = NDF (Read)
*        An image to use as a mask to define the areas to be integrated
*        when performing an analysis (see parameter ANALYSE).  The
*        integrated-flux value calculated by the analysis is actually
*        the total data sum in the product of the mask and the
*        deconvolved image.  Mask pixel values can be positive or
*        negative (or zero) and so, for instance, masks can be arranged
*        which subtract off a background brightness from a source
*        before returning the integrated source flux.
*     MODEL = NDF (Read)
*        An image to use as the default model for the reconstruction.
*        If a null value is given, then a constant value given by the
*        parameter DEF is used to define a flat default model.  The
*        section of the given image which matches the bounds of the
*        input image is used.  Any bad pixels in the image cause the
*        corresponding pixels in the input image to be ignored.  Such
*        pixels are set bad in the output.  The model image should
*        contain no pixels with a value of zero or less.  The default
*        model is defined to have zero entropy.  The hidden image will
*        tend to the default model in the absence of data.  It should be
*        noted that this model applies to the `hidden' image, not the
*        actually required reconstructed image.  The reconstructed image
*        is obtained from the hidden image by blurring the hidden image
*        with the ICF. [!]
*     MODELOUT = NDF (Write)
*        An image which can be used for the default model in a further
*        run of MEM2D.  Each pixel value in the created image is a
*        linear combination of the model value at the corresponding
*        pixel in the current reconstruction, and the hidden image
*        pixel value.  Pixels for which the hidden image is well away
*        from the current model, tend towards the value of the hidden
*        image; pixels for which the hidden image is close to the
*        current model tend towards the model.  Running MEM2D several
*        times, using the new model created on the previous run as the
*        model for the current run, can reduce the `mottling' often
*        seen in MEM2D reconstructions. [!]
*     NITER = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The maximum number of maximum-entropy iterations to perform.
*        MEM2D continues the deconvolution until either MEMSYS3
*        indicates that the termination criterion (omega=1.0) has been
*        reached, or the maximum number of iterations is reached.  If a
*        deconvolution requires more iterations than was allowed by
*        NITER, then you can choose to continue the deconvolution by
*        giving the prematurely terminated output from MEM2D as the
*        input to another run of MEM2D, specifying a larger value for
*        NITER. [50]
*     NOISE = LITERAL (Read)
*        NOISE defines the noise statistics within the input image.  It
*        can take the value "Gaussian" or "Poisson".  If Gaussian noise
*        is selected, the data variances are set initially to the
*        values stored in the VARIANCE component of the input NDF.  If
*        no such component exists, then the data variances are set to a
*        constant value equal to the RMS difference between adjacent
*        pixels in the x direction.  MEMSYS3 scales these initial noise
*        estimates to maximise the data `evidence'.  The evidence is
*        displayed as "LOG(PROB)" and the noise scaling factor as
*        "SIGMA", if parameter ILEVEL is set to 2 or more.  If Poisson
*        statistics are selected the uncertainty in each data value is,
*        as usual, of the order of the square root of the data value.
*        When using Poisson statistics, there is no equivalent to the
*        noise scaling performed when using Gaussian statistics.  Any
*        input VARIANCE component is ignored. ["Gaussian"]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output image in a `primitive' NDF.  The output is the same
*        size as the input.  Any pixels which were flagged as bad in
*        the input will also be bad in the output.  If parameter EXTEND
*        is TRUE, then the output NDF contains an extension called
*        MEM2D containing information which allows the deconvolution to
*        be either continued or analysed.  There is no VARIANCE
*        component in the output, but any QUALITY values are propagated
*        from the input to the output.  If parameter UPDATE is TRUE
*        then the output NDF is created after the first iteration and
*        is updated after each subsequent iteration.
*     PSF = NDF (Read)
*        An NDF holding an estimate of the Point Spread Function (PSF)
*        of the input image.  This PSF is used to deconvolve the input
*        only if parameter PSFTYPE has the value "NDF".  The PSF can be
*        centred anywhere within the image, the location of the centre
*        is specified using parameters XCENTRE and YCENTRE.  The
*        extent of the PSF actually used is controlled by parameter
*        THRESH.
*     PSFTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        PSFTYPE determines if the Point Spread Function used in the
*        deconvolution is to be Gaussian (if PSFTYPE = "Gaussian"), or
*        is to be defined by an image that you supply (if PSFTYPE
*        = "NDF").  ["NDF"]
*     RATE = _REAL (Read)
*        This is the value to use for the MEMSYS3 RATE parameter.  It
*        determines the rate at which the convergence is allowed to
*        proceed.  If RATE is high, each maximum-entropy iteration is
*        allowed to make a big change to the current reconstruction.
*        This can cause numeric problems within MEMSYS3 resulting in
*        MEM2D crashing with a "floating overflow" error.  If this
*        happens, try reducing RATE.  Useful values will normally be of
*        the order of unity, and must lie in the interval 0.0001 to
*        100.  [0.5]
*     SUM = _REAL (Write)
*        This is an output parameter to which is written the
*        integrated-flux value calculated if an analysis is performed
*        (see parameter ANALYSE).
*     THRESH = _REAL (Read)
*        The fraction of the PSF peak amplitude at which the extents of
*        the NDF PSF are determined.  It must be positive and less than
*        0.5.  This parameter is only used when PSFTYPE = "NDF".  An
*        error will result if the input PSF is truncated above this
*        threshold. [0.0625]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A title for the output NDF.  A null (!) value means using the
*        title of the input NDF.  [!]
*     UPDATE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If UPDATE is given a TRUE value, then the output NDF will be
*        created after the first iteration, and will then be updated
*        after each subsequent iteration.  This means that the current
*        reconstruction can be examined without aborting the
*        application.  Also, if parameter EXTEND is TRUE, then if the
*        job aborts for any reason, it can be restarted from the last
*        completed iteration (see parameter IN). [TRUE]
*     XCENTRE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The x pixel index of the centre of the PSF within the supplied
*        PSF image.  This is only required if PSFTYPE is NDF.  XCENTRE
*        is defaulted to the middle pixel (rounded down if there are an
*        even number of pixels per line). []
*     YCENTRE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The y pixel index (line number) of the centre of the PSF
*        within the supplied PSF image.  This is only required if
*        PSFTYPE is NDF.  YCENTRE is defaulted to the middle line
*        (rounded down if there are an even number of lines). []

*  Examples:
*     mem2d m51 m51_hires psftype=gaussian fwhmpsf=3
*        This example deconvolves the data array in the NDF called m51,
*        putting the resulting image in the data array of the NDF called
*        m51_hires.  A circular Gaussian Point-Spread Function is used
*        with a Full Width at Half Maximum of 3 pixels.
*     mem2d m51 m51_hires psf=star xcentre=20 ycentre=20
*        This example performs the same function as the previous
*        example, but the PSF is defined by the data array of the NDF
*        called star, instead of being defined to be Gaussian.  This
*        allows the PSF to be any arbitrary 2-dimensional function.
*        NDF star could be produced for example, by the KAPPA
*        application called PSF.  Parameters XCENTRE and YCENTRE give
*        the pixel indices of the centre of the beam defined by the PSF
*        in star.  The PSF is truncated to one sixteenth of its peak
*        amplitude.
*     mem2d m51_hires m51_hires niter=70 psf=star
*        If the previous example failed to converge within the default
*        50 iterations, the deconvolution can be started again from
*        its current state, rather than having to start again from
*        scratch.  Here NITER gives the upper limit on the total number
*        of iterations which can be performed (including those performed
*        in the previous run of MEM2D), NOT just the number performed in
*        this single run of MEM2D.  This facility can also be used if a
*        MEM2D run is interrupted for any reason, such as the host
*        computer going down, or a batch-queue CPU limit being reached.
*        To use this facility the parameters EXTEND and UPDATE should
*        have the default values of TRUE.
*     mem2d m51_hires mask=nucleus
*        Once a deconvolved image has been produced, the significance
*        of features seen in the deconvolution can be assessed.  This
*        example takes in the NDF m51_hires produced by a previous run
*        of MEM2D.  If this is a completed deconvolution then the
*        parameter ANALYSE will be defaulted to TRUE, and an analysis
*        will be performed.  This effectively results in the
*        deconvolution being multiplied by the data array of the NDF
*        called nucleus, and the total data sum in the resulting image
*        being displayed, together with the standard deviation on the
*        total data sum.  The image in m51_hires is the most probable
*        deconvolution, but there may be other deconvolutions only
*        slightly less probable than m51_hires.  The standard deviation
*        produced by an analysis takes account of the spread between
*        such deconvolutions.  If the total data sum is not
*        significantly greater than the standard deviation, then the
*        feature selected by the mask image (called nucleus in this
*        case) may well be spurious.  The mask image itself may for
*        instance consist of an area of uniform value +1 covering some
*        feature of interest, and the bad value (or equivalently the
*        value zero) everywhere else.  The analysis would then give the
*        integrated flux in the feature, assuming that the background
*        is known to be zero.  If the background is not zero, then the
*        mask may contain a background region containing the value -1,
*        of equal area to the region containing the value +1.  The
*        resulting integrated flux would then be the total flux in the
*        source minus the flux in a background region of equal area.

*     KAPPA: FOURIER, LUCY, WIENER.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     VARIANCE, LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS and HISTORY components of an NDF
*     data structure and propagates all extensions.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported, though only to remove them by the DEF value.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  Arithmetic is
*     performed using single-precision floating point.

*  Notes:
*     -  MEM2D requires a large quantity of memory--- almost as much as
*     the rest of KAPPA.  In order for the KAPPA monolith to load
*     without you having to increase your memory or datasize resources,
*     and because MEM2D is batch oriented (see Timing) it is only
*     available as a separate application.
*     -  Memory is required to store several intermediate images while
*     the deconvolution is in progress.  If the input image is small
*     enough, these images are stored in a statically declared, internal
*     array.  Otherwise, they are stored in dynamically mapped external
*     arrays.  There is no limit on the size of image which can be
*     processed by MEM2D (other than those imposed by limited resources
*     on the host computer).
*     -  It is sometimes desirable for the pixels in the output image
*     to be smaller than those in the input image.  For instance, if
*     the input data are critically sampled (two samples per PSF), the
*     output image may not be a very good deconvolution.  In such cases
*     sub-dividing the output pixels would give better results.  At the
*     moment MEM2D cannot do this.  Be warned that sub-dividing the
*     input pixels and then running the current version of MEM2D will
*     not have the same effect, since the noise in the input image will
*     then have pixel-to-pixel correlations, and be interpreted as real
*     structure.

*  Timing:
*     MEM deconvolution is extremely CPU intensive.  The total CPU time
*     taken depends partly on the size of the image, and partly on the
*     complexity of the structure within the image.  As a typical
*     example, a 100x100 image containing 20 Gaussians on a flat
*     background took about 34 minutes of elapsed time on an unloaded
*     DEC Alpha 2000.  Deconvolution jobs should therefore always be
*     done in batch.  To perform an analysis on a deconvolution takes
*     about the same length of time as a single deconvolution
*     iteration.
