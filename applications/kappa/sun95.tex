% SST definitions
% ---------------

% +
%  Name:
%     SST.TEX

%  Purpose:
%     Define LaTeX commands for laying out Starlink routine descriptions.

%  Language:
%     LaTeX

%  Type of Module:
%     LaTeX data file.

%  Description:
%     This file defines LaTeX commands which allow routine documentation
%     produced by the SST application PROLAT to be processed by LaTeX and
%     by LaTeX2html. The contents of this file should be included in the
%     source prior to any statements that make of the sst commands.

%  Notes:
%     The commands defined in the style file html.sty provided with LaTeX2html 
%     are used. These should either be made available by using the appropriate
%     sun.tex (with hypertext extensions) or by putting the file html.sty 
%     on your TEXINPUTS path (and including the name as part of the  
%     documentstyle declaration).

%  Authors:
%     RFWS: R.F. Warren-Smith (STARLINK)
%     PDRAPER: P.W. Draper (Starlink - Durham University)
%     MJC: Malcolm J. Currie (STARLINK)

%  History:
%     10-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
%        Original version.
%     10-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
%        Added the implementation status section.
%     12-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
%        Added support for the usage section and adjusted various spacings.
%     8-DEC-1994 (PDRAPER):
%        Added support for simplified formatting using LaTeX2html.
%     1995 October 4 (MJC):
%        Added goodbreaks and pagebreak[3] in various places to improve
%        pages breaking before headings, not immediately after.
%        Corrected banner width.
%     2-DEC-1998 (DSB):
%        Added sstattributetype (copied from sun210.tex).

%    Starlink definitions for \LaTeX\ macros used in MAN output
%
%  Description:
%    As much as possible of the output from the MAN automatic manual generator
%    uses calls to user-alterable macros rather than direct calls to built-in
%    \LaTeX\ macros. This file is a version of the MAN default definitions for
%    these macros modified for Starlink preferences.
%
%  Language:
%    \LaTeX
%
%  Support:
%    William Lupton, {AAO}
%    Alan Chipperfield (RAL)
%-
%  History:
%    16-Nov-88 - WFL - Add definitions to permit hyphenation to work on
%		 words containing special characters and in teletype fonts.
%    27-Feb-89 - AJC - Redefine \manroutine
%                      Added \manheadstyle
%                      Switch order of argument descriptors
%    07-Mar-89 - AJC - Narrower box for parameter description
%                      Remove Intro section and other unused bits
%
% permit hyphenation when in teletype font (support 9,10,11,12 point only -
% could extend), define lccodes for special characters so that the hyphen-
% ation algorithm is not switched off. Define underscore character to be
% explicit underscore rather than lots of kerns etc.

%  Description:
%    There is a command to introduce a new routine (manroutine) and a list-like
%    environment (manroutinedescription) that handles the list of paragraphs
%    describing the current routine. In addition a manroutineitem command can
%    be used instead of the item command to introduce a new paragraph for the
%    current routine.
%
%    Two-column tables (the ones that can occur anywhere and which are
%    triggered by "=>" as the second token on a line) are bracketed by a
%    new environment (mantwocolumntable). Other sorts of table are introduced
%    by relevant  environments (manparametertable, manfunctiontable and
%    manvaluetable). The definitions of these environments call various other
%    user-alterable commands, thus allowing considerable user control over such
%    tables... (to be filled in when the commands have been written)

%   ==================
{\footnotesize KAPPA} is an applications package comprising about 180
general-purpose commands for image processing, data visualisation, and
manipulation of the standard Starlink data format---the NDF.  It is
intended to work in conjunction with Starlink's various specialised
packages.

In addition to the NDF, {\footnotesize KAPPA} can also process data in
other formats by using the `on-the-fly' conversion scheme.  Many
commands can process data arrays of arbitrary dimension, and others
work on both spectra and images.  {\footnotesize KAPPA} operates from
both the UNIX C-shell and the {\footnotesize ICL} command language.

This document describes how to use {\footnotesize KAPPA} and its
features.  There is some description of techniques too, including a
section on writing scripts.  This document includes several tutorials
and is illustrated with numerous examples.  The bulk of this document
comprises detailed descriptions of each command as well as classified
and alphabetical summaries.

\section{\xlabel{se_kappaintro}Introduction\label{se:kappaintro}}

\subsection{Background}
It is Starlink's aim to provide {\em maintainable\/}, {\em
portable\/}, and {\em extensible\/} applications packages that work in
harmony by sharing a common infrastructure toolkit, standards,
conventions and above all, a standard data format.  Individual
packages are no longer required to perform all functions, thus carry
less inertia, and are more adaptable to outside developments.
Additional functionality can be added piecemeal to the relevant
package.  New user interfaces, such as graphical, could be layered
within the toolkit for obtaining parameters and so make the
enhancement available to all applications that make use of those
tools.  An example of this approach has allowed us to access
`foreign data formats' throughout Starlink packages, because the
packages use a common infrastructure library.

An important part of the rationalisation is that applications are
unified by sharing the same basic data structure---the
\NDFref{NDF}\ (Extensible $N$-dimensional Data Format).  This contains
an $n$-dimensional data array that can store most astronomical data such
as spectra, images and spectral-line data cubes.  The NDF may also
contain information like a title, axis labels and units, error and
quality arrays, and WCS information.  There are also places in the NDF, called {\em
extensions}, to store any ancillary data associated with the data
array, even other NDFs.

\subsection{R\^{o}le of KAPPA}

The backbone of the applications packages is {\footnotesize KAPPA} ({\bf
K}ernel {\bf AP}plication {\bf PA}ckage).  It provides general-purpose
applications that have wide applicability, concentrating on image
processing, data visualisation, and manipulating
\xref{NDF}{sun33}{overview_of_an_ndf} components.  {\footnotesize KAPPA} provides
facilities that integrate with specialised Starlink packages such as
those for CCD reduction (\CCDPACKref ), stellar and galaxy photometry
(\PHOTOMref , \PISAref , \ESPref ), spectroscopy (\ECHOMOPref , \Figaroref ,
\TWODSPECref ), X-ray (\ASTERIXref ), graphics (\PONGOref ),
time-series polarimetry (\TSPref ), instrument-specific (\CGSDRref ,
\IRASref , \IRCAMPACKref , \JCMTDRref ) {\it etc.}  {\em Thus the
functionality of {\footnotesize KAPPA} should not be regarded in isolation.}

In a wider context, {\footnotesize KAPPA} offers facilities not in \IRAFref ,
for instance handling of data errors, quality masking, a graphics
database, availability from the shell, as well as more $n$-dimensional
applications, widespread use of data axes, and a different style. It
integrates with instrument packages developed at UK observatories.
With the automatic data conversion and the availability of {\footnotesize
KAPPA} and other Starlink packages from within the
{\footnotesize IRAF} command language, you should be able to pick the
best of the relevant tools from both systems to get the job done.

\subsection{Functionality of KAPPA}

\subsubsection{Applications}
Currently, {\footnotesize KAPPA} has about 180 commands that are available
both from the UNIX C-shell and from the \ICLref\ command language.
They provide the following facilities for data processing:

\begin{itemize}
\item \htmlref{FITS readers}{se:fitsreaders} that generate NDFs and
text tables, and the import and export of ancillary data through the
NDF \htmlref{FITS extension}{se:fitsairlock};
\item \htmlref{generation of test data}{cl:datagen}, and
\htmlref{NDF creation from text files}{TRANDAT};
\item setting and examining \htmlref{NDF components}{ap:NDFformat};
\item definition or \htmlref{calculation of a sky co-ordinate
system}{SETSKY};
\item arithmetic including a \htmlref{powerful application}{MATHS}
that handles expressions;
\item \htmlref{pixel and region editing}{cl:pixedit}, including polygons and
circles; re-flagging of bad pixels by value or by \htmlref{median
filtering}{GLITCH}; and \htmlref{pasting arrays over others}{PASTE};
\item \htmlref{masking}{se:masking} of regions, and of \htmlref{pixels
whose variances are too large}{ERRCLIP};
\item configuration change: \htmlref{flip}{FLIP},
\htmlref{rotate}{ROTATE}, \htmlref{shift}{SLIDE},
\htmlref{reshape}{RESHAPE}, subset, change
dimensionality;
\item normalisation of NDF pairs;
\item \htmlref{compression and expansion of images}{cl:compexp};
\item \htmlref{generalised resampling}{cl:resample} of NDFs using
arbitrary transformations;
\item filtering: \htmlref{box}{BLOCK}, \htmlref{Gaussian}{GAUSMOOTH},
and \htmlref{median smoothing}{MEDIAN}; very efficient
\htmlref{Fourier transform}{FOURIER}, \htmlref{convolution}{CONVOLVE};
\item deconvolution: \htmlref{maximum-entropy}{MEM2D},
\htmlref{Lucy-Richardson}{LUCY}, \htmlref{Wiener filter}{WIENER};
\item \htmlref{two-dimensional-surface fitting}{cl:surfit};
\item statistics including \htmlref{ordered statistics}{HISTAT},
\htmlref{histogram}{HISTOGRAM}; \htmlref{pixel-by-pixel
statistics over a sequence of images}{MSTATS};
\item inspection of image values;
\item \htmlref{centroids of features}{CENTROID}, particularly stars;
\htmlref{stellar PSF fitting}{PSF};
\item detail enhancement using \htmlref{histogram equalisation}{HISTEQ}
and \htmlref{Laplacian}{LAPLACE}, convolution, edge enhancement via a
\htmlref{shadow effect}{SHADOW}, \htmlref{thresholding}{THRESH};
\item \htmlref{calculation of polarimetry images}{CALPOL};
\item \htmlref{creation of 1-dimensional profiles through n-dimensional
data sets}{PROFILE};
\end{itemize}

There are also many applications for data visualisation:
\begin{itemize}
\item use of the \htmlref{graphics database}{se:agitate}, AGI, to pass
information about pictures between tasks; tools for the creation, labelling,
selection of pictures, and obtaining co-ordinate information from them;
\item \htmlref{image}{DISPLAY} plots with
a selection of scaling modes and many options such as axes;
\item creation, selection, saving and manipulation of \htmlref{colour
tables and palettes}{se:coltab} (for axes, annotation, coloured markers
and borders);
\item line graphics: \htmlref{contouring}{CONTOUR}; histogram; \htmlref{line
plots}{LINPLOT} of 1-dimensional arrays, and \htmlref{multiple-line
plot}{MLINPLOT} of images; \htmlref{pie sections}{ELPROF}, and slices
through an image; \htmlref{vector plot}{VECPLOT} of image; all of
which offer control of the appearance of plots.
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{General}
{\footnotesize KAPPA} handles \htmlref{bad pixels, and processes
quality}{se:masking}, variance, World Co-ordinate System (WCS), and other 
information stored within
NDFs \latexonly{(SUN/33 and Section~\ref{se:datastr})}.  In order to
achieve generality {\footnotesize KAPPA} does not process non-standard
extensions; however, it does not lose non-standard ancillary data
since it copies extensions to any NDFs that it creates.

{\footnotesize KAPPA} can also process data in other formats, such as FITS
and {\footnotesize IRAF}, using an automatic-data conversion facility
(SUN/55, SSN/20).  

Although oriented to image processing, many commands will work on NDFs
of arbitrary dimension and others operate on both spectra and images.
Many applications handle all non-complex data types directly, for
efficient memory and disc usage.  Those that do not will usually
undergo automatic data conversion to produce the desired result.

{\footnotesize KAPPA}'s graphics are device independent.  X-windows is 
supported.

\subsection{This document}
This document is arranged as follows.  First are two annotated {\footnotesize
KAPPA} tutorials to give you a quick summary of basic usage.  The main
text follows, which amplifies the points sketched in the demonstrations,
and describes other functionality and modes of use illustrated with
further examples.  Finally, there are extensive appendices, including a
classified list of commands and detailed descriptions of each command,
which are also available on a quick-reference card.


\newpage
\section{\xlabel{se_demo}Tutorials\label{se:demo}}

So the facilities summarised in the introduction sound appealing.  Now
you want to know how to access them, but the thick manual looks
daunting.  Actually, most of this manual comprises descriptions of each
application.  The best way to learn the basics is to try some example
sessions.

Login to a colour workstation or X-terminal.  Then enter the commands
following the prompts shown below.  The {\tt \%} is the shell prompt
string, which you don't type.  As we go along there will be
commentary explaining what is happening and why.  Let's begin. 

\subsection{From the C-shell}

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % kappa
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This defines C-shell aliases for each {\footnotesize KAPPA} command,
includes the help information, and shows the version number.  It need
only be issued once per login session.  Thus you will see

\small
\begin{verbatim}
      KAPPA commands are now available -- (Version 1.0)
 
      Type kaphelp for help on KAPPA commands
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Let's run a {\footnotesize KAPPA} application.  \htmlref{CADD}{CADD} adds a
scalar constant to an \NDFref{NDF} file---the Starlink standard data
format---to make a new NDF file (usually called an {\em NDF\/} for
short).  In this case ten is added to the pixels in {\tt
\$KAPPA\_DIR/comwest.sdf} to create {\tt test.sdf} in the current
directory.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % cadd $KAPPA_DIR/comwest 10 test
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

There are three \htmlref{{\em parameters\/}}{se:param} qualifying
the CADD command: the names of the input and output NDFs and the
constant.  Notice that these parameters are separated by spaces.  Most
applications have a few of these positional parameters, usually the
most commonly used.  Parameters given on the command line are not
subsequently prompted for by the application.  Also you see that the
NDF file extensions are not given. The {\tt .sdf} extension indicates
that it was created by the \xref{Hierarchical Data System}{sun92}{}
\latexonly{ (SUN/92)}, or HDS for short.  Note that an arbitrary
{\tt .sdf} file is not necessarily an NDF.

Next we run the statistics task.  Here we have not given any parameters.
In this case the application will ask for the values of any parameters
it needs.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % stats
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The only parameter required is called NDF, and \htmlref{STATS}{STATS}
prompts us for it.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     NDF - Data structure to analyse /@test/ >
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

In this example, STATS wants to know for which NDF we require
statistical data.  The text between the {\tt //} delimiters is the
suggested default for the parameter.  By pressing the carriage return we
accept this default as the parameter's value.  Here the suggested
default is the name of the NDF created by CADD.  (Ignore the {\tt @} for
the moment---it just tells the application that it is a file.) {\footnotesize
KAPPA} remembers the last NDF used or created, and uses it for the
suggested default to save typing.  Since {\tt test} is the NDF whose
statistics we want we just hit the return key.  Again we exclude the
{\tt .sdf} extension.  Here is the output from STATS.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
        Pixel statistics for the NDF structure /home/scratch/mjc/test

           Title                     : Comet West, low resolution
           NDF array analysed        : DATA

              Pixel sum              : 11851773
              Pixel mean             : 180.8437
              Standard deviation     : 63.47324
              Minimum pixel value    : 13.89063
                 At pixel            : (59, 83)
                 Co-ordinate         : (58.5, 82.5)
              Maximum pixel value    : 255.9375
                 At pixel            : (248, 45)
                 Co-ordinate         : (247.5, 44.5)
              Total number of pixels : 65536
              Number of pixels used  : 65536 (100.0%)

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Of course, in your case the current directory will not be {\tt
/home/scratch/mjc}.  The NDF title is the unchanged from the 
{\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/comwest} NDF.  This is the normal behaviour for tasks
that create a new NDF from an old one; they do, however, have a
parameter for changing this default.  To alter a defaulted parameter you
supply its new value on the command line.  Defaulted parameters exist to
prevent a long series of prompts where reasonable values can be defined,
and hence save time. (However, there is a way of being prompted for all
parameters of a command should you wish.)  

NDFs may contain three standard arrays---the data array, the data
variance and quality.  STATS can calculate statistics for any of
these.  By default, STATS uses the data array, as indicated here.

Next we wish to smooth our data.  \htmlref{GAUSMOOTH}{GAUSMOOTH}
performs a Gaussian smooth of neighbouring pixels.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % gausmooth
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Again we are prompted with the same suggested default, since we
have not created any new NDFs within STATS.  Say we don't want to
smooth that NDF, but the original one.  We just enter the name of the
NDF at the prompt.  Notice that we don't need the {\tt @}
prefix, since parameter IN expects a file.  (One occasion where you
would need it is when the filename is a number, {\it{e.g.}}\ if your
NDF was called 234 you must enter {\tt @234}, otherwise the parameter
system will think you are giving the integer 234.  Yes \ldots I 
know \ldots the parameter system is trying to be too clever.)

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     IN - Input NDF /@test/ > $KAPPA_DIR/comwest
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The description of parameter FWHM is too brief for us to select a value.
So we obtain some help on this parameter, and then GAUSMOOTH reprompts
for a value.  The smoothed NDF is written to the NDF called {\tt testsm}
in the current directory.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     FWHM - Gaussian PSF full-width at half-maximum /5/ > ?

     GAUSMOOTH

       Parameters

         FWHM

           FWHM() = _REAL (Read)
              This specifies whether a circular or elliptical Gaussian
              point-spread function is used in smoothing a 2-dimensional
              image.  If one value is given it is the full-width at
              half-maximum of a 1-dimensional or circular Gaussian PSF.
              (Indeed only one value is permitted for a 1-dimensional
              array.)  If two values are supplied, this parameter becomes the
              full-width at half-maximum of the major and minor axes of an
              elliptical Gaussian PSF.  Values between 0.1 and 100.0 pixels
              should be given.  Note that unless a non-default value is
              specified for the BOX parameter, the time taken to perform the
              smoothing will increase in approximate proportion to the
              value(s) of FWHM.  The suggested default is the current value.
              will increase in approximate proportion to the value of FWHM.
                                                           
     FWHM - Gaussian PSF full-width at half-maximum /5/ >
     OUT - Output NDF > testsm
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Next we want to look at the result of our image processing.  The first
thing to do is to select an graphics device.  The {\tt xwindows} device
becomes the current graphics device and remains so until the next
\htmlref{GDSET}{GDSET} command.  (You may need to enter the
{\tt xdisplay} command (\xref{SUN/129}{sun129}{}) to redirect
the output from the host computer to the screen in front you.)

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % gdset xwindows
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Now we actually display it on the screen.  Some applications have
many parameters, and it would be impractical to have to specify all
those preceding the ones we wanted to alter.  The solution is to specify
the parameter by keyword.  Here we have requested that the scaling of
the data values to colour indices within the graphics device uses the
current percentile range.  Note that you may abbreviate the options
of a menu, such as offered by parameter MODE, to any unambiguous
string.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % display mode=pe accept
     Data will be scaled from 78.38278 to 235.3536.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

If you have just created the window, the image will not look much like
the comet, because the existing colour table is poor.  If we replace
the table with a greyscale ramp from white to black,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % lutneg
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

what happens depends on your workstation hardware and settings. If your
graphics system is set to 256 colours (technically, an \emph{8-bit
pseudo-colour visual}), then the effects of the above LUTNEG command will
be immediately visible, and you will see a blurred image of the
ubiquitous Comet West on the screen. If, on the other hand, your graphics
system is set to 16 bit or 24 bit graphics, then the effects of the
LUTNEG command will only become visible when you next display an image.
In this case, re-invoking the above DISPLAY command will make the image
appear correctly with the requested grey scale colour table.


The \htmlref{ACCEPT keyword}{se:parspeckey} is a very useful feature.
It tells an application to accept all the suggested defaults.  In this
case \htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY} uses the current NDF and scales
between the current percentile limits---10 and 90.  The keyword can be
abbreviated to double backslash from the shell. Aside: the parameter
system actually requires a single backslash. From the shell, however,
backslash is a {\em metacharacter\/}, and so must be `escaped' to
treat the character literally.  One way is to place a {\tt
$\backslash$} before each metacharacter.  You can escape a series of
characters by placing them inside single quotes {\tt ' '}. Other
metacharacters to watch out for when using {\footnotesize KAPPA} include {\tt
[]()"}.

Next we want to make the image colourful.  There are a number of
predefined lookup tables, or you may create and modify your own.  Here
we've given the X-window a ``warm'' brown-yellow colour
table\footnote{Again, you will need to re-display the image to see the
effects of this command unless your graphics system is set to 256
colours.}:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % lutwarm
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

If you are not happy with this colour table, you may want to explore a
wider range of colour tables using the LUTEDIT command which provides a 
complete graphical user interface for manpulating and viewing colour
tables.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % lutedit image=$KAPPA_DIR/comwest
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{From ICL}
\ICLref\ is a command language designed for use with Starlink applications,
such as {\footnotesize KAPPA}. It is now of some antiquity but is still in
use. The main advantages for the {\footnotesize KAPPA} user are that
shell metacharacters like {\tt []()$\backslash$"} need not be escaped;
command names may be abbreviated; far fewer executables need be loaded,
and therefore it is slightly faster than using the shell when you want to
invoke more than a few commands on a busy system; there is a wide
selection of intrinsic functions and floating-point arithmetic; and
results may be passed between applications via {\footnotesize ICL}
variables.  However, in these two demonstrations the command languages
are interchangeable apart from the accept backslash.

Let's start the second example.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % icl
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This starts {\footnotesize ICL}.  System, local and user-defined {\footnotesize ICL}
login files are invoked.  Here there is only a system login procedure
which sets up help on Starlink packages, and commands for setting
up definitions for those packages.  One of those commands is {\tt
kappa}; it is analogous to the {\tt kappa} command from the shell.
We enter it after receiving the {\footnotesize ICL} prompt.

You should see something like the following.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    ICL (UNIX) Version 3.1-9 14/02/2000

    Loading installed package definitions...

       - Type HELP package_name for help on specific Starlink packages
       -   or HELP PACKAGES for a list of all Starlink packages
       - Type HELP [command] for help on ICL and its commands

     ICL> kappa
 
        KAPPA commands are now available (Version 1.0).
 
        Type `help kappa' or `kaphelp' for help on KAPPA commands.
 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Now we run an application, \htmlref{ADD}{ADD}, that adds the pixels in
{\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/comwest.sdf} to those in {\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/ccdframec.sdf}. 
Although these images have different
dimensions, the intersection is made.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> add $KAPPA_DIR/comwest $KAPPA_DIR/ccdframec
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

After the first {\footnotesize KAPPA} command is issued you'll see an arcane
message like this.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     Loading /star/bin/kappa/kappa_mon into kappa_mon11601 (attached)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

It just tells you that the {\footnotesize KAPPA} monolith is being loaded.
You'll see similar messages for each of the three monoliths when they
are first wanted.

Since we did not give the name of the destination
\xref{NDF}{sun33}{overview_of_an_ndf} that will hold the co-added NDFs,
ADD prompts for it.  Notice that literal parameters are case insensitive.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     OUT - Output NDF / / > demo1
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> ndftrace \

        NDF structure /home/soft2/mjc/alpha_OSF1/kappa/package/demo1:
           Title:  Comet West, low resolution

        Shape:
            No. of dimensions:  2
            Dimension size(s):  256 x 256
            Pixel bounds     :  1:256, 1:256
            Total pixels     :  65536

        Data Component:
            Type        :  _REAL
            Storage form:  PRIMITIVE
            Bad pixels may be present
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This shows that the {\tt demo1} NDF has the same dimensions as the
smaller of the two NDFs.

We were going to display the image on the current graphics device, but
then changed our minds.  A {\tt !!} in response to a prompt
\htmlref{aborts}{se:abortnull} a task.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> display demo1
     MODE - Method to define the scaling limits /'PERCENTILES'/ > !!
     !! SUBPAR: Abort (!!) response to prompt for parameter MODE
     OBEYW unexpected status returned from task "kapview_mon11601", action
     - "DISPLAY"
     ADAMERR  %PAR, Parameter request aborted
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

{\footnotesize KAPPA} uses the graphics database, which records the positions
and extents of graphs and images, collectively called pictures.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> picgrid 2 1
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This instruction divides the display surface into two equally sized
pictures, side by side.  They are labelled 1 and 2 in the database.
Picture 1 is the current picture, in which future pictures are drawn,
unless we select a new current picture.

Thus in picture 1 we display an image of Comet West around which we
draw annotated axes.  The backslash causes the current scaling method
to be used.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> display comwest axes \
     !! Error accessing file '/home/scratch/mjc/comwest.sdf' -
     !     No such file or directory
     !  HDS_OPEN: Error opening an HDS container file.
     !  NDF_ASSOC: Unable to associate an NDF structure with the '%IN' parameter.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY} could not find the a {\tt comwest.sdf} in
the current directory.  So there is an error message and we are
prompted.  This time we remember to add the environment variable.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     IN - NDF to be displayed /@comwest_bas/ > $KAPPA_DIR/comwest
     Data will be scaled from 67.46276 to 226.5568.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
An image of Comet West should be visible to the left of the screen.

SHADOW creates an image that appears like a bas-relief.  We've called
the resulting NDF comwest\_bas.  The backslash causes the current NDF
to be the input NDF for \htmlref{SHADOW}{SHADOW}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> shadow out=comwest_bas \
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We select the right-hand picture created earlier.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> picsel 2
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

As above we display the current NDF, the bas-relief image, with annotated
axes on the right of the raw comet image (we do not need to request the
axes explicitly this time, since the {\tt axes} parameter retains the
value used in the previous invocation until changed).

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> display border \
     Data will be scaled from -4.721756 to 5.697861.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The relief looks best with a greyscale colour table.  Note that this
does not affect the colour of the border.  \htmlref{LUTGREY}{LUTGREY}
is a procedure which calls a more-general application.  Since it is
the first procedure we've invoked there is a short pause while all the
{\footnotesize KAPPA} procedures are compiled and loaded.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> lutgrey
     Loading procedure file $KAPPA_DIR/kappa_proc.icl
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Next we decide to make a hard copy of the bas-relief image. 
\htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY} does this and can add a key of grey levels
and their corresponding values.  The chosen device is {\tt ps\_l};
this overrides the {\tt xwindows} device for the duration of DISPLAY. 
If this name isn't recognised at your site, issue the
\htmlref{GDNAMES}{GDNAMES} command for a list of your local device
names.  Select the landscape PostScript device.  We scale between
wider limits to reduce the glare.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> display key=yes device="/PS"
     IN - NDF to be displayed /@comwest_bas/ >
     MODE - Method to define the scaling limits /'SCALE'/ >
     LOW - Low value for display /187.5625/ > 11
     HIGH - High value for display /-183.453125/ > -8.33
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

DISPLAY does not send your plot to the printer, since this is hardware
and node dependent.  Therefore, you must issue a shell command
from {\footnotesize ICL} to perform this action.  That's not difficult---just
insert a {\tt !} before the UNIX command, and in most cases just issue
the command as if you were in the shell, like we do below.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> !lpr -P1 pgplot.ps
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Shell aliases may also be used, so if {\tt ri} equates to {\tt rm -i},
we could remove any unwanted \xref{HDS}{sun92}{} files.  If you don't
have this symbol, as is likely, then you will receive the appropriate
error message from {\footnotesize ICL}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> ri *.sdf
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

That's the end of the second demonstration.  Of course, these
introductions have only scratched the surface of what {\footnotesize KAPPA} can
do for you.  You should look at 
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:classified}}{the
\htmlref{classified lists}{ap:classified}} to search for the desired
function, and then find more details in
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:full}.}{the \htmlref{specifications}{ap:full}.}

If you get stuck or something untoward happens, there is a {\tt Hints}
help topic.

\newpage
\section{Getting started}

\subsection{Running KAPPA}
{\footnotesize KAPPA} runs from the C-shell and variants, and also from the
interactive command language---\ICLref\@.  Both run
monolithic programmes for efficiency.  Both have their advantages and
disadvantages.  Of the latter, the shell forces you to escape certain
characters, and {\footnotesize ICL} does not have a {\tt foreach} to loop
through a wildcarded list of NDFs. You may simply prefer the familiar
shell to {\footnotesize ICL}, though UNIX commands, including editing, are
accessible from {\footnotesize ICL} via a {\tt !} prefix.  This is not the
soapbox to expound the intrinsic merits of the two command languages,
but where there are differences affecting {\footnotesize KAPPA}, they'll be
indicated.  The choice is yours.

To run {\footnotesize KAPPA} from the shell just enter the following command.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % kappa
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This executes a procedure setting up aliases for {\footnotesize KAPPA}'s
command names and to make help information available.  Then you'll be
able to mix {\footnotesize KAPPA} commands with the familiar shell ones. 

If the {\tt kappa} command is not recognised, you probably haven't
enabled the Starlink software.  In your {\tt .cshrc} or {\tt .tcshrc}
file, you insert the line

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     source /star/etc/cshrc
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and in {\tt .login} you include the equivalent line

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     source /star/etc/login
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
At non-Starlink sites the {\tt /star} path may be different.

To run {\footnotesize KAPPA} from {\footnotesize ICL} you have to start up the
command language if you are not already using it.  This requires just
one extra command, namely

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % icl
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
You will see any messages produced by system and user procedures, followed
by the {\tt ICL>} prompt.  Again there is a procedure for making the
commands known to the command language, and not unexpectedly, it too is

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> kappa
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Then you are ready to go.  Not too painful, was it?  In either case
you'll see message from {\footnotesize KAPPA} telling you which version is
ready for use.

So what do you get for your trouble?  Appendix~\ref{ap:summary} lists
in alphabetical order all the commands and their functions, and
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:classified}}{there}
is a \htmlref{classified list}{ap:classified} of the same commands.
Many examples are given in subsequent sections.

\subsection{Issuing Commands}
To run an application you then can just give its name---you will be
prompted for any required parameters.  Alternatively, you may enter
parameter values on the command line specified by position or by
keyword.  More on this in
\latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:param}.}{\htmlref{Parameters}{se:param}}

Commands are interpreted in a case-independent way from \ICLref , but
from the shell they must be given in lowercase.  In {\footnotesize ICL},
commands may also be abbreviated provided they are unambiguous strings
with at least four characters.  Commands shorter than five characters,
therefore, cannot be shortened. So

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> CREF
     ICL> crefr
     ICL> CreFra
     ICL> CREFRAM
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would all run CREFRAME. Whereas

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> FITS
     ICL> FITSI
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would be ambiguous, since there are several commands beginning
{\tt FITS}, and two starting {\tt FITSI}, namely FITSIN and FITSIMP.

Note if other packages are active there is the small possibility of a
command-name clash.  Issuing such a
command will run that command in the package last activated.  You can
ensure running the {\footnotesize KAPPA} command by inserting a {\tt kap\_}
prefix before the command name.  For example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
      % kap_rotate
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
will execute {\footnotesize KAPPA}'s ROTATE application.  There may also be a
clash with UNIX commands and shell built-in functions, though there are
now far fewer conflicts than in earlier versions of {\footnotesize KAPPA}, with
only {\bf look} being ambiguous.  There is also a {\bf glob} in the
C-shell which might confuse you should you forget that
\htmlref{GLOBALS}{GLOBALS} cannot be abbreviated from the shell.

\medskip

{\large {\bf Since the {\normalsize{\bf KAPPA}} commands are the same
in both the shell and {\normalsize{\bf ICL}}, the {\tt \%} and {\tt
ICL>} prompts in the examples and description
\latexelsehtml{below}{in subsequent pages} are
interchangeable unless noted otherwise.}}

\subsection{\xlabel{se_kaphelp}Obtaining Help\label{se:kaphelp}}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_hypertext}Hypertext Help\label{se:hypertext}}

A modified version of this document exists in hypertext form.  One way
to access it is to use the
\xref{{\tt showme}}{sun188}{displaying_parts_of_documents} command

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % showme sun95
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and a Web browser will appear, presenting the index to the hypertext
form of this document.  The hypertext permits easy location of
referenced documents and applications.  It also includes colour
illustrations.

The \xref{{\tt findme}}{sun188}{performing_keyword_searches}
command lets you search the Starlink documents by
keywords.  For instance,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % findme masking
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
searches the document looking for the word ``masking'' in
them.  The level of searching depends on whether a match is found.
The search starts with the document title, the page (section)
titles, and finally the document text.  The deeper the search,
the longer it will take.  There are switches provided to limit the
level of the search.  The search string may include {\bf sed} or 
{\bf grep} regular expressions.  See \xref{SUN/188}{sun188}{}
or enter

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % findme findme
     % findme showme 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
to learn more about the {\tt findme} and {\tt showme} commands.

\subsubsection{Entering the Help System}
To access the KAPPA help use \htmlref{KAPHELP}{KAPHELP}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> kaphelp
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The system responds by introducing {\footnotesize KAPPA}'s help library,
followed by a long list of topics for which help is available,
followed by the prompt {\tt Topic?}. These topics are mostly the
commands for running applications, but they also include global
information on matters such as parameters, data structures and
selecting a graphics device.

From \ICLref\ you can issue other commands for
obtaining help about {\footnotesize KAPPA}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> help kappa
     ICL> help packages
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The former is nearly equivalent to entering {\tt kaphelp}.  However,
it is less easy to use as it lacks many of the navigational aids of
KAPHELP.  The latter gives a summary of Starlink packages available
from {\footnotesize ICL}.  If you select the {\tt KAPPA} subtopic, you'll get
a precis of the package's facilities. (This is part of an index of
Starlink packages.)

If you have commenced running an application you can still access the
help library whenever you are prompted for a parameter.  See
\latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:parhelp}}{\htmlref{Entering the Help 
System}{se:parhelp}} for details.

\subsubsection{Navigating Help Hierarchies} 

The help information is arranged hierarchically.  The help system
enables you to navigate the library by prompting when it has either
presented a screen's worth of text or has completed displaying the
previously requested help.  The information displayed by the help
system on a particular topic includes a description of the topic and
a list of subtopics that further describe the topic.

You can select a new topic by entering its name or an unambiguous
abbreviation.  If you press the carriage-return key ({\tt{<CR>}}) you
will either continue reading a topic where there is further text to
show, or move up one level in the hierarchy.  Entering a {\tt CTRL/D}
(pressing D whilst holding the CTRL key) terminates the help session.
See the description of \htmlref{KAPHELP}{KAPHELP} for a full
list of the options available at prompts inside the help system, and
the rules for wildcarding and abbreviating topics.

\subsubsection{Help on KAPPA commands}
Help on an individual {\footnotesize KAPPA} application is simply achieved by
entering {\tt kaphelp} followed by the command name, for example

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % kaphelp centroid
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
will give the description and usage of the CENTROID command.  There
are subtopics which contain details of the parameters, including
defaults, and valid ranges; examples; notes expanding on the
description; implementation status; and occasionally timing. For
example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> kaphelp hist param ndf
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
gives details of parameter {\tt NDF} in all applications prefixed by
{\tt HIST}.

(From {\footnotesize ICL} you can also invoke its help system, thus
\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> help centroid
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
is similar to {\tt kaphelp centroid}, though the {\footnotesize ICL} system has
drawbacks, and you are recommended to run KAPHELP.)

The instruction

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> kaphelp classified
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
displays a list of subject areas as subtopics.  Each subtopic lists and
gives the function of each {\footnotesize KAPPA} application in that
classification.  There is also an alphabetic list which can be obtained
directly via the command

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> kaphelp summary
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{Changing the Current Directory in ICL}
You should change default directories in \ICLref\ using its
DEFAULT command, and not {\bf cd}.  Thus

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> default /home/scratch/dro
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
makes {\tt /home/scratch/dro} the default directory for the {\footnotesize ICL}
session, and for existing and future subprocesses, including
application packages.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_exiting}Exiting an Application\label{se:exiting}}

In normal circumstances when you've finished using {\footnotesize KAPPA}
nothing need be done from the shell, but to end an \ICLref\ session,
enter the {\tt EXIT} command to return to the shell.

What if you've done something wrong, like entering the wrong value for a
parameter?  If there are further prompts you can enter the abort code
{\tt !!} to exit the application.  This is recommended even from the
shell because certain files like your NDFs may
become corrupted if you use a crude {\tt CTRL/C}.  If, however,
processing of the data has begun in the application, it is probably best
to let the task complete, unless it is a long job like image
deconvolution.  If you really must abort, {\tt CTRL/C} should be hit.
From \ICLref\ this ought to return you to a prompt, but the
processing will continue.  Then you can stop the running process by
`killing' it.  First find the task name

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> tasks
                           TASKNAME  Process Id

                   ndfpack_mon16528  15186
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

and then kill it.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> kill ndfpack_mon16528
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This removes a the {\footnotesize NDFPACK} monolith.  {\footnotesize NDFPACK} will be
loaded again once you enter one its commands.  If pressing {\tt CTRL/C}
several times fails to return you to an {\footnotesize ICL} prompt then
it's time for the heavy artillery---you may have to kill your window.
Once back to the shell enter {\tt icl} to return to {\footnotesize ICL}, and
then kill the process as described above.

If you have interrupted a task, it may be necessary to delete the
\htmlref{parameter file}{se:defaults} \latexonly{(Section~\ref{se:defaults})} and
the \htmlref{graphics database}{se:agitidy}
\latexonly{ (Section~\ref{se:agitidy})}.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{se_param}Parameters\label{se:param}}

{\footnotesize KAPPA} is a command-driven package.  Commands have
{\em parameters\/} by which you can qualify their behaviour.
Parameters are obtained in response to prompts or supplied on a
command line.

For convenience, the main aspects of the parameter system
as seen by a user of {\footnotesize KAPPA} are described below, but note
that most of what follows is applicable to any Starlink
application.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_parsummary}Summary\label{se:parsummary}}

For your convenience, here is a summary of how to use parameters.
If you want more information, go to the appropriate section.

\begin{description}

\item Command-line values \newline
 On the command line you can supply values by keyword or by position.
 See \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:cmdlindef}}{\htmlref{Specifying Parameter
 Values on Command Lines}{se:cmdlindef}} for more details including abbreviated
 keywords.

\item {\tt ACCEPT, PROMPT, RESET} command-line special keywords \newline
 {\tt ACCEPT} accepts all the suggested defaults that would otherwise
 be prompted.  {\tt PROMPT} prompts for all the parameters not given on
 the command line, and {\tt RESET} resets all the suggested defaults to
 their initial values.  You can find more details and examples in
 \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:parspeckey}.}{\htmlref{Special Keywords: ACCEPT,
 PROMPT, RESET}{se:parspeckey}.}

\item {\tt NAME - Prompt string /Suggested default/ $>$} \newline
 This is a schematic of a prompt.  NAME is the parameter's name.
 You normally respond with the value for the parameter, but there are
 special responses available (see below).
 If you just hit the return key, the suggested default becomes the
 parameter value.  Many parameters are defaulted without prompting.  See 
 \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:defaults} and
 Section~\ref{se:parglobals}}{\htmlref{Defaults}{se:defaults} and
 \htmlref{Globals}{se:parglobals}} for more details.
\end{description}

Here is a list of some example parameter values to illustrate the
possible ways you can respond to a prompt.  Where there are command-line
differences, they are noted.

\begin{description}

\item {\tt 5409.12} \newline
 This is a scalar.  Numerical values can be integer, real, or double precision.

\item {\tt 12,34,56,78} \newline
 This is a vector.  They must be enclosed in {\tt [~]} if the array
 is supplied on the command line, or for character arrays.

\item {\tt [[11,21,31],[12,22,32]]} \newline
 This is a 3$\times$2 array.  Arrays of dimension $>$ 2 should
 appear in nested brackets.  See
 \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:pararrays}}{\htmlref{Arrays}{se:pararrays}}
 for more about array values. 

\item {\tt T} \newline
\vspace{-5ex}
\item {\tt no} \newline
 This is a {\tt TRUE} value followed by a {\tt FALSE} values for
 logical parameters.  Acceptable values are {\tt TRUE}, {\tt FALSE},
 {\tt YES}, {\tt NO}, {\tt T}, {\tt F},  {\tt Y}, {\tt N} and their
 lowercase equivalents.  On the command line,
 the parameter name as a keyword means {\tt TRUE}.  If the name is
 prefixed with {\tt NO}, the value is set to {\tt FALSE}.

\item {\tt a string} \newline
\vspace{-5ex}
\item {\tt "a string"} \newline
 This is a string.  Strings need not be quoted at prompts.  Quotes are
 required on the command line if the string includes spaces or
 wildcards, or is a comma-separated array of strings.  There is more in
 \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:parstrings}.}{\htmlref{Strings}{se:parstrings}.}
 Some parameters offer a selection from a menu to which you give
 an unambiguous abbreviation to select an option.  Other parameters
 can be numerical or a string.  (See
 \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:parmenu}}{\htmlref{Menus}{se:parmenu}}
 for more information.)

\item {\tt filename} \newline
\vspace{-5ex}
\item {\tt @123} \newline
 This enters a filename (or tape drive).  You give a text filename
 verbatim, and NDFs without the file extension.  Foreign formats will
 usually have the file extension. Should the filename be a numerical
 value, it must be preceded by an {\tt @}.  There is more in
 \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:parstrings}.}{\htmlref{Strings}{se:parstrings}.}

\item {\tt min} \newline
\vspace{-5ex}
\item {\tt max} \newline
 This selects the minimum- or maximum-allowed value, but not all
 parameters have a defined range of permitted values.  See
 \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:parminmax}.}{\htmlref{MIN and MAX
 parameter values}{se:parminmax}.}

\item {\tt !} \newline
 Enters the null value.  This has a variety of special meanings; which
 one will depend on the particular parameter.  For example, null might
 indicate that an output file is not to be created, or a loop is to be
 ended.  There are more examples in
 \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:abortnull}.}{\htmlref{Abort and
 Null}{se:abortnull}.}

\item {\tt !!} \newline
 This aborts the application cleanly.

\item {\tt ?} \newline
\vspace{-5ex}
\item {\tt ??} \newline
 A single question mark presents the online help for the parameter,
 and then reprompts.  A double question mark leaves you in the help
 system to explore other help information.  See
 \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:parhelp}}{\htmlref{Help}{se:parhelp}}
 for examples.  These special values are not supported from the
 command line.

\item \verb+\+ \newline
 This accepts the suggested default for the prompted parameter and the
 respective suggested defaults for all subsequent parameters for which
 prompting would otherwise occur.  On the command line \verb+\+
 is an abbreviation of the {\tt ACCEPT} keyword, and it
 applies to all parameters that would otherwise be prompted.  Note that
 from the shell you write \verb+\\+, as \verb+\+ is a
 shell metacharacter.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_defaults}Defaults\label{se:defaults}}

Command-line values are used mostly for those parameters that are
normally defaulted by the application.  Defaulted parameters enable
applications to have many options, say for controlling the appearance of
some graphical output, without making routine operations tedious because
of a large number of prompts.  The values of normally defaulted
parameters are given in 
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:full}.}{the \htmlref{application
specifications}{ap:full}.}
You can also find them by obtaining online help on a specific
parameter.  They are enclosed in square brackets at the end of the
parameter description.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> kaphelp median param *
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
gives details of all parameters in application
\htmlref{MEDIAN}{MEDIAN}.  Other packages have similar help
commands. If you want to override one of these defaults,
then you must specify the parameter's value on the command line.

When you are prompted you will usually be given a suggested default
value in {\tt / /} delimiters.  You can choose to accept the default by
pressing carriage return.  For example, {\tt 64} is the suggested value
below.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     XDIM - x dimension of output array /64/ >
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Alternatively, enter a different value

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     XDIM - x dimension of output array /64/ > 109
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
to override the default.
Some defaults begin with an {\tt @}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     IN - Input image /@starfield/ >
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
These are associated with files (text and \HDSref ) and devices (graphics
and tape).  If you want to override the default given, you do not have
to prefix your value with an {\tt @}, {\it{e.g.}}

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     DEVICE - Name of display device /@xwindows/ > x2w
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
There are rare cases when the syntax is ambiguous, and it is then that you
need to include the {\tt @}.
\latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:parstrings}}{\htmlref{Strings}{se:parstrings}}
describes when the {\tt @} is needed.

From both \ICLref\ and the shell the default value can be edited to save 
typing by first pressing the {\tt <TAB>} key.  The editor behaves like the 
shell command-line editor.

Defaults may change as data are processed.  Often the current (last)
value of the parameter will be substituted, or a dynamic value is
suggested depending on the values of other parameters.  Here is an
example comprising a loop within an application.

\small
\begin{verbatim}

     NDF - NDF to examine /@horsehead > 
     CENTRE - Position at the centre of the listing /'64 64'/ > 100 120
        .              .               .              .
        .              .               .              .
        .              .               .              .
     CENTRE - Position at the centre of the listing /'100 120'/ >
     SIZE - The dimensions (in pixels) of the area to be listed /7/ > 
        .              .               .              .
        .              .               .              .
        .              .               .              .

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and so on.  Notice that the current values of the centres are the
suggested values at the second prompt.

Current values of parameters are stored in a {\em parameter file}, and
so they persist between sessions.  For tasks run from the shell, this
is an HDS file {\tt \$ADAM\_USER/}{\it $<$application$>$}{\tt .sdf},
where {\it $<$application$>$} is the name of the application. (If the
environment variable {\tt \$ADAM\_USER} is not defined the parameter
file is situated in {\tt \$HOME/adam}).

Unfortunately, tasks invoked from \ICLref\ use a monolith parameter
file, which contains the individual application parameter files for
the members.  So for example, {\footnotesize KAPPA} has {\tt kappa\_mon.sdf},
{\tt kapview\_mon.sdf}, and {\tt ndfpack\_mon.sdf} stored in the same
directory as the individual files.  This duality means that there are
two independent sets of current values for each task depending on
where you ran it from.

The parameter file should not be deleted unless the parameters
values are to be completely reset, or the file has been corrupted in
some way.  If you suspect the latter case, say after \htmlref{interrupting
a task}\latexonly{ (Section~\ref{se:exiting})}, run
\HDSTRACEref\ \latexonly{(SUN/102)} on the file to check its integrity.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_parglobals}Globals\label{se:parglobals}}

{\footnotesize KAPPA} stores a number of global parameters that are used
as defaults to reduce typing in response to prompts.  Global means that
they are shared between applications.  The most common is the last
dataset (usually NDF) written or accessed.  In the example above, this
was {\tt horsehead.sdf}.  If you just press {\tt <CR>} in response to the
prompt, the global value is unchanged.  Only when you modify the
parameter and the application completes without error is the global value
updated.

All global parameters are stored in the HDS file {\tt
\$ADAM\_USER/GLOBAL.sdf}, or {\tt \$HOME/adam/GLOBAL.sdf} if the {\tt
\$ADAM\_USER} environment variable is not defined.  The full list is
given below.
\newline
\newline
\begin{tabular}{@{\hspace{5ex}}l@{~~ --- ~~}l}
{\tt GLOBAL.DATA\_ARRAY}      & Last NDF or foreign data file accessed or written.\\
{\tt GLOBAL.GRAPHICS\_DEVICE} & Current graphics workstation.\\
{\tt GLOBAL.INTERACTIONMODE}  & Current interaction mode. \\
{\tt GLOBAL.LUT} & Last lookup table file accessed or written. \\
{\tt GLOBAL.TRANSFORM} & Current transformation structure. \\
\end{tabular}

{\footnotesize KAPPA} uses the last DATA\_ARRAY written or accessed as
the suggested default value for the next prompt for an NDF structure
or foreign data format.  The same applies to the current lookup table
and transformation structure.  However, the remaining, including the
graphics global parameter are defaulted---you will not be
prompted.  Details of how to control these parameters are given in the
relevant sections.

The values of all global parameters may be inspected with the
\htmlref{GLOBALS}{GLOBALS} task.  You can make them undefined using
\htmlref{NOGLOBALS}{NOGLOBALS}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> globals
     The current data file                : @/home/dro/jkt/ccdpic
     The current graphics device is       : @ps_l
     The current lookup table file is     : @$KAPPA_DIR/spectrum_lut
     The current transformation is        : @/home/dro/deform/warpit
     The current interaction mode is      : <undefined>
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
In the above example no interaction mode is defined.  The next time
you call an application which uses the interaction mode you
would be prompted for a value.   (Under normal circumstances you will not
have to enter the {\tt @} prefix yourself.) 

\subsection{\xlabel{se_parstrings}Strings\label{se:parstrings}}

Notice that the single or double quotes around strings given in
response to prompts for a character parameter can be omitted.  However,
on the command line these delimiters are needed if the string
contains spaces, otherwise the second and subsequent words could be
treated as separate positional parameters.

From the shell the quotes must be escaped.  For example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % settitle myndf \"A new title\"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would assign the title {\tt "A new title"} to the NDF called myndf.

To indicate that the parameter should come from a data-structure object,
prefix the name with an {\tt @} to tell the parameter system that it is
a file name, and not a literal value.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     TITLE - New NDF title /' '/ @$ADAM_USER/galaxy.mytitle
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
In this example TITLE has the value of object MYTITLE in {\tt
galaxy.sdf}.  If the {\tt @} were omitted TITLE would be {\tt
"\$ADAM\_USER/galaxy.mytitle"}.  You will need the {\tt @} prefix if your
file name is a number.  Note that the file extension should not be
included when giving the name of an \HDSref\ data file, including
\NDFref{NDFs}.  Otherwise HDS will look for an object called SDF
nested within the file.

Responses to prompts are case insensitive for comparison purposes.
Strings for character components in NDFs, plot captions and labels
are treated literally.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_pararrays}Arrays\label{se:pararrays}}

If a parameter requires an array of values, the series
should be in brackets separated by commas or spaces.  For example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     PERCENTILES - List of percentiles > [25,95.5,75]
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would input three values: 25, 95.5, and 75 into the real parameter
PERCENTILES.  If the application is expecting an exact number of values
you will be reprompted, either for all the values if you give too many,
or the remaining values if you supply too few.  There is one exception
where you can omit the brackets---a fairly common one---and that is in
response to a prompt for a one-dimensional numeric array as above.

From the shell you must escape the brackets.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % display key=yes mode=pe percentiles=\[95,5\]
     % display key=yes mode=pe percentiles='[95,5]'
     % display key=yes mode=pe percentiles="[95,5]"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
All the above do this.  Single quotes have the advantage
that you can protect all the metacharacters that lie between
the quotes, so you don't need to escape each metacharacter.

Arrays of parameter values should appear in nested brackets.  For
example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     CVALUE - Component values > [[2,3],[5,4],[7,1]]
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
supplies the values for a 2$\times$3-element parameter array, where
element (1,3) has value 7.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_abortnull}Abort and Null\label{se:abortnull}}

Responding to a prompt with a null value {\tt !} will not necessarily
cause the application to abort, but it can force a suitable default to
be used, where this is the most-sensible action.  A further use is
when an optional file may be created, such as a lookup table; a {\tt
!} entered in response to the prompt for the filename means that no
file is to be output.  Many tasks use null as a default for optional
files. In some applications, a null ends an interactive loop.

Responding to a prompt with {\tt !!} will abort the application.  This
process includes the various tidying operations such as the unmapping
and closing of files.  Any other method of stopping an application
prematurely can leave files mapped or corrupted.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_parhelp}Help\label{se:parhelp}}

To get help about a parameter enter {\tt ?}.  Usually, this will give
access to the help-library
information for that parameter, for example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     BOX - Smoothing box size /3,3/ > ?

     BLOCK

       Parameters

         BOX(2) = _INTEGER (Read)
            The x and y sizes (in pixels) of the rectangular box to be
            applied to smooth the image. If only a single value is given,
            then it will be duplicated so that a square filter is used,
            except where the image is 1-dimensional, for which the box
            size along the insignificant dimension is set to 1.  The
            values given will be rounded up to positive odd integers,
            if necessary.

     BOX - Smoothing box size /3,3/ >
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and then immediately reprompt you for the parameter.  There are
occasions when information about the parameter is insufficient; you
may require to examine the examples or the description of related
parameters.  This can be achieved by entering {\tt ??} to the prompt.
You can then delve anywhere in the help information.  When you exit the
help system you're reprompted for the parameter.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_parmenu}Menus\label{se:parmenu}}

Some parameters offer menus from which you select an option.
You do not have to enter the full option string, but merely a string
that selects a choice unambiguously.  In many cases this can be as
little as a single character.  Here is an example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     MODE - Method for selecting contour heights /'Free'/ > ?
         The method used to select the contour levels.  The options are
         described below.

           "Area"      - The contours enclose areas of the array for
                         which the equivalent radius increases by equal
                         increments.  You specify the number of levels.
           "Automatic" - The contour levels are equally spaced between
                         the maximum and minimum pixel values in the
                         array.  You supply the number of contour
                         levels.
           "Free"      - You define a series of contour values
                         explicitly.
           "Linear"    - You define the number of contours, the start
                         contour level and linear step between contours.
           "Magnitude" - You define the number of contours, the start
                         contour level and step between contours.  The
                         step size is in magnitudes so the nth contour
                         is dex(-0.4*(n-1)*step) times the start contour
                         level.

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
where an {\tt F} would be sufficient to select the {\tt "Free"} option,
but at least two characters would be needed if you wanted {\tt "Area"}
or {\tt "Automatic"}.

Some parameters permit a mixture---a choice from a menu, or a
numerical value within a range.  The options are described in full in
\latexelsehtml{the help system and
Appendix~\ref{ap:full}.}{\htmlref{application specifications}{ap:full}.}

\subsection{\xlabel{se_envvar}Environment Variables\label{se:envvar}}

Environment variables operate both on the command line and prompts,
and both from the shell and \ICLref\@.  Thus if IMAGEDIR is
an environment variable pointing to a directory containing the
NDF called ngc1365, you could access it at a prompt as shown
below.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     IN - Input image /@starfield/ > $IMAGEDIR/ngc1365
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{\xlabel{se_cmdlindef}Specifying Parameter Values on Command Lines
\label{se:cmdlindef}}

Parameters may be assigned values on the command line.  This is useful
for running tasks in batch mode and in procedures, and for specifying
the values of parameters that would otherwise be defaulted.  A
command-line parameter will prevent prompting for that parameter unless
there is an error with the given value, say giving an alphabetic
character string where a floating-point value is demanded.

There are two ways in which parameter values may be given on the
command line: by keyword and by position.  The two forms may be
mixed with care.  The parser looks for positional parameters then
keywords, so you can have some positional values followed by keyword
values.  See some of the examples presented in 
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:full}.}{the \htmlref{application
specifications}{ap:full}.}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_parkeyword}Keyword\label{se:parkeyword}}

Keywords may appear in any order.
Here is an example of command-line defaults using keywords.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> picdef current fraction=0.4
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
FRACTION is a real parameter.  CURRENT is a logical parameter; by giving
just its name it is assigned the value {\tt TRUE}.  {\tt CURRENT=T} would
have the same effect.  To obtain a {\tt FALSE} value for a logical parameter
you add a {\tt NO} prefix to keyword, for example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     icl> picdef nocurrent
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would be equivalent to the following.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     icl> picdef current=false
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_parabbrev}Abbreviations\label{se:parabbrev}}

There is an experimental system that allows you to abbreviate
parameter keywords to the minimum unambiguous length.  To use it, you
must first create an environment variable called {\tt ADAM\_ABBRV}
with an arbitrary value.

So for example
\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setenv ADAM_ABBRV true
     % display mo=pe pe=\[5,95\] ba=blue
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would display an NDF between the 5 and 95 percentiles, and marking bad
pixels in blue.

If you give an ambiguous keyword, the parameter system will present
the list of possible keywords and ask you to select the one you
intended.  

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_parposition}Position\label{se:parposition}}

Alternatively, you can specify command-line values by position.
Here is an example.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % thresh raw clipped 0 255
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This applies thresholds to the NDF called raw to form a new NDF
called clipped.  The values between 0 and 255 are unchanged.  Note that
trailing parameters may be omitted---NEWLO and NEWHI in the above
example---but intermediate ones may not.  The position of a parameter
can be found in the {\tt Usage} heading in
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:full}}{the \htmlref{application
specifications}{ap:full}} or the help for the application.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_keyvspar}Keyword versus Positional Parameters
\label{se:keyvspar}}

For tasks with a few parameters, using position is quick and
convenient. However, in complex applications with many parameters it
would be tedious not only to enter all the intermediate values between
the ones you want to define, but also to remember them all.  Another
consideration is that some parameters do not have defined positions
because they are normally defaulted.  Keywords may also be
\htmlref{abbreviated}{se:parabbrev}\latexonly{(Section~\ref{se:parabbrev})}.
Thus the keyword technique is recommended for most parameters,

especially in scripts and procedures. Unabbreviated keywords insulate
scripts against new keywords and positional changes that are sometimes
needed.

See
\latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:custom}}{\htmlref{custom {\footnotesize KAPPA} 
commands}{se:customcom}}
if you want to learn how further to abbreviate command strings to
reduce typing for manual operation.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_parspecial}Special Behaviour\label{se:parspecial}}

Sometimes specifying a parameter on the command line induces different
behaviour, usually to inhibit a loop for procedures, or to eliminate
unnecessary processing.
For instance,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> centroid blob init="51,42" mode=i
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
will determine the centroid near the point (51,42) in the NDF called
blob, and then it exits, whereas without the INIT value you would be
reprompted for a further initial position; and

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % display galaxy mode=sc high=3000 low=1000
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
prevents the calculation of the extreme values of the NDF called
galaxy that are normally given as suggested defaults for parameters
HIGH and LOW, because HIGH and LOW are already known.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_parspeckey}Special Keywords: ACCEPT, PROMPT, RESET
\label{se:parspeckey}}

Another way in which prompts and default values can be controlled is
by use of the keywords ACCEPT, PROMPT and RESET.

The RESET keyword causes the {\em suggested\/} default value of all
parameters (apart from those already specified before it on the
command line) to be set to the original values specified by the
application or its interface file.  In other words global and current
values are ignored.

The PROMPT keyword forces a prompt to appear for every application
parameter.  This can be useful if you cannot remember the name of a
defaulted parameter or there would be too much to type on the command
line.  However, it may prove tedious for certain applications that have
tens of parameters, most of which you normally never see.  You can abort
if it becomes too boring.

The ACCEPT keyword forces the parameter system to accept the suggested
default values either for every application parameter if the keyword
appears on the command line, or all subsequent parameters if it is
supplied to a prompt.  In other words, those parameters which would
normally be prompted with a value between {\tt / /} delimiters take
the value between those delimiters, {\it{e.g.}}\ XDIM we saw in
Section~\ref{se:defaults} would take the value {\tt 64}. Parameters
that are normally defaulted behave as usual.  The ACCEPT keyword needs
to be used with care in scripts because not every parameter has a
default, and therefore must be given on the command line for the
application to work properly.  For example,
\htmlref{CREFRAME}{CREFRAME} must have a value specified for parameter
OUT, the name of the output NDF. If we run the application
like this:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> creframe accept
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
it would fail in the sense that it would still have to prompt for a
value---it does not know where to write the output NDF. 
However, if we run CREFRAME like this:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> creframe out=stars accept
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
it would generate an output image using default values for all the
parameters except OUT, and write the output to file {\tt stars.sdf}.
Another point to be wary of is that some applications have loops,
{\it{e.g.}}\ \htmlref{LOOK}{LOOK},
\htmlref{LUTABLE}{LUTABLE}, and if you use the ACCEPT keyword
it will only operate the first time the application gets a parameter
value.

Sometimes the keyword ACCEPT can be used without any parameter value
specifications on the command line.
For example, we could follow the above command by the command:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> look accept
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and the central 7$\times$7 array of the image created by CREFRAME would
be displayed on your terminal without any parameter values being
prompted.  The symbol \verb+\+ has the same effect as ACCEPT
when used on the command line or at prompts, thus:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> look \
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would have the same effect as the previous example---and is quicker
to type.  In command lines from the shell, the backslash is a
metacharacter and has to be escaped.  The easiest way to do that is
to double the backslash.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % look \\
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

How do you find out which parameters have suggested defaults, as
opposed to those that are normally defaulted?  Well, a good rule of
thumb is that parameters for output files (images, lookup tables and
text) will not have a default, but the remainder will.  There are some
exceptions, such as where null is the default for optional files.
Consulting the description of the parameters should give the suggested
defaults, where appropriate. If a parameter is given a suggested
default it will have a line beginning {\tt ppath} or a {\tt default}
line. If you want to use ACCEPT for an automatic procedure or batch
job you could do some tests to find which parameters get prompted and
then put them on the command line in your procedure.

The RESET and ACCEPT keywords will work in tandem.  So for instance,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> look reset accept
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
will reset the suggested defaults of \htmlref{LOOK}{LOOK} to their
original, preset values, and accept these as the parameter values.

These special keywords may be abbreviated to no fewer than
two characters, if you have enabled
\htmlref{keyword-abbreviation}{se:parabbrev}\latexonly{ (Section~\ref{se:parabbrev})}.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_parminmax}MIN and MAX parameter values
\label{se:parminmax}}

Many parameters have well-defined ranges of allowed values. In some
cases it is useful to assign the maximum or minimum value to the
parameter.  Rather than give some numerical value, you can instead
supply {\tt MIN} to select the minimum-allowed value, and {\tt MAX}
to select the maximum.  This applies both on the command line and at
prompts.  In the example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % block wlim=max
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
parameter WLIM takes its maximum (1.0) meaning that if any of the
input pixels in the smoothing box is bad, the corresponding output
pixel is set bad.

Consult the reference section or the online help to see if a given
parameter has such a range.  If you attempt to use {\tt MIN} and
{\tt MAX} where there is no range defined, you'll see an error
message like

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    !! SUBPAR_MNMX: Parameter FONT - no upper limit set
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and you'll be invited to give another value.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_groups}Specifying Groups of Objects\label{se:groups}}

Some parameters are describing in the reference documentation as being
associated with a ``group'' of objects. For instance, some parameters may
require a group of strings, others may require a group of numerical
values, or data files.  No matter what the nature of the object, groups
are specified using a syntax called a ``group expression''. The GRP
library is used to interpret these group expressions, and the \xref{GRP
documentation}{sun150}{} \latexonly{ (SUN/150)}, should be consulted for
full details. A summary is given here.

A group expression can identify the members of the group in any of the
following ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item As a comma separated list ( \emph{e.g.} ``12.1, 23.2, 1.3''
     or ``HH1\_B1S1,HH2\_B1S2'' ). 

\item By reading them from a text file (see
     ``\htmlref{Indirection}{SEC:IND}'').

\item By modifying an existing group of objects using editing 
     specified within the group expression (see
     ``\htmlref{Modification}{SEC:MOD}'').
\end{itemize}

A typical group expression will often include characters which are of
significance to the shell. If the group expression is supplied on the
command line it may be necessary to place quotes around the string to
prevent the shell from removing these characters. Two lots of quotes are
usually required, as in the following example where a group expression
(in this case, a comma separated list) is used to specify a plotting
style:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % display style='"grid=1,colour(grid)=red,title=My new image"'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

These quotes are not required if the group expression is given in
response to a prompt.

If the supplied group expression is terminated with a minus sign, the
user is re-prompted for another group expression (using the same
parameter). The objects specified by this second group expression are
added to those specified by the first. This re-prompting continues until
a group expression is supplied which does not end with a minus sign.

Certain classes of objects have additional features, for instance if the
objects are the names of data files, then wild-card characters are
allowed in the supplied values (see \hyperref{here}{section }{}{SEC:NDF})

\subsubsection{\label{SEC:IND}Indirection}
It is sometimes convenient to store the strings specifying the objects to
be used within a text file. The name of the text file can then be given
in response to a prompt for a group expression, rather than giving a long
list of explicit values. This is done by preceding the name of the text
file with an up-arrow (``\verb+^+'') character. For instance, the group
expression ``\^{}\verb+style.dat+'' would result in the file
\verb+style.dat+ being opened and the strings read from the file. Each
line within the file is considered to be a group expression, and is
processed in the same way as a group expression supplied directly. In
particular, a text file may contain references to other text files. If
the file \verb+style.dat+ contained the following two lines:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   grid=1,colour(grid)=red,border=1
   colour(border)=red,^labels.dat
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

then the strings \verb+grid=1+, \verb+colour(grid)=red+, \verb+border=1+
and \verb+colour(border)=red+ would be returned to the application, and
in addition the file \verb+labels.dat+ would be searched for further
strings. This nesting of text files can go down to seven levels. Text
files may also contain comments. Anything occurring after a ``\verb+#+''
character is ignored. To ignore an entire line the \verb+#+ character
must be in column 1 (any blanks in front of the \verb+#+ character are
considered to be significant).

\subsubsection{\label{SEC:GRPEDIT}Editing}
A group expression can contain a request to edit the supplied strings
before passing them to the application. The editing facilities provided
are fairly simple. You can:

\begin{itemize}
\item Add a specified prefix to the start of each string.
\item Add a specified suffix to the end of each string.
\item Replace all occurences of a given sub-string in each string.
\item Any combination of the above.
\end{itemize}

To perform this editing, you:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Enclose the group expression specifying the strings to be edited 
within curly braces (``\verb+{+'' and ``\verb+}+''). Note, if no prefix 
or suffix is supplied, and the group expression is not a comma separated 
list, then the curly braces can be omitted.

\item Preceed the opening curly brace with the prefix (if any) to be added 
to the start of each string.

\item Follow the closing curly brace with the suffix (if any) to be added 
to the end of each string.

\item Append a string specifying the substitution to be performed (if any)
to the end of the whole thing. This string should be of the form
\verb+|<old>|<new>|+ where \verb+<old>+ is the text to be replaced and 
\verb+<new>+ is the text with which to replace it. Note, the substitutions
occur \emph{before} any specified prefix or suffix is added to the 
strings.

\end{enumerate}

For instance;

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   A{^file}B|my|your|
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This will read strings from the text file \verb+file+. Each occurence of
the string ``my'' will then be replaced by ``your''. The resulting
strings will then have ``A'' added at the start, and ``B'' added at the
end.

\subsubsection{\label{SEC:MOD}Modification}
A group of objects can be given by specifying some editing to
apply to another already existing group of objects. For instance,
if the string \verb+new_*b|_ds|_im|+ was given in response to a request
for a group expression, then the following steps occur: 

\begin{itemize}
\item   Each element in some existing group of objects (identified in 
     the description of the parameter concerned) is substituted 
     in turn for the ``\verb+*+'' character.
\item  Any occurrences of the string ``\_ds'' is replaced by the string 
     ``\_im''.
\item  The string ``b'' is added to the end of the string.
\item  The string ``new\_'' is added to the start of the string.
\end{itemize}

Thus if the existing group contained the strings \verb+file1_ds+ and
\verb+file2_ds+, the resulting group would be \verb+new_file1_imb+
and \verb+new_file2_imb+. Note, this facility is only available if
the parameter description identifies an existing group which will be used
as the basis for the modified strings.

\subsubsection{Ignoring Syntax Characters}
You can see from the above that several characters have special meanings 
within group expressions. Examples are \verb+^+ \verb+|+ \verb+-+
\emph{etc}. This may sometimes cause a problem if you want to include
these characters within the strings being passed to the application. For
instance, if you want to specify a group of data files using a shell
pipe-line, you may want to do something like:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % display 
     IN - NDF to be displayed > `find . -newer a.fit | grep good `
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Within a group expression, the \verb+|+ character indicates a request for
a string substitution (as described above). In this case, the GRP library
considers the request to be incomplete because there is only one \verb+|+
character, and issues an error report. Of course, the \verb+|+ character
was actually intended to indicate that the output from the \verb+find+
command should become the input to the \verb+grep+ command. This can be 
accomplished by \emph{escaping} the \verb+|+ character so that its
special meaning within the context of a group expression is ignored.

To escape a group expression syntax character, it should be preceded
with a backslash (``\verb+\+''). So the above command should be changed to:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % display 
     IN - NDF to be displayed > `find . -newer a.fit \| grep good `
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Any other special character can be escaped in the same way. For instance,
you can escape commas within text strings using this method.

\subsubsection{Groups of Data Files}
\label{SEC:NDF}

If a group expression is used to specify a list of input data files (NDFs
or positions lists), then file names may be specified which contain wild
card characters (``\verb+*+'' and ``?'' -- character classes can also be
matched using strings such as ``[0-9]'', ``[abcd]'', \emph{etc}). These
will be expanded into a list of explicit file names before returning the
group to the application.

If a group of output data files are specified by modification of a
previously supplied group of input data files, the asterisk in the output
group expression refers just to the file base-name (\emph{i.e.} without
directory path or file type). So, for instance, the group expression
\verb+B_*+ would cause each output file name to be equal to the
corresponding input file name, but with ``B\_'' added to the start of the
file base name. Thus an input file \verb+/home/dsb/data.fit+ would result
in an output file \verb+/home/dsb/B_data.fit+. If no directory is given
in the output group expression, the directory associated with the input
file is then added to the start of the file name. Likewise, any HDS path
or file type is inherited from the input file if none are given in the
output group expression.

If the final character in a group expression is a colon (:), then a list
of the data files represented by the group expression (minus the colon)
is displayed, but no data files are actually added to the group of files
to be processed. The user is then re-prompted for another group
expression, using the same parameter.

If an HDS container file\footnote{HDS container files can usually be 
identified by the fact they have a file type of {\tt .sdf}. They can be 
used to store one or more standard Starlink NDF structures.} is supplied
which contains two or more NDF structures, then each NDF within the
container file is processed as a separate image. NDFs which are contained
within an extension of another NDF are not included.

If a group of native output NDFs are created by modification of a group
of native input NDFs (\emph{i.e.} if the supplied string includes an
asterisk), then the structure of each output container file will be
copied from the corresponding input container file. For instance, if the
container file \verb+o66_int.sdf+ contains 16 NDFs in components
\verb+I1+ to \verb+I16+, then specifying ``\verb+o66_int+'' when asked
for a group of input images will result in all 16 NDFs being used. If the
corresponding output images are specified using the string ``\verb+*_A+''
then a single output file named \verb+o66_int_A.sdf+ will be created. The
structure of this file will be copied from the input file, and will
therefore contain the 16 output NDFs in components \verb+I1+ to
\verb+I16+.

\subsubsection{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item If an application asks for a group of input data files, the following 
are all possible responses:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   b1,b2,b3,b4
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}

This means ``Use the NDFs stored in files \verb+b1.sdf+, \verb+b2.sdf+,
\verb+b3.sdf+ and \verb+b4.sdf+''. If \htmlref{`on-the-fly format
conversion'}{se:autoconvert} (see \latexonly{Section~\ref{se:autoconvert}
and} \xref{SUN/55}{sun55}{}) is being used, then this example would pick
up data files with the highest priority data format (\emph{i.e.} the
format nearest to the start of the list of formats supplied in
environment variable NDF\_FORMATS\_IN). So for instance, if the current
directory contained both \verb+b1.sdf+ and \verb+b1.fit+, then only one
file would be used, depending on the relative positions of the ``.sdf''
and ``.fit'' formats within NDF\_FORMATS\_IN. If you want to restrict
things explicitly to a particular data format, then you should include
the corresponding file type in the group expression. An example such as:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   b1.fit,b2.fit,b3.fit,b4.fit
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

would read just the specified FITS files.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   cena_b1-
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}

This means ``Use \verb+cena_b1.sdf+ and then (because of the minus sign
at the end) ask the user for more data files''.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   *
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}
This means ``Use all accessible data files in the current directory''. 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   hh1_b1s*_ds
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}
This means ``Use \verb+hh1_b1s1_ds.sdf+, \verb+hh1_b1s2_ds.sdf+, \emph{etc}''.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   hh1_b[12]s*_ds
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}

This means ``Use \verb+hh1_b1s1_ds.sdf+, \verb+hh1_b1s2_ds.sdf+,
\emph{etc}, and also \verb+hh1_b2s1_ds.sdf+, \verb+hh1_b2s2_ds.sdf+,
\emph{etc}''. The string ``[12]'' matches either a single character ``1''
or a single character ``2''. The string ``[0-9]'' would match any single
digit character. The string ``[a-z]'' would match any single lowercase
alphabetical character.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   data.fit[12]
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}

This means ``Use files \verb+data.fit1+ and \verb+data.fit2+ if they
exist. If neither of these files exists, use the twelth image extension 
in the multi-extension FITS file \verb+data.fit+''.


\small
\begin{verbatim}
   ^files.lis
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}
This means ``Read the names of data files from the text file
\verb+files.lis+.''

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   ../data/*
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}
This means ``Use all accessible data files contained in the directory 
\verb+../data+''.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   data_{new,old,back}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}
This means ``Use files \verb+data_new.sdf+, \verb+data_old.sdf+ and
\verb+data_back.sdf+''.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   {^files}_A
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}
This means ``Read names of data files from text file \verb+files+ and 
append \verb+_A+ to the end of each one''.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   `grep -l "OBJECT  = 'm57'" *.fit`
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}

The string is enclosed in back quotes (\verb+`+) which causes the string
to be executed as a shell command, and the resulting output to be used as
the group expression. Thus this example means ``Use all FITS files which
contain an OBJECT keyword equal to 'm57'''.


\item If an application asks for a group of output data files, the following 
are possible responses:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   file1,file2,file3
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}
This means ``Create \verb+file1.sdf+, \verb+file2.sdf+ and \verb+file3.sdf+''.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   ^out.dat
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}
This means ``Read the names of the output data files from text file \verb+out.dat+''.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   *_ds
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}
This means ``Append the string ``\_ds'' to the end of all 
                      the input data file names.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   ../bk/*|_ds|_bk|
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\vspace{-3mm}
This means ``Substitute the string ``\_bk'' for all  occurrences of the string
``\_ds'' in the  input data file names, and put the files in 
directory \verb+../bk+''.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\xlabel{se_parout}Output Parameters\label{se:parout}}

Not only can programmes have parameters to which you supply values,
but they can also write out the results of their calculations to {\em
output\/} or {\em results parameters}.  This makes the results
accessible to subsequent tasks and to shell and \ICLref\ variables.
Example results are statistics like the standard deviation or the FWHM
of the point-spread function, the co-ordinates of points selected by a
cursor, or the attributes of an NDF.  They are not data files created
by the application.  In
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:full}}{the \htmlref{application
specifications}{ap:full}} they are listed separately from
other parameters.

From the shell you can access these output parameters using the
{\footnotesize KAPPA} tool \htmlref{PARGET}{PARGET}.  Suppose that you
want to subtract the mean of an NDF called myndf to make an
a new NDF called outndf.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % stats myndf > /dev/null
    % set mean = `parget mean stats`
    % csub myndf $mean outndf 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\htmlref{STATS}{STATS} calculates the statistics of myndf,
the displayed output being discarded.  PARGET reports the mean value
which is assigned to shell variable {\tt mean}.  Thereafter the mean
value is accessible as {\tt \$mean} in that process.  Thus the final
command subtracts the mean from myndf.

You can obtain vector values too.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % ndftrace myndf > /dev/null
    % set axlab = `parget alabel ndftrace`
    % display otherndf style="'label(1)=$axlab[1],label(2)=$axlab[2]"' axes 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This displays the image otherndf surrounded by axes, but the plot's
axis labels originate from another dataset called myndf
\footnote{ The {\tt style} parameter specifies the appearance of the annotated axes,
and is given as a comma-separated group of \emph{attribute settings}, each
of which is a {\tt name=value} string specifying the attribute name and
value. In this case, we assign values to the two attributes {\tt label(1)}
and {\tt label(2)}. The whole group must be enclosed in single quotes to
prevent the parameter system splitting the string at the commas. The
string must then also be enclosed in double quotes to prevent the UNIX shell
from interpreting the parantheses and equals signs. A simpler way of
specifying a ploting style is to put the attribute settings in a 
\htmlref{text file}{se:style} \latexonly{(see Section~\ref{se:style})}.}.
There are more examples in the \xref{{\sl C-Shell Cookbook}}{sc4}{}.

At the time of writing, ICL only permits scalar variables.  To do the
first example above from ICL, you would enter something like this.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    ICL> stats myndf mean=(vmean)
    ICL> csub myndf (vmean) outndf 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
{\tt vmean} is an ICL variable.  The parentheses have the same effect
as the \verb+$+ in the C-shell example, meaning ``the value of'' the
variable.  Note that you can't redirect the output to {\tt /dev/null}.

If you use the \htmlref{PROMPT keyword}{se:parspeckey}
\latexonly{(see Section~\ref{se:parspeckey})} for an application with output
parameters, the programme will bizarrely prompt you for these.  It is
not asking for a value, but a {\em location\/} where to store the
value.  It is strongly recommended that you just accept the default
(normally zero) so that the values are written to their parameter
file, and hence permits PARGET to work.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{se_graphdev}Graphics Devices and Files\label{se:graphdev}}

\subsection{\xlabel{se_selgradev}Selecting a Graphics Device
\label{se:selgradev}}

You can find the list of available devices and their names with task
\htmlref{GDNAMES}{GDNAMES}.  Names can be abbreviated provided they
remain unambiguous. Two alternative naming schemes are supported, and
the list produced by GDNAMES will include both; 

\begin{description}
\item [PGPLOT] A general graphics device specification is of the form
\verb+<file>/<type>+, where \verb+<type>+ indicates the type of the
graphics device (\emph{e.g.} postscript printer, X-window, \emph{etc.})
and \verb+<file>+ is an optional string which indicates either a file in
which the graphical output should be stored or a specification for a
particular device of the specified type. For instance, \verb+m31.ps/VPS+
produces a file called \verb+m31.ps+ containing output suitable for
sending to a postscript printer in portrait mode, and
\verb+xwindows2/GWM+ sends graphical output to the GWM X-window with name
\verb+xwindows2+. If the \verb+<file>+ string is omitted, a default
device-dependant value is used (for instance, \verb+pgplot.ps+ for
postscipt files and \verb+xwindows+ for X-windows).

\item [GNS] For compatibility with previous versions of {\footnotesize KAPPA} 
graphics devices may also be specified using a scheme which approximates
closely to that of the Starlink Graphics workstation Name Service (GNS)
library (see \xref{SUN/188}{sun188}{}). In this scheme a complete
workstation specification is of the form \verb+<type>;<file>+. This is
very similar to the PGPLOT scheme described above, but the device type
and file are swapped round, and the separator is a semi-colon instead of
a slash. As for PGPLOT, the device file can be omitted, in which case a
default is used, but note that \emph{in this case the semi-colon should
also be omitted}. The only supported devices are those for which PGPLOT
drivers are available. If a device was also available in the GKS-based
graphics systems previously used by {\footnotesize KAPPA}, then you can
refer to it either using its PGPLOT device type or its GNS device type.

\end{description}

In either scheme, either the device type or the file name or the entire
device specification may be replaced by a logical name, in which case the
value of the logical name will be used instead.


\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_devglobal}Global Parameters\label{se:devglobal}}

There is a global parameter for the graphics device.
The purpose of this global parameter is ostensibly to prevent
unnecessary prompting. However, there is an ulterior motive as well. 
The selection of devices outside of the graphics applications enables
us to perform other necessary actions just once. 

There is a command for selecting the current graphics device:
\htmlref{GDSET}{GDSET}. For example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> gdset xwindows
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

A selection remains in force until you change it using GDSET again, use
\htmlref{NOGLOBALS}{NOGLOBALS}, or delete the globals file.  The current
choice can be inspected via the \htmlref{GLOBALS}{GLOBALS} command. If the
global parameter is undefined you will be prompted for the device if an
application requires it.

You can override the global parameter for the duration of a single
application by specifying it by keyword (normally {\tt DEVICE=}), or in
some applications, by position.  Here is an example.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> contour device=ps_p
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_x-windows}X-windows\label{se:x-windows}}

The most commonly used devices are X-windows.  These can require a little
preparation before you select a device.  Starlink graphics use
\GWMref\ to manage windows.  It enables a window to persist between
separate applications; or to be shared by different applications,
potentially even running on different machines.  See
\xref{SUN/130}{sun130}{} for details of {\footnotesize GWM} and how to
change your X-defaults file ({\tt{\$HOME/.Xdefaults}}), but the salient
points are given below.

If the window appears on a terminal or workstation other than the one
running the {\footnotesize KAPPA} executables you will need to redirect
output to your screen, if you have not already done so for some other
software.  You either use the \xref{{\tt xdisplay}}{sun129}{} command

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % xdisplay myterm.mysite.mydomain.mycountry
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
or set the DISPLAY environment variable to point to the address of
your screen.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % setenv DISPLAY myterm.mysite.mydomain.mycountry:0
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
You substitute your machine's address or IP number.  (Ask your
computer manager.)

If you do not create the window before running {\footnotesize KAPPA}, the
first graphics application to open an X-windows device will create the
window, using certain defaults.  The defaults control amongst others
the foreground and background colours, the number of colours
allocated, the size and location of the window.  These defaults may be
altered with an X-defaults file, or a window created with the {\footnotesize
GWM} {\tt xmake} command.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % xmake xwindows -geom 600x450 -fg yellow -bg black
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This example makes a window of dimension 600-by-450 pixels, the
background colour is black and colour for the line graphics is
yellow. 

The following set up to place in your X-defaults file is a reasonable
compromise, as it maximises the number of colour indices for the
graphics window (xwindows), and has a second graphics window (x2windows).  
In the defaults file there are the following lines

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     gwm*xwindows*colours:         80
     gwm*xwindows2*colours:        20
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and you can also set the sizes of the windows too.  Notice that the
second device name is x2windows, but the window name is xwindows2.
Don't ask why.  This
confusing name rule applies also to all but the first window of the
maximum of four windows allowed.

The device names can be abbreviated, to give unambiguous names.  Thus you
can enter {\tt xw} for the xwindows device; {\tt x2w} for the x2windows
device; and so on.  This is the reason for having device names as they
are.

The following tells {\footnotesize KAPPA} that this is the current device.
This remains as a global parameter, so you probably will not need to
issue this command that often.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % gdset x2windows
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\bigskip

\subsection{Composite Hardcopy Plots}

{\footnotesize KAPPA} applications are modular so that you can build up
more-complicated plots, and possibly add annotations with other packages
especially \PONGOref\@.  This is fine if the device is some sort of
screen.  However, when it is a hardcopy device, \PGPLOTref\ puts the
output from a command into a single disk file.  So how do you get the
composite plot out on paper?  Well you can't just append these files to
create a single output.

What you must do is as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item  Select an encapsulated PostScript device, be it colour or monochrome.
\item  Produce your graphics, being careful to rename the output file
(usually \verb+pgplot.ps+) created by each command to avoid it being
over-written by the output from the next command. Alternatively, you can
specified the device to use separately when running each command, including an
explicit unique file name in each device specification (see above).
\item Use \PSMERGEref\ to combine the plots.
\end{itemize}

To give an example, suppose we wanted to overlay a contour plot
on an image.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % gdset epsfcol_l
    % display $KAPPA_DIR/comwest lut=$KAPPA_DIR/spectrum_lut mode=ra axes
    % mv pgplot.ps display.ps
    % contour noclear mode=au \\
    % mv pgplot.ps contour.ps
    % psmerge display.ps contour.ps  > myplot.ps
    % rm display.ps contour.ps 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

or alternatively:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % display $KAPPA_DIR/comwest device="epsfcol_l;display.ps" \
              lut=$KAPPA_DIR/spectrum_lut mode=ra axes
    % contour noclear device="epsfcol_l;contour.ps" mode=au \\
    % psmerge display.ps contour.ps  > myplot.ps
    % rm display.ps contour.ps 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

You then print {\tt myplot.ps} to the colour PostScript printer.
PSMERGE also has options for scaling and rotating plots.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{se_style}Plotting Styles and Attributes\label{se:style}}

\subsection{\xlabel{se_styles}Plotting Styles and Attributes\label{se:styles}}

Many different aspects of the appearance of line graphics produced by 
{\footnotesize KAPPA} applications can be controlled by specifying a
{\em plotting style} when running the application. This includes things
like the colour, line width, line style, character size, and font, each
of which can be specified individually for different components of a plot
({\it e.g.} the tick marks, numerical labels, border, textual labels, 
{\it etc}). 

Each aspect of a plot is controlled by a \emph{plotting attribute}. 
A plotting attribute has a \emph{name} and a \emph{value}.

Strings which assign new values to particular plotting attributes are
called attribute setting strings. For instance:

are two attribute setting strings. The first assigns the value {\tt 1} to
the attribute called {\tt Border}, and the second assigns the string
``{\tt This is my plot title}'' to the attribute with name {\tt Title}
(attribute names are case insensitive but cannot be abbreviated).

Here is a list of the available attributes, with a brief description of
each. Full descriptions are included later in this section.

\begin{verse}
{\tt Border}: Draw a border around valid regions of a plot?\\
{\tt Colour(element)}: Colour for a plot element\\
{\tt DrawAxes}: Draw axes?\\
{\tt DrawTitle}: Draw a title?\\
{\tt Edge(axis)}: Which edges to label\\
{\tt Font(element)}: Character font for a plot element\\
{\tt Gap(axis)}: Interval between major axis values\\
{\tt Grid}: Draw grid lines?\\
{\tt LabelAt(axis)}: Where to place numerical labels\\
{\tt LabelUnits(axis)}: Include unit descriptions in axis labels?\\
{\tt LabelUp(axis)}: Draw numerical axis labels upright?\\
{\tt Labelling}: Label and tick placement option\\
{\tt MajTickLen}: Length of major tick marks \\
{\tt MinTickLen}: Length of minor tick marks \\
{\tt MinTick(axis)}: Density of minor tick marks\\
{\tt NumLab(axis)}: Draw numerical axis labels?\\
{\tt NumLabGap(axis)}: Spacing of numerical axis labels\\
{\tt Size(element)}: Character size for a plot element\\
{\tt Style(element)}: Line style for a plot element\\
{\tt TextBackColour}: Background colour to use when drawing text\\
{\tt TextLab(axis)}: Draw descriptive axis labels?\\

{\tt TickAll}: Draw tick marks on all edges?\\
{\tt TitleGap}: Vertical spacing for the title\\
{\tt Tol}: Plotting tolerance\\
{\tt Width(element)}: Line width for a plot element
\end{verse}

Some attribute names can be qualified so that they refer to a particular
component of the plot. This is done by putting the qualifier in
parentheses after the attribute name.  For instance:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   Colour(border)=2
   Edge(2)=left
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

assigns the value {\tt 2} to the {\tt Colour} attribute for the plot border,
and assigns the value {\tt left} to the {\tt Edge} attribute for the second
axis. The full description of each attribute describes what happens if
you omit the qualifier. Attribute names which end in ``{\tt (axis)}'' in
the above list can be qualified by an integer axis index to refer to a
particular plot axis. Attribute names which end in ``{\tt (element)}'' in
the above list can be qualified by any of the following strings to refer to 
a particular component of the plot (the qualifiers are case-insensitive and
unambiguous abbreviations may be used):

\begin{verse}
{\tt Axes}: Axis lines drawn through tick marks within the plotting area,
drawn if attribute {\tt DrawAxes} is given a
non-zero value. Values set using ``Axes'' are
only only used if axis-specific values have not been set using ``Axis1''
or ``Axis2''. Thus, ``Axes'' provides default values for ``Axis1'' and
``Axis2''. \\
{\tt Axis1}: An axis line drawn through tick marks on axis 1 within the 
plotting area, drawn if attribute {\tt DrawAxes} is given a
non-zero value. Values specified using ``Axis1'' override any supplied

{\tt Axis2}: An axis line drawn through tick marks on axis 2 within the 
plotting area, drawn if attribute {\tt DrawAxes} is given a
non-zero value. Values specified using ``Axis2'' override any supplied
using ``Axes''. \\
{\tt Border}: The plot border, drawn if attribute {\tt Border} is given a non-zero value.\\
{\tt Curves}: Curves drawn over the top of a plot ({\it e.g.} contours, data curves, {\it etc}).\\
{\tt Grid}: The grid lines, drawn if attribute {\tt Grid} is given a non-zero value.
Values set using ``Grid'' are
only only used if axis-specific values have not been set using ``Grid1''
or ``Grid2''. Thus, ``Grid'' provides default values for ``Grid1'' and
``Grid2''. \\
{\tt Grid1}: Grid lines which cross axis 1, drawn if attribute {\tt Grid} 
is given a non-zero value. Values specified using ``Grid1'' override any 
supplied using ``Grid''. \\
{\tt Grid2}: Grid lines which cross axis 2, drawn if attribute {\tt Grid} 
is given a non-zero value. Values specified using ``Grid2'' override any 
supplied using ``Grid''. \\
{\tt Markers}: Graphical markers (symbols) drawn over a plot.\\
{\tt NumLab}: Numerical axis labels drawn around annotated axes.

``NumLab1'' override any supplied using ``NumLab''. \\
{\tt NumLab2}: Numerical labels drawn along axis 2. Values specified using 
``NumLab2'' override any supplied using ``NumLab''. \\
{\tt Strings}: Text strings drawn over a plot (except for axis labels and plot title).\\
{\tt TextLab}: Descriptive axis labels drawn around annotated axes.
Values set using ``TextLab'' are
only only used if axis-specific values have not been set using ``TextLab1''
or ``TextLab2''. Thus, ``TextLab'' provides default values for ``TextLab1'' 
and ``TextLab2''. \\
{\tt TextLab1}: Descriptive label for axis 1. Values specified using 
``TextLab1'' override any supplied using ``TextLab''. \\
{\tt TextLab2}: Descriptive label for axis 2. Values specified using 
``TextLab2'' override any supplied using ``TextLab''. \\
{\tt Ticks}: Tick marks (both major and minor) drawn along annotated axes.
Values set using ``Ticks'' are
only only used if axis-specific values have not been set using ``Ticks1''

Values specified using ``Ticks1'' override any supplied using ``Ticks''. \\
{\tt Ticks2}: Tick marks (both major and minor) drawn along axis 2.

{\tt Title}: The title drawn at the top of a plot.
\end{verse}

A collection of attribute settings is called a \emph{plotting style}.
Attributes which are not specified in a plotting style take on default
values as described later. An example of a plotting style is contained in
the file {\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/style.def}. This file defines the default
style used by {\footnotesize KAPPA}.

In general each graphical application will determine the plotting style
to be used when drawing line graphics by accessing a parameter called 
STYLE. Some applications have more than one style parameter. For instance, 
applications such as \htmlref{CONTOUR}{CONTOUR} and
\htmlref{LINPLOT}{LINPLOT} which produce keys to the content of the plot
have a parameter called KEYSTYLE, in addition to the normal STYLE
parameter. KEYSTYLE is used to specify the plotting style for the key,
whereas STYLE is used to specify the plotting style for the main plot.

\subsection{Specifying a Plotting Style}
\subsubsection{Group Expressions}
The application parameters which are used to access plotting styles
(STYLE, KEYSTYLE, {\it etc}) expect a group
of attribute setting strings to be supplied for the parameter. These
should be supplied in the form of a \emph{group expression}.\footnote{The
complete group expression syntax is described in \xref{SUN/150}{}{sun150}. 
This is the documentation for the GRP subroutine library which provides 
a programming interface for obtaining groups of strings.}

A group expression is a character string containing a list of one or more
sub-strings separated by some specified delimiter. The usual delimiter
used when accessing plotting style parameters is a comma (although other
parameters which require group expressions for other purposes may use a
different delimiter). Each sub-string is known as a group \emph{element}.
Each group element must be either:

\begin{itemize}
\item an attribute setting string ({\it e.g.} ``{\tt Border=1}''), or
\item the name of a text file, preceded by an up-arrow character (``\verb+^+''). 
\end{itemize}

If a group element starts with an up-arrow character, then the rest of
the element is interpreted as a file name, and an attempt is made to read
further group elements from the specified file. Each
line in the file is interpreted as a group expression in its own right,
using exactly the same rules as described above. In particular,
references to text files can be nested ({\it i.e.} a text file can
include a group element which refers to another text file). Blank lines
and lines in which the first non-blank character is a hash (``\verb+#+'')
are ignored and can be used to add textual comments to a text file.

Attribute settings are used in the order in which they occur in the group
expression. If a group expression includes more than one setting string for 
a given attribute, then the value which occurs nearest to the end of the
group expression will over-write any earlier values.

All this means that there are several ways in which plotting styles can be
supplied. The simplest method is probably to store all your attribute
setting strings in a text file, one per line, and then just give the name
of this text file (preceded by an up-arrow) as the value for the STYLE
parameter. For instance, the file {\tt style.dat} may contain:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   # A test plotting style
   
   width=2
   edge(2)=right
   title=This is my title
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The first line and the following blank line are ignored. The remaining three
lines specify three attribute values to use. When running an application
such as \htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY}, this style file would be specified on
the command line as follows:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % display style=^style.dat
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Alternatively, you can specify the setting strings explicitly on the
command line. This can get a bit messy because you need to protect 
special characters (commas, parentheses, spaces, equals signs, and so on)
both from the Unix shell and from the parameter system. One safe way
to do this is to enclose the whole group expression in single quotes, and
then enclose the whole thing again in double quotes.\footnote{The up-arrow
character is not one of these special characters, and so a simple
reference to a single text file does not need to be enclosed in quotes.}
So the above style could be given on the command line as follows:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % display style="'width=2,edge(2)=right,title=This is my title'"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

A bit messy as I said! However, it can be useful to combine this method
with the previous method. If you have a long, complicated style file, and 
you want to change one or two attribute settings, one method would be to
take a copy of the style file and edit it. This would probably be the
best thing to do if you intend to re-use the edited style file several
times. But if you just want to try a quick experiment, just to see what
the results look like, you can avoid the trouble of editing the style file
by giving both the original style file \emph{and} the new attribute settings 
on the command line. For instance:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % display style="'^style.dat,width=3'"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This reads the contents of our test style file {\tt style.dat}, which
includes the attribute setting {\tt width=2}. It then also applies the
attribute setting {\tt width=3}, over-writing the effect of the {\tt Width}
value included in the style file. If you wanted to try temporarily changing
the value of several attributes at once, you could put the new attribute
settings into a second file, say {\tt style2.dat}, and then run the 
application as follows:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % display style="'^style.dat,^style2.dat'"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Again, the contents of {\tt style.dat} would be read, followed by the
contents of {\tt style2.dat}, over-writing any settings for the same
attributes included in {\tt style.dat}.

\subsubsection{Synonyms for Attribute Names}
The available plotting attributes and their names are defined by the
AST subroutine library (see \xref{SUN/210}{}{sun210}) upon which 
{\footnotesize KAPPA} graphics are based (together with PGPLOT).
However, {\footnotesize KAPPA} provides synonyms for certain 
plotting attributes where this would provide a clearer indication of the
purpose of the attribute within the context of a particular application. 
These synonyms are listed in the description of the STYLE parameter for
the particular applications concerned. For instance, the
\htmlref{CONTOUR}{CONTOUR} applications draws contours as ``curves'', 
that is, it uses the attributes {\tt Colour(Curves)}, {\tt Width(Curves)}
and {\tt Style(Curves)} to determine the appearance of the contours.
However, the synonym {\tt Contours} (minimum abbreviation {\tt Cont}) may be
used in place of {\tt Curves}, so the appearance of the contours can also
be specified using the ``pseudo-'' attributes {\tt Colour(Cont)}, {\tt
Width(Cont)} and {\tt Style(Cont)}.

You should remember that a synonym is simply an alternative way of
specifying a particular attribute. So if you are running CONTOUR and you
give the two setting strings:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   Colour(cont)=red
   Colour(curve)=blue
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

the contours will appear blue, not red, because the second attribute
setting over-rides the first one.

Any particular synonym will only be recognised by certain applications.
Thus, {\tt Contours} is only recognised as a synonym for {\tt Curves} when 
running CONTOUR. Applications ignore attributes (or synonyms) which they
do not recognise, without reporting an error. Thus if the file containing 
your default plotting style (used by all applications --- see later)
contains the two lines:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   Colour(curve)=blue
   Colour(cont)=red
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

then CONTOUR will draw contours in red, but other applications will draw
their curves in blue since they ignore the {\tt Colour(cont)=red} line.
Note, if these two lines were the other way round:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   Colour(cont)=red
   Colour(curve)=blue
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

then all curves, \emph{including} contours drawn by CONTOUR, would be
blue. This is because CONTOUR will process both lines in the order
supplied, ending up with blue contours.

\subsubsection{Colour Attributes}
The {\tt Colour} attribute can be used to specify the colours of various
components of a plot. The value assigned to the attribute can be:
\begin{itemize}

\item An integer colour index. Colour indices can be thought of as ``pen 
numbers''. For instance, the string {\tt Colour(border)=3} says ``Draw the 
border using pen number 3''. The resulting colour depends on the colour of 
pen 3, which can be set using \htmlref{PALENTRY}{PALENTRY}. 

\item A standard X colour name, \emph{e.g.} {\tt Colour(border)=red}.

\item A triple of floating point red, green and blue intensity values in
the range zero to one, separated by spaces, \emph{e.g.} 
{\tt Colour(border)=1.0 0.0 0.0}.

\item An HTML colour code. This is a hash followed by 3 pairs of hexadecimal 
digits giving red, green and blue intensity in the range 0 to 255,
\emph{e.g.} {\tt Colour(border)=\#ffa700}. Within style files, the ``\#''
character is used to introduce a comment, and so the colour code would be
ignored. To avoid this, the ``@'' character can be used in place of ``\#''.

\end{itemize}

If no pen is currently available in the pallette with the requested
colour, then the ``nearest'' colour will be used instead --- sometimes
this may not be very near at all! If you specifically want the requested
colour, then you should use PALENTRY first to set one of the available
pens to the required colour.

Note, if you produce a plot on an X-window and then change the representation 
of pens using PALENTRY, then any components of the existing plot which were
drawn with the modified pens will change colour immediately \emph{if an
only if} your X window is set to 256 colours (i.e. if you have an 8 bit
pseudo-colour visual). If you have a 16 or 24 bit display, then changes
to pen colours will only affect subsequently drawn graphics.

\subsection{Establishing Defaults for Plotting Attributes}

When an application needs a plotting style, it uses a style parameter
to get a group of attribute settings. But what values are used for
attributes which are not included in this group?

Obviously, if an attribute has been assigned an explicit value using the
parameter then that value is used, but you should note that styles are
``sticky''. That is, once a group of attribute settings has been
specified for a style parameter, that group continues to be used by
subsequent applications until a new group is supplied for the parameter.
If the group is supplied within a text file, then the ``current value''
stored for the parameter is the list of attribute settings read from the
file, \emph{not} the name of the file. Thus, changing the contents of the
file at a later time will have no effect on the value used for the
parameter unless you re-specify the parameter on the command line.

If an attribute is not specified in the supplied group, then a default
value is used for the attribute, determined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If the plot is being overlayed on another existing plot, then the
      value which was used for the attribute when the existing plot was
      created is used (but only if it was set to an explicit value).

\item Otherwise, the attribute value specified in a ``defaults file'' is
      used. The defaults file is found as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If the environment variable {\tt KAPPA\_<APP>\_<PARAM>} is defined (where
      {\tt <APP>} is the name of the application {\it e.g.} DISPLAY, and 
      {\tt <PARAM>} is the name of the parameter, {\it e.g.} STYLE, both
      in upper-case), its value is taken to be the full path to 
      the defaults file. 

\item If {\tt KAPPA\_<APP>\_<PARAM>} is not defined, the file {\tt 
      \$HOME/kappa\_<app>\_<param>.def} is used (where {\tt <app>} and
      {\tt <param>} are in lower case this time). 
   
\item If the file {\tt \$HOME/kappa\_<app>\_<param>.def} cannot be accessed, 
      the file {\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/kappa\_<app>\_<param>.def} is used.

\item If the file {\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/kappa\_<app>\_<param>.def} cannot be 
      accessed, then the value of the environment variable 
      {\tt KAPPA\_<PARAM>} is used as the full path to the defaults file. 
   
\item If {\tt KAPPA\_<PARAM>} is not defined, the file {\tt 
      \$HOME/kappa\_<param>.def} is used.
   
\item If the file {\tt \$HOME/kappa\_<param>.def} cannot be accessed, the file
      {\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/kappa\_<param>.def} is used.
\end{itemize}

\item If the above process failed to produce a value for the attribute
(either because no file was found, or the file did not contain a setting
for the attribute), then the default value supplied by the AST library is 
used. These defaults are included in the full description of the relevant
attributes later in this section.

\end{enumerate}

From the above, you can see that defaults can be specified either for 
individual applications, or for all applications (any application-specific 
defaults file will be used in preference to the general defaults file).

It should be remembered that settings for unknown attributes are ignored,
and do not cause the application to abort.\footnote{This is because they
may be synonyms recognised by other other applications.} So if you set a
value for an attribute and it seems to have no effect, it may be worth
checking that you have used the correct spelling for the attribute name.

\subsection{Descriptions of Plotting Attributes}

This section lists the available plotting attributes. Note, the default
value included in each description is the value which will be used if no
other default value is supplied (for instance within a defaults file).
In particular, the standard {\footnotesize KAPPA} default style files
contained in \$KAPPA\_DIR include alternative default values for several
attributes which will be used in preference to those described below.

Individual applications may over-ride the normal behaviour of
particular attributes, in which case the description of the application
will include details.

It is often useful to specify values for some of the attributes of the current
Frame when giving a plotting style (title, axis labels, {\it etc}). These
additional attributes are described \hyperref{here}{in section }{}{se:frmatt}.

\sstroutine{

      If the {\tt Border} value of a plot is non-zero, then this border will
      be drawn as part of the axes. Otherwise, the border is not drawn
      (although axis labels and tick marks will still appear, unless
      other relevant attributes indicate that they should
      not). The default behaviour is to draw the border if tick marks
      and numerical labels will be drawn around the edges of the
      plotting area (see the {\tt Labelling} attribute), but to omit it

      (optionally using a ``@'' inplace of a ``\#'' to avoid the code

      This attribute controls the appearance of annotated axes by determining

      specifies where the numerical labels and tick marks for the
      second axis should be drawn.

      For each axis, the {\tt LabelAt} value gives the value on the other
      axis at which numerical labels and tick marks should be placed.
      For example, in a celestial (RA,Dec) co-ordinate
      system, {\tt LabelAt(1)} gives a Dec value which defines a line (of
      constant Dec) along which the numerical RA labels and their
      associated tick marks will be drawn. Similarly, {\tt LabelAt(2)} gives
      the RA value at which the Dec labels and ticks will be drawn.

\section{\xlabel{se_datastr}Data structures\label{se:datastr}}

In an ideal world you would not need to know how your data are stored. It
would be transparent. Starlink applications attempt to achieve this
through standard, but extensible, data structures, and the ability to
apparently operate on other formats through the so-called
\htmlref{`on-the-fly conversion'}{se:autoconvert} (see
\latexonly{Section~\ref{se:autoconvert} and} \xref{SUN/55}{sun55}{}).

The official standard data format used by Starlink applications is the
\NDFextref{NDF}\ (Extensible $N$-dimensional Data Format, SUN/33).  The
data in an NDF is stored using \HDSref\ which has numerous advantages,
not least that {\em HDS files are portable between operating systems};
both have file extension {\tt .sdf}.

The NDF has been carefully designed to facilitate processing by both
general applications like {\footnotesize KAPPA} and specialist packages.
It contains an $n$-dimensional data array that can store most
astronomical data such as spectra, images and spectral-line data cubes.
The NDF may also contain other items such as a title, axis labels and
units, error and quality arrays, and World Co-ordinate System (WCS)
information.  There are also places in the NDF, called {\em extensions},
to store any ancillary data associated with the data array, even other
NDFs.

The NDF format and its components are described more fully in
\latexelsehtml{Appendices~\ref{ap:NDFformat},}{\htmlref{NDF standard components}
{ap:NDFformat},}  which includes commands for manipulating the components.  

The NDF format permits arrays to have seven dimensions, but some
applications only handle one-dimensional and/or two-dimen\-sional data
arrays.  The data and variance arrays are not constrained to a single
data type.  Valid types are the \htmlref{HDS numeric primitive
types}{ap:HDStypes}\latexonly{, see Appendix~\ref{ap:HDStypes}}.

Many applications are generic, that is they can work on all or some of
these data types directly.  This makes these applications faster, since
there is no need to make a copy of the data converted to the type
supported by the application.  If an application is not generic it only
processes {\_REAL} data.   Look in the {\tt Implementation Status} in
the help or the reference manual.  If none is given you can assume that
processing will occur in \_REAL.

In {\footnotesize KAPPA} the elements of the data array are often called 
\htmlref{{\em pixels}}{se:pixelindices}, even if the NDF is not
two-dimensional.

\subsection{Looking at the Data Structures}

You can look at a summary of an \NDFref{NDF}\ structure using the task
\htmlref{NDFTRACE}{NDFTRACE}, and obtain the values of NDF extension
components with the {\tt \htmlref{setext}{SETEXT} option=get} command.
\HDSTRACEref\ \latexonly{(SUN/102)} can be used to look at array values and
extensions.

\subsection{Editing the Data Structures}
There are facilities for editing \HDSref\ components, though these should be
used with care, lest you invalidate the file.  For instance, if you
were to erase the DATA\_ARRAY component of an \NDFref{NDF}, the file would no
longer be regarded as an NDF by applications software.

In {\footnotesize KAPPA}, \htmlref{ERASE}{ERASE} will let you remove any
component from within an HDS container file, but you have to know the
full path to the component.  \htmlref{SETEXT}{SETEXT} has options to
erase extensions and their contents, without needing to know how these
are stored within the HDS file.  It also permits you to create and
rename extension components, and assign new values to existing
components.  There are a number of commands for manipulating
FITS-header information stored in the NDF's FITS extension. These are
described in
\latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:fitsairlock}.}{\htmlref{the FITS
airlock}{se:fitsairlock}.}

\Figaroref\ offers some additional tasks (\xref{CREOBJ}{sun86}{CREOBJ},
\xref{DELOBJ}{sun86}{DELOBJ}, and \xref{RENOBJ}{sun86}{RENOBJ}) for
editing HDS components.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_native}Native Format\label{se:native}}

Although \HDSref\ files are portable you are recommended to copy them to
the host machine, and run application \htmlref{NATIVE}{NATIVE} on them
for efficiency gains.  NATIVE converts the data to the native format of
the machine on which you issue the command. If you don't do this, every
time you access the data in your \NDFref{NDF}, this conversion
process occurs. NATIVE also replaces any IEEE
floating point NaN or Inf values with the appropriate Starlink bad value.
The following converts all the HDS files in the current directory.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % native "*"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\section{\xlabel{se_ndfsect}NDF Sections\label{se:ndfsect}}

You will frequently want to examine or process only a portion of your
dataset, be it to focus on a given object in an image, or a single
spectrum between nominated wavelengths, or a plane of a cube.  You
could use \htmlref{NDFCOPY}{NDFCOPY} or \htmlref{MANIC}{MANIC} in some
circumstances to make a new NDF containing the required data, but this
would be inconvenient as you would need more disc space, and to invent
and remember a new filename. 
You will be pleased to learn that there is a succinct and
powerful alternative that obviates the need to create a new file---the
NDF section.  The application just processes a `rectangular' subset,
or section, of the NDF that you nominate.  Certainly, it requires you
to learn a little syntax, but after you use it a few times it will
seem cheap at the price for the advantages it offers.

An NDF section is defined by specifying the bounds of the portion of
the NDF to be processed immediately following the name of the NDF.
You can do this in any place where an NDF name alone would suffice,
for example, on the command line or in response to a prompt or as a
default in an interface file.  The syntax is a series of subscripts
within parentheses and may be given in several ways.  Here is a simple
example.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> stats cluster(101:200,51:150)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This would derive statistics of a 100$\times$100-pixel region
starting at pixel indices (101,~51) in the NDF called cluster.
Alternatively, ranges of axis co-ordinates may be given instead of
pixel indices.  Besides giving lower and upper bounds as above, you may
specify a centre and extent.  Sections are not limited to
subsets---supersets are allowed.  See the paragraphs below for more
details of these features.

If you {\em do\/} want to make a new NDF from a portion of an existing one,
you should use the command NDFCOPY.  An NDF's shape may be changed
{\it in situ\/} by \htmlref{SETBOUND}{SETBOUND}.

{\em Note if you supply an NDF section on a C-shell command line,
you must escape the parentheses.}  For example, the following
are both equivalent to the earlier example.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % stats cluster"(101:200,51:150)"
     % stats cluster\(101:200,51:150\)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize



\subsection{\xlabel{se_ndfsec-bounds}Specifying Lower and Upper Bounds
\label{se:ndfsec-bounds}}

The subscript expression appended to an NDF name to specify a section
may be given in several ways. One possible method (corresponding with
the example above) is to give the lower and upper bounds in each
dimension, as follows

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\tt NAME( a:b, c:d, ... )}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

where `{\tt a:b}', `{\tt c:d}', ({\it etc.}) specify the lower and upper
bounds. The bounds specified need not necessarily lie within the actual
bounds of the NDF, because \htmlref{{\em bad\/} pixels}{se:masking} 
\latexonly{(see Section~\ref{se:masking})} will be supplied in the
usual way, if required, to pad out the NDF's array components whenever
they are accessed. However, none of the lower bounds should exceed the
corresponding upper bound. 

Omitting any of the bounds from the subscript expression will cause the
appropriate (lower or upper) bound of the NDF to be used instead. If you
also omit the separating `:', then the lower and upper bounds of the
section will both be set to the same value, so that a single pixel will
be selected for that dimension. Omitting the bounds entirely for a
dimension (but still retaining the comma) will cause the entire extent
of that dimension to be used. Thus, 

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\tt IMAGE(,64)}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

could be used to specify row 64 of a 2-dimensional image, while

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\tt CUBE( 1, 257:, 100 )}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

would specify column 1, pixels 257 onwards, selected from plane number
100 of a 3-dimensional `data cube', forming a one-dimensional section.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_ndfsec-cenext}Specifying Centre and Extent
\label{se:ndfsec-cenext}}

An alternative form for the subscript expression involves specifying the
centre and extent of the region required along each dimension, as
follows

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\tt NAME( p}$\sim${\tt q, r}$\sim${\tt s, ... )}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

where `{\tt p}$\sim${\tt q}', `{\tt r}$\sim${\tt s}', ({\it etc.})
specify the centre and extent. Thus, 

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\tt NAME(100}$\sim${\tt 11,200}$\sim${\tt 5)}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

would refer to an 11$\times$5-pixel region of an image centred on pixel
(100,~200).

If the value before the delimiting `$\sim$' is omitted, it will default
to the index of the central pixel in that dimension (rounded downwards
if there are an even number of pixels). If the value following the
`$\sim$' is omitted, it will default to the number of pixels in that
dimension. Thus, 

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\tt IMAGE( }$\sim${\tt 100, }$\sim${\tt 100)}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

could be used to refer to a 100$\times$100-pixel region located
centrally within an image, while 

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\tt IMAGE( 10}$\sim${\tt , 20}$\sim$ {\tt )}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

would specify a section which is the same size as the original image, but
displaced so that it is centred on pixel (10,~20).

\subsection{\xlabel{se_ndfsec-axis}Using Axis Co-ordinates to Specify Sections
\label{se:ndfsec-axis}}

A further variation is that numerical values in subscript expressions
may be specified either as integers, in which case they refer to pixel
indices, or as floating-point numbers, in which case they refer to
{\em axis\/} co-ordinates 
\latexelsehtml{(for a description of {\em AXIS\/} co-ordinates, see
Section~\ref{se:domains}).}{(see \htmlref{``Co-ordinate Frames, Axes and
Domains''}{se:domains} for a description).}  Here a
``floating-point'' number is one containing a decimal point and/or an
exponent.  Double-precision arithmetic is used to process these
values, but either double- or single-precision notation may be used
when supplying them.  Both linear and non-linear {\em axis\/}
co-ordinates are supported, the values supplied being automatically
converted into the corresponding pixel indices before use. For
instance,

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\tt SPECTRUM(6500.0:7250.0)}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

could be used to select the appropriate region of a spectrum calibrated
in {\AA}ngstroms, while

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\tt SPECTRUM(6000.0}$\sim${\tt 500.0)}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

would select a region of the spectrum approximately from 5750 to 
6250.0~{\AA}ngstroms (the exact extent depending the values of the
axis co-ordinates), and

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\tt SPECTRUM(5500.0}$\sim${\tt 21)}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

would select a 21-pixel-wide region of the spectrum centred on
5500~{\AA}ngstroms.

Command \htmlref{NDFTRACE}{NDFTRACE} will show whether or not an NDF
has axis co-ordinates, and if so, it reports their extents.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_ndfsec-dim}Changing Dimensionality
\label{se:ndfsec-dim}}

The number of dimensions given when specifying an NDF section need not
necessarily correspond with the actual number of NDF dimensions,
although usually it will do so. 

If you specify fewer dimensions than there are NDF dimensions, then
any unspecified bounds will be set to (1:1) for the purposes of
identifying the pixels to which the section should refer. Conversely, if
extra dimensions are given, then the shape of the NDF will be padded
with extra bounds set to (1:1) in order to match the number of
dimensions. In all cases, the resulting section will have the number of
dimensions you have actually specified, the padding serving only to
identify the pixels to which the section should refer. 

In {\footnotesize KAPPA} there are a number of applications that can only
handle a fixed number of dimensions ({\it{e.g.}}\
\htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY}, \htmlref{LINPLOT}{LINPLOT},
\htmlref{MEDIAN}{MEDIAN}).  NDF sections permit such applications to
have wider applicability, since the applications can operate on full
NDFs of arbitrary dimensionality.  So for instance, DISPLAY could show
planes of a datacube.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_ndfsec-mixing}Mixing Bounds Expressions
\label{se:ndfsec-mixing}}

In the \htmlref{last example}{se:ndfsec-axis}
\latexonly{ (in Section~\ref{se:ndfsec-axis})} both {\em axis\/}
co-ordinates and pixel indices were mixed in the same subscript
expression. In fact, any of the features described earlier may be
combined when specifying an NDF section, the only restriction being that
when the shape of the resulting section is expressed in pixel indices,
the lower bound must not exceed the upper bound in any dimension. Thus,
all the following might be used as valid specifications for NDF
sections 

\small
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
{\tt NDF(3.7)}\\
{\tt NDF(,5:)}\\
{\tt NDF(-77:13.8,,4)}\\
{\tt NDF(66}$\sim${\tt 9,4:17)}\\
{\tt NDF(}$\sim${\tt 5,6}$\sim${\tt )}\\
{\tt NDF(}$\sim${\tt ,:)}\\
{\tt NDF(5500.0}$\sim${\tt 150,)}\\
{\tt NDF(3.0}$\sim${\tt 1.5,-78.06D-3:13.0545,,,,)}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

Many other combinations are obviously possible.

\section{\xlabel{se_ndfhistory}NDF History\label{se:ndfhistory}}

During a spring clean of directories to free some space (what d'
y'mean you don't?), most of us will have encountered data files whose
purpose and worth are long forgotten. We're reluctant to remove them
in case they contain irreplaceable data. Some people are very good and
make copious notes\ldots Even then the result of a casual experiment
might not be recorded.  For those who are lazy, such files can be a
frequent dilemma.  Even a quick look at a plot of the data is often
of little assistance.  As you've probably surmised, the
\NDFextref{NDF}\ offers a solution.

Within an NDF you may record {\em history\/} information.  This is
usually a chronicle of the processing stages used to form the NDF, 
including the parameter values of the applications invoked; but it may
also include commentary you provide, for example, the rationale for
doing certain operations.

History is associated with individual NDFs; it is not some global
attribute of a data-processing session.  An NDF has a {\em history
update mode}, which remains with the NDF and any descendant NDF, until
the update mode is altered or the history erased.  By default, the update
mode is {\tt "Disabled"}, meaning that no history recording occurs.  To
permit history recording you must first switch it on, selecting from
three update modes---{\tt "Quiet"}, {\tt "Normal"}, and {\tt
"Verbose"}---which give increasingly more detailed information.
% There are some examples below, for you to gauge which is appropriate.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_conhistory}Control and Content of History Recording
\label{se:conhistory}}

Task \htmlref{HISSET}{HISSET} lets you set the history update mode.
The default is {\tt "Normal"}, thus here the command

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hisset hr1068
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
switches normal history recording on for NDF hr1068.  Thereafter
whenever you alter this NDF, or create another NDF from it,
the task automatically records the name of the application which was
run, the date and time, a reference name that identifies the NDF, your
username, and some text comprising the command-line parameters and the
full path of the application.  In {\footnotesize KAPPA} the package 
name and version is appended to the application name. Other packages 
may provide task-dependent additional text. 

If disc space is not a concern, you might prefer the verbose level.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hisset hr1068 verbose
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
the supplementary information being the machine type, and its operating
system name and version.

For small datasets, such as spectra, the history can amount to a
significant part of the NDF's size, so for these you might prefer
the quiet level.  This does not record the command line.

HISSET lets you switch off history recording, if you want to do
something `off the record', or erase the history altogether.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hisset hr1068 disabled
     % hisset hr1068 erase
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{\xlabel{se_commenthistory}Adding Commentary to History Recording
\label{se:commenthistory}}

Once history recording is enabled, you can add commentary to an
NDF using \htmlref{HISCOM}{HISCOM}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hiscom hr1068 i "There may have been cloud during the integration."
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
You aren't limited to single lines if you respond to the prompt for 
the comment.  You can give a series of lines, terminated by supplying
{\tt !}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hiscom hr1068
     COMMENT - Comment line > The dome may have been obstructing the telescope 
     COMMENT - Comment line > during the integration.  We are not sure that the
     COMMENT - Comment line > filter is correct either.
     COMMENT - Comment line > !
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

If you prefer, you may edit some text into a file and append its
contents to the history records.  Thus

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hiscom hr1068 f file=comments.lis
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
appends the text contained in {\tt comments.lis} to the history
records of NDF hr1068.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_listhistory}Listing History Records
\label{se:listhistory}}

At some point you will want to refer back to the history records.
The \htmlref{HISLIST}{HISLIST} task does this.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hislist hr1068

        History listing for NDF structure /home/scratch/dro/hr1068:

        History structure created 1995 Sep 24 11:16:15.000

        Parameters: MODE='Normal' NDF=@hr1068
        Software: /star/bin/kappa/hisset
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Before you ask\ldots at present there are no parameters for selecting a
time interval and there is no output of the machine and username, but
they're not forgotten.

Here is another example showing a series of history records.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hislist hr1068 \\

        History listing for NDF structure /home/scratch/dro/hr1068sm2:

        The dome may have been obstructing the telescope during the integration.
        We are not sure that the filter is correct either.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The first history item shows HISSET enabling history.  This was followed by
a smooth of the data with \htmlref{GAUSMOOTH}{GAUSMOOTH}.  Then the
recording level was set to verbose.  The fourth record recalls another
smooth, and this time you can see the machine details.  Finally, some
commentary is added with HISCOM.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{se_agitate}The Graphics Database\label{se:agitate}}

Have you ever been in a situation where you would like an application to
know about graphics drawn by some other programme?  For instance, you
display an image of the sky, then later you want to obtain the
co-ordinates of the stars within the image via the cursor.  There are
two main approaches to achieving this functionality.  The first is to
duplicate the display code in the cursor application.  This is
wasteful and inflexible.  The second is to store information about
{\em pictures\/} in a database that can be accessed by subsequent graphics
programmes.  This is the technique used by {\footnotesize KAPPA}.

Each graphics application which creates a display on a graphics device,
also stores information describing the display in the \emph{graphics
database}. This is a file which usually resides in the user's home
directory, and is often referred to as the ``AGI
database.''\footnote{``AGI'' is the name of the subroutine library which
provides access to the graphics database. AGI stands for ``Applications Graphics
Interface'', and is documented in \xref{SUN/48}{sun48}{}.} Displays are
described in terms of \emph{pictures}. A picture is basically a
rectangular area on the graphics device within which an application
produces graphical output. Each time an application creates a picture,
the dimensions and position of the picture (together with other ancillary
information) are stored in the graphics database. Subsequent applications
can then read this information back from the database, and use it (for
instance) to align new graphics with previously displayed graphics.

The best way to demonstrate the use of the graphics database is to give 
some illustrated examples.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_agiaction}The Graphics Database in Action\label{se:agiaction}}

The following examples assume that {\footnotesize KAPPA} is loaded and
the graphics device---an X-window containing a plotting area of 850 by 500 
pixels---is available.  To create such a window use the {\tt xmake}
(\xref{SUN/130}{sun130}{}) command:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % xmake xwindows -height 500 -width 850 -colours 64 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This command limits the number of colours used by the X-window to
64. It is usually a good idea to be sparing with X-window colours.
Creating X-windows with too many colours can restrict the availability of
colours for other X applications.

First of all we make the X-window the current graphics device 
(as described in \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:devglobal}).}{in
\htmlref{global device names}{se:devglobal}.)}  This selection will remain in force
until changed.  The following command would not be necessary if the
global parameter already had this value:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % gdset xwindows
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Next we shall clear the X-window, and empty the graphics database
of xwindows pictures (pictures relating to other graphics 
devices are retained):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % gdclear
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The display is now clear, but one picture remains in the graphics
database; this is the BASE picture and corresponds to the entire
plotting area. To understand why this BASE picture is required we need to
introduce the idea of the \emph{current picture}.

At any time, one of the pictures stored within the graphics database is
nominated as the \emph{current picture}. All graphical applications are
written so that the graphical output which they create is scaled to fit
within the current picture. Thus, the plotting area used by a graphics
application can be controlled by selecting a suitable current picture
before running the application. Since we have just cleared the database,
the only picture remaining is the BASE picture, which consequently
becomes the current picture. This allows subsequent applications to draw
in any part of the plotting area.

We now load a grey-scale colour table into the X-windows and display an
IRAS 12 $\mu$m image of M31. The pixel values are scaled so that 10 \% of
the pixels appear as pure black, and 1 \% appear as pure white. We ensure
that no annotated axes are produced (this will result in the image being
a little larger since no margins need to be left for the axes):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % lutgrey
     % display $KAPPA_DIR/iras noaxes 
     MODE - Method to define the scaling limits /'FLASH'/ > perc
     PERCENTILES - Percentiles for scaling /[10,90]/ > 10,99
     Data will be scaled from 0.05178363 to 1.051904.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\begin{latexonly}
   \begin{figure}[hbt]
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[clip,height=110mm]{sun95_gd1.eps}
   \caption{An IRAS 12 $\mu$m image of M31 displayed in the middle of the BASE picture.}
   \label{fi:agi1}
   \end{center}
   \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}

\begin{htmlonly}
   \label{fi:agi1}
   \htmladdimg{sun95_gd1.gif}

   Figure 1: An IRAS 12 micron image of M31 displayed in the middle of the BASE picture.
\end{htmlonly}

The X-window should now look like Figure~
\latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi1}}{1}. The application has displayed the
image in the middle of the current picture (the BASE picture), and has made 
it as large as possible, subject to the constraints that it must lie entirely 
within the current picture. Note, as with many IRAS images, equatorial
north is downwards in this image

Let's now use the \htmlref{PICLIST}{PICLIST} command to look at the contents 
of the graphics database (press return in response for the prompt for 
parameter PICNUM):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % piclist

       No. Name             Comment                   Label            Ref
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
     C   1 BASE             Base picture
         2 DATA             KAPPA_DISPLAY                              Ref
     PICNUM - Number of new current picture /!/ > 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This shows us that there are now two pictures in the database, listed in
the order in which they were created. The current picture is still the
base picture, as indicated by the letter {\tt C} at the left of the line
describing picture number 1. The second picture was created by the
{\footnotesize KAPPA} application DISPLAY, and has the name ``DATA'',
indicating that it contains a representation of a set of data values.
DATA is one of four standard picture \emph{names}. BASE is another of
these standard names. We shall come across the other two shortly. The
PICLIST application allows you to select a new current picture by
supplying a picture number in response to the prompt for parameter
PICNUM. Accepting the null default by pressing return causes the current
picture on entry to be retained.

The above use of \htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY} illustrates an important 
rule regarding the behaviour of most graphical applications; {\em the
current picture is not changed by applications which produce graphical
output}.\footnote{This rule does not apply to applications which 
manage the database itself rather than producing graphical output. Thus,
for instance, it is legal for PICLIST to change the current picture if
you request such a change. Also, an uncontrolled exit from an application,
{\it{e.g.}}\ {\tt CTRL/C} may leave the database in an abnormal state.}
If it were not for this rule, pictures would become progressively
smaller, vanishing into the distance, since new pictures cannot be
drawn outside the current picture.  

We will now display an optical image of M31. This time we will arrange
for it to be placed towards the left hand side of the X-window. To do this,
we first clear the whole X-window and graphics database using
\htmlref{GDCLEAR}{GDCLEAR}:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % gdclear
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We now create a new picture using the \htmlref{PICDEF}{PICDEF} command
(note, the ``\verb+\+'' characters are needed to prevent the Unix shell
interpreting the square bracket characters):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % picdef mode=cl fraction=\[0.6,1.0\] outline=no
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The MODE parameter specifies the position of the new picture within the
BASE picture; in this case ``cl'' indicates that the new picture is to be
centred (``c'') vertically within the BASE picture and placed at the left
(``l'') hand edge. The FRACTION parameter specifies the dimensions of the
picture; the first value (0.6) gives the horizontal size of the picture
as a fraction of the horizontal size of the BASE picture, and the second
value (1.0) gives the vertical size of the picture as a fraction of the
vertical size of the BASE picture. Thus, the new picture is just over
half the width of the BASE picture, and is the full height of the BASE
picture. The OUTLINE parameter specifies whether a box should be drawn on
the screen showing the outline of the new picture. In this case we switch
this option off.

If we run PICLIST again, we get:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % piclist

       No. Name             Comment                   Label            Ref
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
         1 BASE             Base picture
     C   2 FRAME            KAPPA_PICDEF
     PICNUM - Number of new current picture /!/ > 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The picture created earlier by DISPLAY was deleted when we ran GDCLEAR.
The BASE picture is still there (of course), and we also have the picture
created by PICDEF. This is a FRAME picture, another of the four standard
picture names. A FRAME picture acts as a ``frame'' for other pictures. A
FRAME picture can itself contain other nested FRAME pictures, together
with DATA and KEY pictures. The picture created by PICDEF is the current
picture (indicated by the letter {\tt C} again), and so subsequent
graphics applications will arrange for any pictures they create to fall
entirely within this FRAME picture.

Now display the image, this time including annotated axes around the
edges.\footnote{The current co-ordinate Frame in the image being used is
RA/DEC and so the axis will be annotated in RA and DEC.} DISPLAY will
ensure that all its output (both the image and the axis annotation) fall
within the current picture ({\it i.e.}\ the picture created by PICDEF above). We
scale the pixel values to produce a negative image in which 1 \% of
the pixels appear black and 30 \% appear white:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % display axes
     IN - NDF to be displayed /@$KAPPA_DIR/iras/ > $KAPPA_DIR/m31
     MODE - Method to define scaling limits /'perc'/ >
     PERCENTILES - Percentiles for scaling /[10,99]/ > 99,30
     Data will be scaled from 10854.78 to 3889.016.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\begin{latexonly}
   \begin{figure}[hbt]

The X-window should now look like Figure~
\latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi2}}{2}. We can use \htmlref{PICLIST}{PICLIST} 
again to list the pictures stored in the database:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % piclist
       No. Name             Comment                   Label            Ref
       -------------------------------------------------------------------

     PICNUM - Number of new current picture /!/ > 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

There are four pictures this time; the BASE picture, the picture created
by \htmlref{PICDEF}{PICDEF} (number 2), and two pictures created by
\htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY} (numbers 3 and 4). Picture number 2 was made the
current picture by \htmlref{PICDEF}{PICDEF}, and as explained above, 
\htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY} did not change this. DISPLAY creates two
pictures, one (the DATA picture) containing just the image area itself,
and another (the FRAME picture) to act as a frame for the DATA picture
and the annotated axes. 

Let's say you wanted to display an enlarged sub-section of the image in
the top right corner of the X-window. First, you need to decide on the
bounds of the sub-section to be displayed. Here, we use a graphics cursor to 
indicate the bottom left and top right corners of a box enclosing the
required area. Click the left mouse button at the bottom left and top
right corners of a box enclosing the required sub-section of the image:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % cursor showpixel plot=box maxpos=2

       Use the cursor to select up to 2 positions to be reported.
         To select a position press the space bar or left mouse button
         To forget the previous position press "d" or the middle mouse button
         To quit press "." or the right mouse button

      Picture comment: KAPPA_DISPLAY, name: DATA, reporting: SKY co-ordinates

The box I selected is indicated in Figure~ \latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi3}}{3}. 

When an application such as DISPLAY produces a DATA picture containing a
representation of an NDF, it saves a copy of the NDF's WCS component
(which contains co-ordinate Frame information) with the DATA picture in
the graphics database. When \htmlref{CURSOR}{CURSOR} subsequently reports
a position, it uses this saved WCS information to convert the graphics
co-ordinates at the cursor into any of the available co-ordinate Frames.
By default, CURSOR reports positions in the co-ordinate Frame which was
current when the NDF was displayed (RA/DEC in this case), but other
co-ordinate Frames may be requested using the FRAME parameter ({\it e.g.}\ 
FRAME=PIXEL displays pixel co-ordinates). In addition to the co-ordinate
Frames inherited from the NDF, there are also three extra Frames available:

\begin{description}

\item [GRAPHICS] -- specifies positions in terms of millimetres
from the bottom left corner of the graphics device ({\it e.g.}\ X-window or
paper).

\item [BASEPIC] -- similar to GRAPHICS but specifies positions in a
normalised co-ordinate system in which the shorter dimension of the
screen or paper has a length of 1.0 (the scales on both axes are equal).

\item [NDC] -- similar to BASEPIC but specifies positions in a
normalised co-ordinate system in which the bottom left corner has
co-ordinates (0,0) and the top right corner has co-ordinates (1,1).
Thus, for a non-square device the scales on the two axes will be different.

\item [CURPIC] -- similar to BASEPIC except that it covers only the
specified picture. Thus, the bottom left corner of the each picture is 
at $(0,0)$ and the shorter dimension of each picture has length 1.0.

\end{description}

Going through the parameters supplied to the above CURSOR command, the
first one (SHOWPIXEL) causes the pixel co-ordinates at each selected
position to be displayed, in addition to the co-ordinates selected using
parameter FRAME (which defaults in this case to RA/DEC since FRAME was
not specified). For instance, the first position is at an RA of $0^{h}
41^{m} 33.5^{s}$ and a Dec of $40^{\dgs} 33^{\arcm} 01^{\arcsec}$, and has pixel
co-ordinates $(172.4,78.2)$.\footnote{Pixel \emph{co-ordinates} are
fractional, where-as pixel \emph{indices} are integer. The pixel with
indices $(1,1)$ covers a range of pixel co-ordinates between $0.0$ and
$1.0$ on each axis, with its centre at pixel co-ordinates $(0.5,0.5)$.}
The second parameter (PLOT=BOX) causes a box to be drawn on the
screen between each pair of positions. There are several other allowed
values for the PLOT parameter which mark the positions in different ways
(markers, poly-lines, chains, text, {\it etc}). The last parameter (MAXPOS=2) 
is purely a convenience, and causes the application to
terminate when two positions have been supplied. Without this, you would
need to press the right mouse button once the two positions had been
given to indicate that you do not want to supply any more positions.

We now need to create a new FRAME picture to contain the magnified image
section. We have
seen how PICDEF can be used to create a FRAME picture of a given size at
a given position within the BASE picture, but there are also several
other ways in which PICDEF can be used. Here, we use PICDEF in ``cursor''
mode; the bottom left and top right corners of the new picture are
specified by pointing and clicking with the mouse.\footnote{Note, by
default, the FRAME picture created by PICDEF is \emph{not} constrained to be
within the current picture, it can be anywhere within the BASE picture.}
We use this mode to create a new FRAME picture occupying the area to the
top right of the existing image:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % picdef mode=cursor nooutline

       Use the cursor to select 2 distinct points.
         To select a point press the space bar or left mouse button
         To quit press "." or the right mouse button
     
     Co-ordinates are ( 0.9155139, 0.5470942 ) and ( 1.683106, 0.9799599 )

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The co-ordinates displayed by PICDEF are BASEPIC co-ordinates.

We now display the required image section in this new FRAME picture. The
screen output from CURSOR above shows that the selected image section
runs from pixel 173 to 213 on the first (X) axis, and from pixel 79 to
114 on the second (Y) axis. To display just this section we include the
pixel bounds in the specification of the input NDF when we run DISPLAY:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % display border noaxes mode=scale high=3889.016 low=10854.78
     IN - NDF to be displayed /@m31/ > m31(173:213,79:114)
     Data will be scaled from 10854.78 to 3889.016.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\begin{latexonly}

The X-window should now look like Figure~ \latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi4}}{4}. 

The string \verb+m31(173:213,79:114)+ is called an \emph{NDF section
specifier}. These are described more fully \hyperref{here}{in section }
{}{se:ndfsect}. The image is surrounded by a thin border instead of fully
annotated axes in order to make the image larger. This is achieved using
the BORDER and NOAXES keywords (equivalent to setting BORDER=YES and 
AXES=NO). The pixel scaling was specified explicitly using parameters HIGH
and LOW in order to ensure that the image was displayed with the same
grey-scale as the main image (the high and low data values are the data
values corresponding to black and white --- or white and black if reversed
-- and were reported when the main image was displayed earlier).

Remember the IRAS image of M31 we started with? We'll now overlay
contours of the IRAS image on top of the magnified section of the visual
image we have just displayed. Don't forget, these two images have not
been aligned --- for instance, north is up in the visual image, but down
in the IRAS image. However, both images have information within the WCS
component describing the relationship between pixel co-ordinates and
RA/DEC. This WCS information was stored with the DATA picture created by
DISPLAY above, and so can be used by the \htmlref{CONTOUR}{CONTOUR}
application in order to draw the IRAS contours in alignment with the
displayed visual image.\footnote{The accuracy of this alignment will
depend on the accuracy of the astrometry information supplied with the
image.} In addition, we also use CURSOR to mark a position with a text
string giving a title for the contour plot:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % contour noclear noaxes nokey iras mode=perc percentiles=\[55,75,95\] 
     Alignment has occurred within the SKY Domain.

     Contour heights used:
     0.5499523,   0.7577766,   1.012756.

     % cursor plot=text maxpos=1 minpos=1 strings='"IRAS 12 \gmm contours"'

     Use the cursor to select 1 position to be reported.
       To select a position press the space bar or left mouse button
       To quit press "." or the right mouse button

\end{htmlonly}

The X-window should now look like Figure~ \latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi5}}{5}. 

The most important parameter in the above invocation of CONTOUR is the
NOCLEAR keyword (equivalent to CLEAR=NO). This tells CONTOUR not to clear
the graphics device before drawing the contours. Instead, CONTOUR
looks for an existing DATA picture contained within the current picture.
If one is found, then CONTOUR attempts to align the contours using the 
WCS information stored with the existing DATA picture. In our case, the
current picture is still the top right FRAME picture created by PICDEF,
and so the contours are aligned using the WCS information stored with the 
DATA picture contained within this FRAME picture ({\it i.e.}\ the magnified image 
section). CONTOUR tells us that this alignment occurred within the ``SKY
Domain'' --- if either of the two NDFs had not contained a calibration in a
suitable celestial co-ordinate system, then alignment on the sky could
not have been performed. In this case, CONTOUR would have aligned the
contours in the ``PIXEL Domain'' ({\it i.e.}\ in pixel co-ordinates). 

Since we produced no annotated axes, a title string was added using the text
drawing abilities of CURSOR. The pointer was positioned above the contour
plot, and the left button clicked. The specified text string was drawn
centred at this cursor position. Note, the string \verb+\gm+ is a
``PGPLOT escape sequence'' which represents the Greek letter mu
(``$\mu$''). See the PGPLOT manual for a detailed description of the
available escape sequences.

Let's say we wanted to compare the data values in the visual and IRAS 
images along a given line through the magnified sub-section. To do this,
we first use the application \htmlref{PROFILE}{PROFILE} to create a pair
of 1-dimensional NDFs containing the data values along the line in each
of the two images. We then display these 1-dimensional NDFs using
application \htmlref{LINPLOT}{LINPLOT}.  First we choose the line along
which the profiles are to be taken, using CURSOR (again!):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % cursor plot=chain marker=3 style='colour=white' outcat=zz maxpos=2 

     Use the cursor to select up to 2 positions to be reported.
       To select a position press the space bar or left mouse button
       To forget the previous position press "d" or the middle mouse button
       To quit press "." or the right mouse button


     Picture comment: KAPPA_CONTOUR, name: DATA, reporting: SKY co-ordinates
       RA = 0:41:22.7 (hh:mm:ss.s)   Dec = 40:35:12 (ddd:mm:ss)
       (175.8467    81.82527)
      
       RA = 0:39:56.5    Dec = 40:50:27
       (202.917     107.3986)

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The pointer is positioned at the two ends of the required profile, and the
left button clicked at each position. The supplied positions are marked by 
two markers of PGPLOT type 3 (small crosses), and a white line is drawn between
them (forming a ``chain''). The selected positions are written to an
output catalogue stored in file {\tt zz.FIT}. We now sample the data in the
two images along this profile to create a pair of  1-dimensional NDFs
(\verb+m31_prof+ and \verb+iras_prof+):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % profile m31 incat=zz out=m31_prof
       Alignment has occurred within the SKY Domain.
       Profile contains 38 samples.

     % profile iras incat=zz out=iras_prof
       Alignment has occurred within the SKY Domain.
       Profile contains 38 samples.

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We want to draw the two line profiles in a new plot in the clear area at
the bottom right of the X-window. We therefore need to create a new FRAME
picture. This time we use PICDEF in ``XY mode'', in which the bounds of
the new FRAME picture are given explicitly using parameters UBOUND and
LBOUND (we could have used cursor mode again; we use XY mode just to
explore the different possibilities):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % picdef mode=xy lbound=\[0.93,0.03\] ubound=\[1.67,0.54\] nooutline
       Bounds are ( 0, 0 ) and ( 1.701635, 1 )
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The bounds are supplied in the BASEPIC Frame (the bounds reported by the
application are the bounds of the entire BASE picture). The new FRAME
picture is, as usual, made the current picture by PICDEF and so any
subsequent graphics applications will draw in the new FRAME picture.

We now draw the first of the two line profiles:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % linplot m31_prof style='"tickall=0,colour(curve)=black, \
               drawtitle=0,label(2)=DSS data value (black)"'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\begin{latexonly}
   \begin{figure}[hbt]
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[clip,height=110mm]{sun95_gd6.eps}
   \caption{Data trace through the visual image.}

\end{latexonly}

\begin{htmlonly}
   \label{fi:agi6}
   \htmladdimg{sun95_gd6.gif}

   Figure 6: Data trace through the visual image.

\end{htmlonly}

The X-window should now look like Figure~ \latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi6}}{6}. 
The plotting attributes specified by the STYLE parameter do the following;
\verb+tickall=0+ stops tick marks from being drawn on the un-labelled
edges ({\it i.e.}\ the top and right edges); \verb+colour(curve)=black+
specifies that the data curve is to be drawn in black; \verb+drawtitle=0+
prevents a title being drawn at the top of the plot; 
\verb+label(2)=DSS data value (black)+ specifies the textual label for
the left hand edge.

We now draw the second line plot over the top of the first line plot:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % linplot iras_prof noclear noalign style='"edge(2)=r,tickall=0, \
               colour(curve)=white,drawtitle=0, \
               label(2)=IRAS data value (white)"'

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Again, the NOCLEAR keyword prevents LINPLOT from clearing the graphics
device before drawing the new line plot. Instead, the new line plot is
drawn within the same axes as any existing line plot within the current
picture. By default, the new line plot would adopt the bounds of the two 
existing axes. This would be inappropriate in this case since the two
images have very different data scales. To prevent this, we specify
the NOALIGN keyword which causes the default bounds for the new axes to be 
determined from the supplied data instead of the existing line plot. The
STYLE parameter is similar to the previous line plot except that the data
values are annotated on the right hand edge (\verb+edge(2)=r+), the data
curve is drawn in white, and data label is different.

\begin{latexonly}

The X-window should now look like Figure~ \latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi7}}{7}. 

As a final touch, we will add two ``warp'' lines to the display joining
the corners of the box marking the enlarged image area to the
corresponding corners on the enlarged image. CURSOR can be used to draw
these lines, but we need to take a little care. Normally, graphics
produced by CURSOR will be clipped at the edge of the picture in which
the supplied positions fall. In our case, the required lines start in one
picture (the main image display DATA picture), but end in another (the
magnified image DATA picture). To avoid the lines being clipped when they
leave the main image DATA picture, we first ensure that the current
picture is the BASE picture ({\it i.e.}\ the whole screen), and we tell CURSOR
to report positions within the current picture. Normally, CURSOR reports
each position within the most recent picture under the cursor, but
setting parameter MODE=CURRENT when running CURSOR means that the
reported positions always refer to the co-ordinate system of the current
picture. So, first make the BASE picture the current picture. This is
done using PICLIST, remembering that the BASE picture is always picture
number 1:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % piclist picnum=1
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We now run CURSOR to draw the first warp line:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % cursor plot=poly mode=current maxpos=2 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Position the pointer over the top left corner of the black box marking
the selected image section in the main image display, and click the left
button. Then position the pointer over the top left corner of the border
surrounding the enlarged image display, and click again. A line is drawn
between these two points. 

We now run CURSOR again to draw the second warp line:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % cursor plot=poly mode=current maxpos=2 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Point and click over the bottom right corners of the two boxes this time.
The final X-window should look now look like Figure~ 
\latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi8}}{8}.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_agiother}Other Graphics Database Facilities \label{se:agiother}}
Various other facilities related to the graphics database exist as well
as those described in the previous section. This section gives a brief
description of a few more:

\begin{itemize}

\item A ``label'' can be associated with a picture, using application
\htmlref{PICLABEL}. This provides a convenient ``handle'' by which
pictures can be referred to. For instance:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % piclabel fred
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

will give the label FRED to the current picture. This picture could be
made current again at a later time by re-selecting it using
\htmlref{PICSEL}{PICSEL}:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % picsel fred
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Any label associated with a picture is displayed in the list produced by
PICLIST.

\item PICDEF has one further mode---Array.  This enables you to create an
$n\times m$ grid of new FRAME pictures.  It also has a mechanism for
labelling all the pictures, so you can easily switch between the
elements of the picture array.  You might use the following command in
a shell script to display a series of up to twelve spectra:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % picdef mode=a prefix=spec xpic=3 ypic=4
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The bottom-left picture would be labelled SPEC1 and the rest are
numbered in sequence from left to right to SPEC12---the top-right
picture.  You'd call \htmlref{PICSEL}{PICSEL} to select each picture
in turn via a {\tt while} loop in a C-shell
script\latexonly{ (see Section~\ref{se:cshscript})}.  Since this is a
common operation a shorthand command, \htmlref{PICGRID}{PICGRID}, is
available.  For instance:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % picgrid 3 4
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

is equivalent to the previous example, except that the pictures are
labelled 1 to 12.

\item You can see that montages of pictures can rapidly be built.
Occasionally, you will want some earlier picture to become the current
picture.  As we've seen, a labelled picture can be recalled via PICSEL,
but not all pictures will be labelled, especially ones with name {\tt
DATA}, because of the rule that applications must not change the
current picture.  Another way to select a new current picture is via
the command \htmlref{PICCUR}{PICCUR}.  It displays a cursor.  Move the
cursor to lie on top of the picture you require and select a point
following the instructions (usually by pressing the left-button of the
mouse), then exit (normally by hitting the right-hand mouse button).
Generally, this will be fine, but you can have cases where one plot is
still visible through a transparent plot drawn subsequently.  If the
later picture extends entirely over the image you require, PICCUR will
not let you access it. The moral is ``be careful when arranging your
pictures''.  A picture may only be partially obscured, so by moving
the cursor around and hitting the left-hand button you can often find
a portion that is topmost. PICCUR reports the name, comment and the
label (if it there is one) of the picture in which the cursor is
located to assist you.  It is usually quite obvious where pictures
begin and end, so in practice it is easier than described here.

\item If you do get lost or forget what and where the current picture is,
the \htmlref{GDSTATE}{GDSTATE} command will come to your rescue.  You can
even plot an outline with the OUTLINE keyword if you can't visualise the
device co-ordinates.  In the following example, the current picture does
not have a label.  If it did this too would be listed by GDSTATE:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % gdstate
 
     Status of the xwindows window graphics device...
 
        The current picture is a FRAME picture.
        Comment: KAPPA_PICDEF
        Current co-ordinate Frame: BASEPIC

     Picture bounds in the BASEPIC Frame:
        Axis 1 (X) : 0.516 to 0.891
        Axis 2 (Y) : 0.010 to 0.605
 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\xlabel{se_agiframes}The Co-ordinate Frames Associated with a
Picture\label{se:agiframes}}

Each picture in the graphics database has associated with it several
co-ordinate Frames. Some of these describe positions within the displayed
data array, and others describe the corresponding positions on the
graphics device. Each Frame is referred to by a \emph{Domain name} (see
\hyperref{here}{section }{}{se:domains} for more information about
co-ordinate Frames and Domains). 

The following Domains may be used to specify positions within any 
picture:

\begin{description}

\item [GRAPHICS] --- This gives positions in millimetres from the bottom
left corner of the graphics device. 

\item [BASEPIC] --- This gives positions within a normalised co-ordinate
system spanning the BASE picture ({\it i.e.} the entire graphics device). The 
units on both axes are set so that either the width or the
height of the graphics device, which-ever is smaller, is set to 1.0
(put another way, a unit square would fit in the picture and span the
shorter axis). The bottom left corner of the graphics device is $(0,0)$.

\item [NDC] -- similar to BASEPIC but specifies positions in a
normalised co-ordinate system in which the bottom left corner has
co-ordinates (0,0) and the top right corner has co-ordinates (1,1).
Thus, for a non-square device the scales on the two axes will be different.

\item [CURPIC] -- similar to BASEPIC except that it covers only the
specified picture. Thus, the bottom left corner of the each picture is 
at $(0,0)$ and the shorter dimension of each picture has length 1.0.

\end{description}

DATA pictures have additional co-ordinate Frames inherited from the
\hyperref{WCS information}{WCS information (see section }{)}{se:wcsuse}
associated with the displayed data. The details of the available Frames
will depend on the application which created the picture and the nature
of the data. For instance, if an image is displayed in which the current
Frame is a SKY Frame (calibrated in RA/DEC for instance), then the
Domains GRID, PIXEL, AXIS and SKY will also be available.

Pictures created by older applications which do not yet support WCS 
information will not have all of these Frames. They will still have
GRAPHICS, BASEPIC, NDC and CURPIC Frames, but the only additional Frames 
will be:

\begin{description}
\item [AGI\_WORLD] - This corresponds to AGI ``world'' co-ordinates. 
\item [AGI\_DATA] - This corresponds to AGI ``data'' co-ordinates. 
\end{description}

The interpretation of both these Frames will depend on the application
which created the picture, and should be described in the associated
documentation. Note, the AGI\_DATA Frame may not always be present. This
again depends on the application.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_agitidy}The Graphics Database File\label{se:agitidy}}

The location of the graphics database file can be controlled by setting the
environment variable AGI\_USER to the desired location.  If AGI\_USER
is undefined, the database file is placed in your home directory.
Thus by default the file is {\tt \$HOME/agi\_}{\it $<$node$>$}{\tt
.sdf}, where you substitute your computer's node name for {\it
$<$node$>$}, {\it{e.g.}}\ {\tt /home/dro/agi\_rlsaxp.sdf}. A new
database is created when you run a graphics application if none exists.
AGI will purge the database for a device if the graph window has
changed size, or if you switch between portrait and landscape formats
for a printer device.

The contents of the graphics database are ephemeral.  Therefore you
should regularly purge the database entries with
\htmlref{GDCLEAR}{GDCLEAR} or delete the database file. 

If a graphics application is aborted abnormally (for instance by pressing 
{\tt CTRL/C}), the graphics database may be corrupted, potentially 
resulting in various forms of peculiar behaviour when subsequent graphics
applications are run. If you get ``strange'' behaviour when running a
graphics application, deleting the graphics database file and starting
again will often cure the problem.


\subsection{\xlabel{se_psfiles}Working With PostScript Files\label{se:psfiles}}
Having produced a pretty picture in an X-window, how do we get it onto a
piece of paper? There are basically two ways. The simplest way is to copy
the pixel values from the X-window into a PostScript file, and then print
the file on a suitable PostScript printer. {\tt GIMP}, or {\tt xv} can be 
used to do this, using the {\tt Grab} and {\tt Save} commands. The figures in
this chapter were created using this method. It's easy --- but the results
only have the resolution of your X screen (typically 72 dots per inch)
which is usually not good enough for general publication.

The second method is more involved, but retains the full resolution of
your PostScript printer (typically 600 dots per inch or more), producing
far superior results. It involves running all the {\footnotesize KAPPA}
applications again, but using a suitable encapsulated PostScript graphics
device instead of the X-windows device used earlier in this chapter.
Each application will then write its graphical output to one or more disk
files. Once all applications have been run, you combine all these
files together using \PSMERGEref\ to create a single PostScript file
containing the entire plot which can be printed or included in another
document. We will look at this method in more detail in the rest of
this section.

\subsubsection{The Choice of Graphics Device}
If you want to combine the results of several applications into a single
plot, you need to specify an \emph{encapsulated} PostScript device.
These differ from normal PostScript files in that they contain information 
which allows them to be included within other PostScript files. The
\htmlref{GDNAMES}{GDNAMES} command displays a list of all the available
graphics devices, together with a brief description of each. This should
enable you to select an appropriate device name.\footnote{Most encapsulated 
PostScript devices start with the string ``{\tt epsf}''.} There may be
various encapsulated PostScript devices available. For instance, you can
choose between colour or monochrome devices, and between portrait or
landscape devices. The choice of colour or monochrome obviously depends
on the printer you will use. The choice of landscape or portrait depends
on the shape of the total plot you are producing --- for tall narrow 
plots choose portrait, for short wide plots choose landscape.\footnote{The 
choice or portrait or landscape may also affect the orientation of the
plot when the resulting PostScript file is included in a document.}

For instance, if you want all applications to write graphical output to 
monochrome landscape encapsulated PostScript files set the graphics
device as follows:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % gdset epsf_l
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsubsection{The PostScript Files}

Having selected a suitable encapsulated PostScript graphics device, each
{\footnotesize KAPPA} application will produce an output file in your
current directory containing PostScript commands. These files can be
examined without needing to be printed by using the {\tt ghostview}
program. By default, the output file will be called {\tt pgplot.ps}. 

\begin{quote}
\emph{ Note, subsequent graphics commands will over-write any file
created by earlier graphics commands. For this reason you should 
rename the output file after running each graphics command. An
alternative approach is to assign a unique value to the DEVICE parameter 
for each graphics command (rather than just allowing it to default to the
value of the global parameter set using GDSET). For instance,
\emph{{\tt DEVICE="epsf\_l;contour.ps"}} would cause the command to write its
output to file {\tt contour.ps}.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Combining the Files into a Single File}
Once all applications have been run, you will have a potentially long
list of PostScript files in your current directory. These need to be
stacked together to produce a single PostScript file which can either be
printed or included in a document. To do this, we use 
PSMERGE as follows\footnote{You can include all the PostScript files,
including any which do not contain any actual drawing commands.}:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % psmerge display.ps contour.ps stars.ps > total.ps
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This stacks the three specified PostScript files into a single file called
{\tt total.ps}. This will be a normal ({\it i.e.} not encapsulated) PostScript
file, so you can print it, but it will be difficult to include it in a
document. If you include the {\tt -e} option when running 
PSMERGE, then an encapsulated PostScript file is created instead:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % psmerge -e display.ps contour.ps stars.ps > total.ps
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The output file can be included in other documents but often causes problem 
when being printed.

Note, the order in which you supply the input files is important because
later files are pasted ``on top of'' earlier files, and so can potentially
obscure them. In general, you need to list the input files in the order
in which they were created. 

PSMERGE has other facilities which allow you to scale,
shift and rotate individual input files before including them in the 
output. See \xref{SUN/164}{sun164}{} for details.

\subsubsection{Running the Applications}

The main difference between producing X-window output and PostScript
output is that there is no cursor available when using PostScript. This
means, for instance, that you cannot use \htmlref{PICDEF}{PICDEF} in
cursor mode, and you cannot use \htmlref{CURSOR}{CURSOR} at all! We made
use of both these facilities when we produced 
Figure~ \latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi8}}{8}. 
Pictures must be defined using PICDEF in {\tt XY} mode, or one
of the other positional mode ({\tt CC}, {\tt BL}, {\it etc}). Annotation
such as produced by CURSOR can be created using
\htmlref{LISTMAKE}{LISTMAKE} and \htmlref{LISTSHOW}{LISTSHOW}. You specify
the reference positions for the annotation in any suitable co-ordinate
Frame using LISTMAKE. This creates a \emph{positions list} file
containing these positions, together with associated WCS information.
You then supply this file to LISTSHOW which marks the positions on the 
graphics device in any of the ways provided by CURSOR.

\subsubsection{Using X-windows to Produce a Prototype}

It can often be advantageous to design your final plot using an X-windows
graphics device. This provides more versatility in the form of a graphics
cursor and dynamic lookup table, and also allows you to see the plot more
easily. Once the plot looks right in the X-window, you can then run the
drawing commands again specifying a suitable PostScript device instead.

If you choose to do this, it can be a big help to ensure that the X-window
you are using has the same shape as your selected PostScript device. This 
prevents you accidentally drawing things within regions of the X-window
which are not available in PostScript. To find the require aspect ratio,
do:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % gdclear device=epsf_l
   % gdstate device=epsf_l
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This clears the PostScript device, and then displays the bounds of the 
BASE picture (all the other pictures were erased by GDCLEAR). The results
will look something like this:

\small
\begin{verbatim}

Status of the epsf_l graphics device...

   The current picture is a BASE picture.
   Comment: Base picture
   Current co-ordinate Frame: BASEPIC

   Picture bounds in the BASEPIC Frame:
      Axis 1 (X) : 0.000 to 1.455
      Axis 2 (Y) : 0.000 to 1.000

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This tells you that the aspect ratio (the ratio of the width to the height)
of the PostScript device is 1.455. You should now make an X-window with
this aspect ratio:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % xdestroy xwindows
   % xmake xwindows -height 500 -width 730    
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The {\tt xdestroy} command deletes any existing X-window, and the {\tt
xmake} command creates a new one with a height of 500 pixels and a 
width of 730 pixels, giving the required aspect ratio. Of course, you
could produce a larger or smaller X-window so long as the ratio of width to
height is close to 1.455.

Another tip to ease prototyping on an X-window --- when you run CURSOR,
always store the selected positions in an output positions list, using
parameter OUTCAT. When you come to produce the PostScript files, you can
then supply these positions lists as inputs to LISTSHOW, in order to mimic
the annotation produced by CURSOR when you were prototyping.


\subsubsection{An Example}

As an illustrated example, this section describes how to produce a
PostScript file containing a plot similar to that in Figure~
\latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi8}}{8}. For clarity (at the time), the earlier
sections of this chapter did not adhere to either of the tips given above
when prototyping in an X-window; that is, we did not choose the shape of
the X-window to match our PostScript device, and we did not save the
output from each run of CURSOR in a positions list file. For this reason,
the steps taken here are a little more complicated than they need to be,
and do not mimic exactly the steps taken while prototyping.

First, select and clear the graphics device. We choose a monochrome,
portrait, encapsulated PostScript device:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % gdset epsf_p
   % gdclear
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We will sometimes need to specify positions within the BASE picture.
To do this we can either use the GRAPHICS, the BASEPIC or the NDC Frame,
all of which span the entire graphics device. GRAPHICS is an absolute
co-ordinate system giving millimetres from the bottom left corner of the
graphics device, and BASEPIC is a normalised co-ordinate system in which
both axes have the same scale and the shorter dimension of the graphics
device has length 1.0\footnote{NDC is like BASEPIC but the top right
corner of the device has NDC co-ordinates (1,1).}. The BASEPIC Frame is 
usually easier to work with
since it does not depend on the size of the paper. To determine the
bounds of the available plotting space in the BASEPIC Frame, use
\htmlref{GDSTATE}{GDSTATE}, having first ensured that the BASE picture is
the current picture (this will be the case at the moment since we have just 
cleared the database using GDCLEAR):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % gdstate

   Status of the epsf_p graphics device...
   
      The current picture is a BASE picture.
      Comment: Base picture
      Current co-ordinate Frame: BASEPIC
   
      Picture bounds in the BASEPIC Frame:
         Axis 1 (X) : 0.000 to 1.000
         Axis 2 (Y) : 0.000 to 1.455

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The choice of a portrait PostScript device may have surprised you, given
that Figure~ \latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi8}}{8} seems more naturally to fit
into a landscape page. Portrait mode was chosen so that the final plot
appears up-right when included in a document. If landscape mode had been
chosen, the final plot would have been rotated by 90\dgs\ when included
in a latex document such as this one, requiring the page to be viewed on
its side. However, if we use the entire portrait page, we will have too
much vertical space between the components of the plot. To avoid this we
only use the bottom third (roughly) of the page --- that is, we pretend
that the top of our ``page'' is at 0.6 instead of 1.454659.

We first create a FRAME picture at the left hand side of the page covering
the full height of our reduced ``page'' and 0.6 of the width. We specify
the upper and lower bounds of the picture within the BASEPIC Frame, using
the limits found above, giving the FRAME picture the label ``main'' so
that we can easily re-select the picture later. We then display the
optical image within it, including annotated axes:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % picdef mode=xy lbound=\[0.0,0.0\] ubound=\[0.6,0.6\] outline=no
   % piclabel main
   % display m31 axes mode=perc percentiles=\[30,99\] style="'colour=black,size=0.6'" \
             margin=\[0.2,0.02\] 
   % mv pgplot.ps display1.ps
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Note, we are using a monochrome PostScript device, and so the colour of
all annotation produced by DISPLAY was set to black using the STYLE
parameter. This is done for all applications which produce graphical
output. We also request text which 0.6 of the default size. We specified
the MARGIN parameter when running DISPLAY in order to reduce the margin
on the right hand side of the image. By default, DISPLAY leaves a
margin equal to 0.2 of the width of the DATA picture. We reduced this to
0.02 to make more room for the other components of the plot (the first
value supplied for MARGIN is the bottom margin and is left at 0.2). Note
the {\tt mv} command at the end of the above sequence. This renames the
output postscript file created by DISPLAY so that it is not over-written
by subsequent graphics commands. Throughout the rest of this example, we
will save each required postscript file in this way.

We now draw a box over this image to mark the ``selected region''
indicated in Figure~ \latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi3}}{3}. In this
particular case, we use LISTMAKE to create a positions list holding the
RA and DEC at the two opposite corners of the box. Alternatively, we
could have saved the output from CURSOR while prototyping, using the
OUTCAT parameter. In either case, we use LISTSHOW to draw the box:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % listmake ndf=m31 outcat=boxpos
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 0:41:33.5 40:33:01
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 0:39:25.0 40:54:17
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 
   % listshow boxpos plot=box style='colour=black'
   % mv pgplot.ps box.ps
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Specifying {\tt ndf=m31} resulted in LISTMAKE interpreting the supplied
positions as positions within the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF
{\tt m31}. It also results in all the WCS information being copied from the
NDF into the output positions list.

We now create a Frame in the top right corner of the reduced ``page'' in
which a magnified image of the selected region will be displayed. The
picture occupies the remainder of the width left over by the main image
(0.4 of the total width) and half the height.:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % picdef mode=xy lbound=\[0.6,0.3\] ubound=\[1.0,0.6\] outline=no
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We now display the selected image section within the FRAME picture just
created, and overlay contours from {\tt iras.sdf}. We draw the border
with twice the default width:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % display 'm31(173:213,79:114)' border noaxes mode=scale low=3889 high=10854.78 \
              borstyle='width=2'
   % mv pgplot.ps display2.ps
   % picdata
   % piclabel mag
   % contour noclear noaxes nokey iras mode=perc percentiles=\[55,75,95\]
   % mv pgplot.ps contour.ps
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

What are those two extra commands in the middle? Well, we will need to be
able to re-select the DATA picture holding the image when we come to draw
the warp-lines. To do this we need to label the picture now. For this
reason, we use \htmlref{PICDATA}{PICDATA} to select the DATA picture
created by DISPLAY as the current picture, and then use PICLABEL to give
the label ``mag'' to the picture.

We now display a title above this DATA picture. The string is centred
horizontally within the enclosing FRAME picture ({\it{i.e.}} half way
between 0.6 and 1.0), and drawn so that its bottom edge is placed at the
top of the Frame:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % listmake frame=basepic outcat=ttlpos 
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 0.8 0.6
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 
   % listshow ttlpos plot=text strings='"IRAS 12 \gmm contours"' just=bc
   % mv pgplot.ps title.ps
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

LISTMAKE is used to store the position in a positions list, and then
LISTSHOW is used to draw the title. Again, we could have saved the output
from CURSOR in a positions list while prototyping, instead of using
LISTMAKE to create the positions list. The JUST parameter is set to {\tt
bc} so that the title string is displayed with its bottom centre at the
supplied position.

We now draw the line marking the path of the profiles which will be
displayed later. We draw them in white so that they show up against 
the predominantly dark background of the image:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % listmake ndf=m31 outcat=prfpos 
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 0:41:22.7 40:35:12
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 0:39:56.5 40:50:27
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 
   % listshow prfpos plot=chain marker=3 style="'colour=white,width=3'"
   % mv pgplot.ps line.ps
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The line is drawn with three times the default width. We now create the 
profiles as before:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % profile m31 incat=prfpos out=m31_prof
   % profile iras incat=prfpos out=iras_prof
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
	
We now create a FRAME picture occupying the remaining area at the bottom 
right corner of the page, and display the two profiles in it. We use
line style to differentiate the two curves, instead of colour as we
did when prototyping:
 
\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % picdef mode=xy lbound=\[0.6,0.0\] ubound=\[1.0,0.3\] outline=no
   % linplot m31_prof style=^style1 keystyle='size=0.7'
   % mv pgplot.ps m31_prof.ps 
   % linplot iras_prof noclear noalign style=^style2
   % mv pgplot.ps iras_prof.ps 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The appearances of the two plots are controlled by the two plotting
styles contained in the text files {\tt style1} and {\tt style2}.
{\tt style1} contains the following attribute settings:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   tickall=0
   colour=black
   gap(2)=1000
   drawtitle=0
   label(2)=DSS data value (solid)
   textlabgap(1)=0.02
   labelunits=0
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The file {\tt style2} contains the following attribute settings:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   edge(2)=r
   gap(2)=0.2
   tickall=0
   colour=black
   style(curve)=2
   drawtitle=0
   label(2)=IRAS data value (dashed)
   textlabgap(1)=0.02
   labelunits=0
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Now comes the complicated bit --- the warp lines! The problem is that we
used the cursor to define the start and end of these lines when
prototyping. This was good enough for an X-window which has relatively
low resolution, but will not do for PostScript. We cannot place the
cursor accurately enough to ensure that there is no visible gap between
the end of the line and the corresponding box corner when using
PostScript, so we cannot use the positions found while prototyping. The
only way to ensure that the lines join up properly with the box corners
is to use the co-ordinates of the box corners to define the lines. First,
we need to transform the box corners into the BASEPIC Frame since both
ends of each line must be given within the same co-ordinate Frame. 

We start with the ``selection box'' drawn over the main image. The
corners of this box are currently stored in the {\tt boxpos} positions
list. This file contains the RA and DEC at the corners of the box,
together with WCS information copied from the NDF {\tt m31}. But this
does \emph{not} include the BASEPIC, NDC or CURPIC Frame, which are only 
available within
the WCS information stored with graphics database pictures. In order to
find the BASEPIC co-ordinates at the corners of the box, we need to 
align the RA/DEC values in the positions list with the WCS information
stored with the first DATA picture we created (the main image), and then
display the corresponding BASEPIC co-ordinates. LISTSHOW can do this, but
we need to change the current picture first. At the moment,
the current picture is the FRAME containing the line plots. If we did not
change the current picture LISTSHOW would assume that the supplied RA/DEC 
values refer to the line plots (not to the main image), and would
consequently give the wrong BASEPIC co-ordinates. We use PICSEL to
select the FRAME picture containing the main image (so that it becomes
the current picture), and then run LISTSHOW:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % picsel main   
   % listshow boxpos plot=blank frame=BASEPIC

     Title: M31 (Digitised Sky Survey)
   
      Position        X           Y
     identifier
     -----------------------------------
   
       #1         0.3657834   0.1911708
       #2         0.4269177   0.245274

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The parameter assignment PLOT=BLANK tells LISTSHOW to search the graphics
database for a picture with which the positions in {\tt boxpos} can be
aligned, but without marking the positions in any way on the screen.
Doing this means that the co-ordinate Frames stored with the picture are
available when specifying a value for parameter FRAME. This is necessary
because the BASEPIC Frame is only available within graphics data base
pictures since it describes positions on a graphics device.

We now find the BASEPIC co-ordinates at the corners of the magnified image.
The most simple way of doing this is to use the same RA/DEC positions. The
problem with this approach is that the bounds of the magnified image were
rounded to a whole number of pixels and so may not correspond exactly to
the RA an DEC at the corners of the selection box. A more accurate method
is to use the pixel indices at the corners of the image section to
define the box corners. We first need to create a positions list holding
the pixel co-ordinate bounds of the image section, remembering to reduce
the lower pixel index bounds by 1.0 in order to convert the integer 
\emph{pixel indices} into floating point \emph{pixel co-ordinates}
(see \hyperref{here}{section }{}{se:pixgrd} for more information about
pixel co-ordinates and indices): 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % listmake frame=pixel dim=2 outcat=magpos
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 172.0 78.0
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 213.0 114.0
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We now need to use LISTSHOW to get the corresponding BASEPIC co-ordinates,
aligning the above PIXEL co-ordinates with the DATA picture holding the
magnified image section. Another slight complication arises here since the
required DATA picture is obscured by the DATA picture holding the IRAS 
contours. Pixel co-ordinates in the IRAS image are totally different to 
those in the grey-scale image, and so we need to make sure that LISTSHOW
is using the correct DATA picture. However, we labelled the required DATA
picture when it was created and so we can just use PICSEL to re-select it:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % picsel mag
   % listshow magpos plot=blank frame=BASEPIC
     Alignment has occurred within the PIXEL Domain.
   
   
     Title: Output from LISTMAKE
   
      Position        X           Y
     identifier
     -----------------------------------
   
       #1         0.6473798   0.3159827
       #2         0.9524395   0.5838399

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We now create a positions list containing the BASEPIC co-ordinates at 
the ends of the upper warp line, and draw it. By default, LISTSHOW draws
within the most recent DATA picture contained within the current picture.
Since the line is not contained within a single DATA picture, we need to
tell LISTSHOW to draw within the BASE picture. This is done by setting
parameter NAME to BASE (we also revert to drawing in black):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % listmake frame=basepic outcat=war1pos
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 0.3657834 0.245274
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 0.6473798 0.5838399
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 
   % listshow war1pos plot=poly style='colour=black' name=base
   % mv pgplot.ps war1.ps 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The last drawing we need to do is to create the second warp line in the
same way:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % listmake frame=basepic outcat=war2pos
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 0.4269177 0.1911708
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 0.9524395 0.3159827
     POSITION - A position for the output list /!/ > 
   % listshow war2pos plot=poly name=base
   % mv pgplot.ps war2.ps 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We now have separate PostScript files containing the output from all the
above applications. These are stacked together in the order they were
created to produce the final encapsulated PostScript file:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % psmerge -e display1.ps box.ps display2.ps contour.ps title.ps \
                line.ps m31_prof.ps iras_prof.ps war1.ps war2.ps > total.eps
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The file {\tt total.eps} is displayed in Figure~ \latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:agi9}}{9}.

\section{\xlabel{se_wcsuse}Using World Co-ordinate Systems\label{se:wcsuse}}

\subsection{\xlabel{se_pixgrd}Pixel Indices, Pixel Co-ordinates, and Grid
Co-ordinates\label{se:pixgrd}}
In this sub-section we will look at the definition of the three basic
co-ordinate systems available in all NDFs --- pixel indices, pixel
co-ordinates, and grid co-ordinates.

\emph{Pixel indices} are integer values which are used to count the
pixels along each axis of an NDF. The first pixel can be given any
arbitrary pixel index, and this value is known as the \emph{pixel origin}.
When a section is extracted from an NDF, the pixel origin in the
extracted section is set so that each pixel retains its original pixel
indices (see Figure~\latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:pixind}}{1}). 

\begin{latexonly}
   \begin{figure}[hbt]
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[clip,height=100mm]{sun95_pixind.eps}
   \caption{Pixel indices.}

\end{latexonly}

\begin{htmlonly}
   \label{fi:pixind}
   \htmladdimg{sun95_pixind.gif}

   Figure 1: Pixel indices

\end{htmlonly}


\emph{Pixel co-ordinates} are floating point values which allow positions
to be specified with sub-pixel accuracy. They are related to pixel indices
as indicated in Figure~\latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:pixco}}{2}). 

\begin{latexonly}
   \begin{figure}[hbt]
   \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[clip,height=54mm]{sun95_pixco.eps}

   \htmladdimg{sun95_pixco.gif}

   Figure 1: Pixel co-ordinates.

\end{htmlonly}


\emph{Grid co-ordinates} are floating point values which are similar to
pixel co-ordinates except that the origin is fixed so that the first
pixel on an axis is centred at a grid co-ordinate value of $1.0$, no matter
what the pixel origin is. This corresponds to the FITS idea of ``pixel 
co-ordinates'' (FITS makes no provision for an arbitrary pixel
origin). When a section is extracted from an array, the grid co-ordinates
of the extracted section include no knowledge of where the section
was located in the original array. See
Figure~\latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:gridco}}{3}).

\subsection{\xlabel{se_domains}Co-ordinate Frames, Axes and Domains\label{se:domains}}

A \emph{co-ordinate Frame} is a system of co-ordinate axes which can be
used to specify a position within an NDF data array. Within an NDF such
co-ordinate Frames also have associated descriptive information such as
axis labels, axis units, a Frame title, {\it etc.}\ These are called the
\emph{attributes} of the Frame, and the most commonly used are listed 
briefly below (full descriptions of these attributes are included later in 
this section):

\begin{verse}
{\tt Digits}: Number of digits of precision\\
{\tt Domain}: Co-ordinate system domain\\
{\tt Format(axis)}: Format specification for axis values\\
{\tt Label(axis)}: Axis label\\
{\tt Naxes}: Number of Frame axes\\
{\tt Symbol(axis)}: Axis symbol\\
{\tt Title}: Frame title\\
{\tt Unit(axis)}: Axis physical units
\end{verse}

The single most important attribute is the Frame {\tt Domain}, which is an
upper-case character string indicating the physical domain in which the
co-ordinate system is defined. Frames with the same {\tt Domain} can, in
general, be aligned with each other.

Frames with the following {\tt Domain} values are defined within every
NDF, no matter how the NDF is created:

\begin{description}

\item[GRID]\begin{latexonly}\mbox{}\\ \end{latexonly} Corresponds to grid
co-ordinates.

\item[PIXEL]\begin{latexonly}\mbox{}\\ \end{latexonly} Corresponds to
pixel co-ordinates. 

\item[AXIS]\begin{latexonly}\mbox{}\\ \end{latexonly} Corresponds to
the co-ordinate system defined by the AXIS structures within the NDF.

An AXIS structure is a 1-dimensional array which maps pixel index along a
given axis onto another related co-ordinate axis ({\it e.g.}\ wavelength)
-- the values on the other axes are assumed to be constant. Each
dimension in the NDF should have an associated AXIS structure. Such
structures can be created (for instance) using \htmlref{SETAXIS}{SETAXIS}.
If the NDF does \emph{not} have defined AXIS structures, then a default AXIS 
Frame will be used in which the values along each axis correspond to
pixel co-ordinates.

AXIS structures can only be used to represent independent axes. For
instance, celestial co-ordinates cannot (in general) be described using
AXIS structures because celestial longitude and latitude may both vary
along any given row or column of an NDF.\footnote{For this and other
reasons, new applications will avoid using AXIS structures, and make use
of the more versatile WCS component instead.} If an application is used
which renders the AXIS structures in an NDF invalid, then the AXIS
structures will not be copied to the output NDF. For instance, if
\htmlref{ROTATE}{ROTATE} is used to rotate an NDF by an angle which is
not a multiple of 90\dgs, then the output NDF will not have any AXIS
structures, and so the AXIS Frame will default to pixel co-ordinates.

\end{description}

The dimensionality of each of these Frames is equal to that of the NDF
({\it e.g.}\ a 2-dimensional NDF will have 2-dimensional PIXEL, GRID and AXIS
Frames). Axes within a Frame are identified by an integer index in the
range 1 to the number of axes in the Frame. The above Frames are not
stored permanently in the NDF, but are generated automatically by the NDF
access library each time a reference is made to them.

In addition to the PIXEL, AXIS and GRID Frames, an NDF may also contain any
number of additional co-ordinates Frames. Descriptions of these extra
Frames, together with recipes for converting positions between
them, are stored permanently in the NDFs WCS component which may be
examined using the \htmlref{NDFTRACE}{NDFTRACE} command. Application
\htmlref{WCSADD}{WCSADD} allows new Frames to be added to the WCS
component (positions in the new Frame must be related to the 
corresponding positions in an existing Frame by one of several different
supported types of Mapping).
\htmlref{WCSREMOVE}{WCSREMOVE} allows Frames to be removed from the WCS
component.

One common additional Frame {\tt Domain} is SKY. This is reserved to refer to
2-dimensional Frames which describe celestial longitude and latitude. Such 
Frames are known as ``SkyFrames'' and have additional attributes indicating
the particular celestial co-ordinate system in use ({\it e.g.}\ equatorial,
galactic, ecliptic, {\it etc}), and any required qualifying parameters (epoch,
equinox, {\it etc}). A SkyFrame can be added to an NDF by importing it
from suitable FITS headers using \htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN}, 
\htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN} or the CONVERT package (see \xref{SUN/55}{sun55}{}).
Alternatively, a SkyFrame can be created directly by specifying the pixel
co-ordinates of stars with known celestial co-ordinates (see
\htmlref{SETSKY}{SETSKY} and \GAIAref\ ).

\subsection{\xlabel{se_curframe}FrameSets, and the Current Frame\label{se:curframe}}
Any co-ordinate Frames described in the WCS component, together with the
standard GRID, PIXEL and AXIS Frames, form a collection of inter-related
Frames called a \emph{FrameSet}. A FrameSet contains descriptions of each
Frame, plus recipes (called \emph{Mappings}) describing how to convert
positions from one Frame to another.\footnote{A Mapping need not
necessarily be defined in both directions. For instance, a Mapping which
goes from a 3-dimensional Frame to a 2-dimensional Frame (maybe by simply
throwing away one of the axis values) may not be defined in the other
direction. {\footnotesize KAPPA} applications will report an error if a Mapping is not
defined in the required direction. Another common example of a
uni-directional Mapping is that between the GRID and AXIS Frames in 
cases where the AXIS structures are non-monotonic.}

Frames within a FrameSet are distinguished by their attribute values,
primarily their {\tt Domain} value. In addition, each Frame has an integer
\emph{Frame index}. These indices are (in general) allocated sequentially
in chronological order as Frames are added into the FrameSet.
Applications which require the user to specify a Frame will usually allow
the Frame to be specified either by {\tt Domain} name, or by index. Frame indices
can be examined using \htmlref{NDFTRACE}{NDFTRACE} (see below).

One Frame within the FrameSet of an NDF is nominated as the \emph{current
co-ordinate Frame}. When-ever an application reports positions within
an NDF (for instance, when annotating plot axes), the positions reported 
will refer to the current co-ordinate Frame. Likewise, when-ever an 
application requests a position from the user (for instance, the position
to be placed at the centred of a displayed image), it will expect the
position to be given within the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF,

The contents of the WCS component of an an NDF can be examined using
\htmlref{NDFTRACE}{NDFTRACE}. By default, this just shows the number of
co-ordinates Frames defined within the NDF (including the three standard
ones), and the {\tt Title} and {\tt Domain} of the current co-ordinate Frame. More
detail can be obtained using the keywords FULLWCS and FULLFRAME. The
first causes the {\tt Title}, index and {\tt Domain} of all Frames to be displayed,
together with the index of the current Frame. The second causes a more
complete description of each Frame to be displayed, including axis
labels, units, celestial co-ordinate system (for SkyFrames), {\it etc.}

The current co-ordinate Frame can also be examined using
\htmlref{WCSFRAME}{WCSFRAME}. This is an important application because
it also allows you to change the current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF.
For instance:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % wcsframe m31 pixel
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

will make the PIXEL Frame the current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF
\verb+m31+. After this, all references to positions within the NDF
\verb+m31+ will refer to pixel co-ordinates.

\subsection{Reserved Domain Names}
New co-ordinates Frames can be created and added into an NDF using 
\htmlref{WCSADD}{WCSADD}. When you create a new Frame you should give it
a meaningful {\tt Domain} name which indicates the sort of co-ordinates which it
represents. You are free to choose any name you like (white space is removed, 
and lower case characters are converted to upper case before using the
supplied {\tt Domain} string), but you should usually avoid the following reserved 
{\tt Domain} names:

\begin{description}
\item [GRID] --- Reserved to represent grid co-ordinates (in units of
pixels).
\item [PIXEL] --- Reserved to represent pixel co-ordinates (in units of
pixels).
\item [AXIS] --- Reserved to represent AXIS co-ordinates (in arbitrary units).
\item [SKY] --- Reserved to represent celestial longitude and latitude (in
any suitable system, but always stored internally in units of radians).
\item [GRAPHICS] --- Reserved to represent positions on a graphics device 
in units of millimetres. measured from the bottom left corner 
of the device.
\item [BASEPIC] --- Reserved to represent positions on a graphics device 
in normalised units, in which the shorter axis of the graphics device has
length 1.0.
\item [NDC] --- Reserved to represent positions on a graphics device 
in normalised units, in which the both axes of the graphics device have
length 1.0.
\item [CURPIC] --- Reserved to represent positions in normalised units within 
each individual graphics database picture. The shorter axis of each 
picture has length 1.0 in this Frame.
\end{description}

\subsection{\xlabel{se_scs}Specifying a Co-ordinate Frame\label{se:scs}}
Several applications (\htmlref{WCSFRAME}{WCSFRAME},
\htmlref{CURSOR}{CURSOR}, \htmlref{LISTMAKE}{LISTMAKE}, {\it etc}) have
parameters which are used to select a co-ordinate Frame.
These parameters are usually called FRAME. When selecting a Frame from an
existing FrameSet ({\it e.g.}\ read from the WCS component of an NDF),
the Frame may be specified in one of the following ways:

\begin{itemize}

\item As an integer Frame index within the specified FrameSet starting at
1 for the first Frame.

\item As a {\tt Domain} name ({\it e.g.}\ PIXEL, AXIS, SKY, {\it etc}),
selected from those available in the FrameSet.

\item As a ``Sky Co-ordinate System'' (SCS) specification. This notation
has been inherited from the IRAS90 package (see \xref{SUN/163}{sun163{}}),
and can be used to indicate a specific celestial co-ordinate system.
Simply specifying the {\tt Domain} name SKY will select any SkyFrame which is
present, irrespective of the particular celestial co-ordinate system which
the SkyFrame represents. If you want to request a particular celestial
co-ordinate system ({\it e.g.}\ galactic, equatorial, ecliptic, {\it etc}), then use an
SCS specification. If the requested system is not present, but a related
SkyFrame can be found for a different system, then the SkyFrame will be
modified so that it represents the requested system (the Mappings between
the SkyFrame and the other Frames in the FrameSet will also be modified 
appropriately).

An SCS specification is made up of two parts; a co-ordinate system name,
followed by an optional epoch giving the reference equinox. Any of the
three system names {\small EQUATORIAL, ECLIPTIC} and {\small GALACTIC}
can be used. Case is insignificant, and abbreviations may be given.

Ecliptic and equatorial co-ordinates are referred to the mean equinox of a
given epoch. This epoch is specified by appending it to the end of the
name of the sky co-ordinate system, in parentheses; for instance {\small
EQUATORIAL(1983.5)} (only the four most significant decimal places are
used). The epoch may be preceded by a single character, B or J,
indicating if the epoch is a Besselian epoch (B) or a Julian epoch (J).
If this character is missing (as in the above example), then the epoch is
assumed to be Besselian if it less than 1984.0, and Julian otherwise. If no 
equinox is specified in this way, then a default of B1950.0 is used.

If a Julian epoch is used to specify the reference equinox for
an equatorial co-ordinate system, then the equatorial co-ordinates
are assumed to be in the IAU 1976, FK5, Fricke system. If the
equinox is specified using a Besselian epoch, then the
co-ordinates are assumed to be in the FK4, Bessel-Newcomb system.

When a Frame is specified using an SCS specification, it will usually
also be necessary to specify the epoch at which the positions were
determined. This will be done using the separate parameter EPOCH. This
epoch is required because some celestial co-ordinate systems are
non-inertial and rotate slowly with respect to other celestial
co-ordinate systems, introducing fictitious proper motions. Knowing the
date at which the positions were determined allows the effect of this
fictitious proper motion to be eliminated when converting between
different systems.

\end{itemize}

When specifying a new Frame (rather than selecting an existing Frame
from a FrameSet), you can either give a {\tt Domain} name, or an SCS
specification, but you cannot give a Frame index. Any string may be used
as a {\tt Domain} name, and you will usually be required to specify
the number of axes in the Frame. The exception to this is if you specify
one of the {\tt Domain} names SKY, GRAPHICS, NDC, CURPIC or BASEPIC, in which 
case a two dimensional Frame is always created.


\subsection{Propagation of WCS Information}
{\footnotesize KAPPA} applications which create an output NDF on the basis of a given
input NDF usually copy the contents of the WCS component from the input
to the output, modifying it as appropriate to take account of any linear 
mapping of pixel co-ordinates introducing by the application. The following 
are exceptions to this rule:

\begin{itemize}

\item Applications in which positions in the output NDF are
not linearly related to corresponding positions in the input NDF 
({\it e.g.}\ \htmlref{ELPROF}{ELPROF},
\htmlref{CHAIN}{CHAIN}, \htmlref{RESHAPE}{RESHAPE}).

\item Applications in which the output NDF is not a direct representation
of the input NDF ({\it e.g.}\ \htmlref{FOURIER}{FOURIER}).

\end{itemize}

The output NDFs produced by such applications will contain no WCS component
(but they will still have the three standard Frames --- GRID, PIXEL and
AXIS --- albeit the AXIS Frame will probably just describe pixel
co-ordinates since these applications will not usually copy the
AXIS structures either).

The application \htmlref{WCSCOPY}{WCSCOPY} can be used to copy the WCS
component from one NDF to another, optionally introducing a linear
transformation of pixel co-ordinates in the process. This can be used to
add WCS information back into an NDF which has been stripped of WCS
information by one of the above applications. 

\subsection{Reading WCS Information Stored in Other Forms}

When a {\footnotesize KAPPA} application requires WCS information, it looks
first in the WCS component of the NDF. If no WCS component is defined
within the NDF, then it will attempt to obtain WCS information from two
other locations, in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}

\item If an IRAS90 astrometry structure (see \xref{SUN/163}{sun163}{}) is 
present within the NDF, then WCS information will be read from it, and
added to the FrameSet holding the GRID, PIXEL and AXIS Frames. IRAS90 
astrometry structures have been used by several applications packages in
the past for storing astrometry information. {\footnotesize KAPPA} contains 
the \htmlref{SETSKY}{SETSKY} application which can be used to create such
a structure, either by supplying the required numerical parameters (pixel
size, image orientation, {\it etc}), or by doing a least squares fit to a set of
pixel co-ordinates with corresponding celestial co-ordinates. 

\item If no IRAS90 astrometry structure can be found, an attempt is made
to read WCS information from the FITS header cards in the FITS extension.

\end{enumerate}

Note, {\footnotesize KAPPA} applications always \emph{write} WCS
information in the form of a standard WCS component. You should remember
that astrometry information stored within an IRAS90 or FITS extension will
not be corrected to take account of geometric manipulation produced by 
applications such as \htmlref{ROTATE}{ROTATE}, \htmlref{COMPAVE}{COMPAVE},
{\it etc.}\ Use of such applications will render IRAS90 and FITS astrometry
information incorrect. For this reason, applications always warn the user
if astrometry information is being read from an IRAS90 or FITS extension.
These extension can be deleted if necessary, using the \htmlref{ERASE}{ERASE}
command. For instance:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % erase m31.more.iras90
   % erase m31.more.fits
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

will erase the IRAS90 and FITS extensions from the NDF \verb+m31+.

\subsection{Using SETSKY to Add a Celestial Co-ordinate Frame to an NDF}
As mentioned in the previous section, the \htmlref{SETSKY}{SETSKY}
application stores astrometry information within an NDF in the form of
either a WCS component or an IRAS90 astrometry structure. 

To use SETSKY, you need to know the celestial co-ordinates at a set of
points within the image. You may be able to find these by comparing
your image with other images, such as those available from the 
Digitised Sky Survey, which already have astrometry information
associated with them. You create a text file holding the pixel and
celestial co-ordinates at a single position on each line. For instance, 
if you have five known RA/DEC (B1950) positions in your image, the file 
may look like:

\small
\begin{verbatim}

 0 49 05.9,   42 25 30,    32,    266
 0 48 31.7,   40 03 36,    39,    29
 0 37 03.0,   40 04 48,    258,   31
 0 36 54.6,   42 26 47,    257,   268
 0 45 47.7,   41 54 03,    93,    213

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The first column gives the RA values (hours, minutes and seconds), the 
second gives the DEC values (degrees, arc-minutes and arc-seconds), the 
third gives the pixel X co-ordinates, and the fourth gives the pixel Y
co-ordinates.

If this file is called \verb+pos.dat+, then the following command can be
used to create a WCS component:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
   % setsky m31 ^pos.dat coords='equ(b1950)' epoch=1998.0 projtype=gno

     Trying GNOMONIC projection...

     These parameter values give an RMS positional error of 0.3647723 pixels ...
       Projection type                      : GNOMONIC
       Sky co-ordinates of reference point  : 0h 40m 31.29s, 42d 37m 53.15s
       Image co-ordinates of reference point: (190.3287,285.795)
       Pixel dimensions                     : (36.04451,36.00686) arcsecs
       Position angle of image Y axis       : 359d 38m 35.77s
       Tilt of celestial sphere             : 0d 0m 0.00s

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Note the up-arrow character (``\verb+^+'') before the file name
(\verb+pos.dat+). This tells SETSKY that the string is a file name. A
gnomonic (or \emph{tangent plane}) projection was requested using the
PROJTYPE parameter. If no projection type is specified then SETSKY will
try four different projections (gnomonic, Aitoff, Lambert equivalent
cylindrical, and orthographic) in turn, and choose the one which gives
the smallest RMS position error.

An alternative way to add a celestial co-ordinate Frame to an NDF is to
use the facilities of GAIA (see \xref{SUN/214}{sun214}{}). This provides
much more sophisticated facilities.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_frmatt}Frame Attributes\label{se:frmatt}}

Each co-ordinate Frame has several \emph{attributes} 
which determine its
properties. This section lists the most important of these. See
\xref{SUN/210}{sun210}{} for a complete description of the properties of
Frames and their attributes. The application \htmlref{WCSATTRIB}{WCSATTRIB} 
can be used to examine attribute values associated with the current Frame
of an NDF, and change the values of those which are not read-only.

\sstroutine{
   Digits/Digits(axis)
}{
   Number of digits of precision
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This attribute specifies how many digits of precision are
      required by default when a co-ordinate value is formatted for a
      Frame axis ({\it e.g.}\ when producing annotated
      plot axes). Its value may be set either
      for a Frame as a whole, or (by subscripting the attribute name
      with the number of an axis) for each axis individually. Any
      value set for an individual axis will over-ride the value for
      the Frame as a whole.

      Note that the {\tt Digits} value acts only as a means of determining a
      default value for the {\tt Format} attribute. Its 
      effects are over-ridden if a {\tt Format} string is set explicitly for an 
      axis.

      The default {\tt Digits} value for a Frame is 7. If a value less than 1 is 
      supplied, then 1 is used instead.

      If the Frame is actually a SkyFrame ({\it
      e.g.}\ describes celestial longitude and latitude), then the {\tt
      Digits} value specifies the total number of digits in the formatted
      axis value -- that is, the sum of the hours (or degrees), minutes
      and seconds digits.

      The {\tt Epoch} value is important in cases where the co-ordinates of
      sources may change with time. Possible reasons for this include:
      (i) changing aberration of light caused by the observer's
      velocity ({\it e.g.}\ due to the Earth's motion around the Sun), (ii)
      changing gravitational deflection by the Sun due to changes in

   \sstdescription{
      This attribute is used to qualify those celestial co-ordinate
      systems described by a SkyFrame which are 
      notionally based on
      the ecliptic (the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun)
      and/or the Earth's equator.

      Both of these planes are in motion and their positions are
      difficult to specify precisely. In practice, therefore, a model
      ecliptic and/or equator are used instead. These, together with
      the point on the sky that defines the co-ordinate origin (the
      intersection of the two planes termed the ``mean equinox'') move
      with time according to some model which removes the more rapid
      fluctuations. The SkyFrame class supports both the old FK4 and
      the current FK5 models.

      The position of a fixed source expressed in any of these
      co-ordinate systems will appear to change with time due to
      movement of the co-ordinate system itself (rather than motion of
      the source).  Such co-ordinate systems must therefore be
      qualified by a moment in time (the ``epoch of the mean equinox''
      or ``equinox'' for short) which allows the position of the model
      co-ordinate system on the sky to be determined. This is the role
      of the {\tt Equinox} attribute.

      The {\tt Equinox} attribute is stored as a Modified Julian Date, but
      when setting or getting its value you may use the same formats

      This attribute specifies the format to be used when displaying
      co-ordinate values associated with a particular Frame axis
      ({\it i.e.}\ to convert values from binary to character form). 

      If no {\tt Format} value is set for a Frame axis, a default value is
      supplied instead. This is based on the value of the {\tt Digits}, or
      {\tt Digits(axis)}, attribute and is chosen so that it displays the

      The interpretation of this string depends on whether or not the

      function ({\it e.g.}\ ``{\tt \%1.7G}'') in order to format a single 
      co-ordinate value (supplied as a double precision number).

      The {\tt Format} string supplied for a SkyFrame should contain zero or
      more of the following characters. These may occur in any order,
      but the following is recommended for clarity:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         ``$+$'': Indicates that a plus sign should be prefixed to positive
         values. By default, no plus sign is used.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt z}'': Indicates that leading zeros should be prefixed to the
         value so that the first field is of constant width, as would be
         required in a fixed-width table (leading zeros are always
         prefixed to any fields that follow). By default, no leading
         zeros are added.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt i}'': Use the standard ISO field separator (a colon) between
         fields. This is the default behaviour.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt b}'': Use a blank to separate fields.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt l}'': Use a letter (``{\tt h}''/``{\tt d}'', ``{\tt m}'' or ``{\tt s}'' as appropriate) to
         separate fields.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt d}'': Include a degrees field. Expressing the angle purely in
         degrees is also the default if none of ``{\tt h}'', ``{\tt m}'', ``{\tt s}'' or ``{\tt t}'' are
         given.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt h}'': Express the angle as a time and include an hours field
         (where 24 hours correspond to 360 degrees). Expressing the angle
         purely in hours is also the default if ``{\tt t}'' is given without
         either ``{\tt m}'' or ``{\tt s}''.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt m}'': Include a minutes field. By default this is not included.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt s}'': Include a seconds field. By default this is not included.
         This request is ignored if ``{\tt d}'' or ``{\tt h}'' is given, unless a minutes
         field is also included.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt t}'': Express the angle as a time (where 24 hours correspond to
         360 degrees). This option is ignored if either ``{\tt d}'' or ``{\tt h}'' is
         given and is intended for use where the value is to be expressed
         purely in minutes and/or seconds of time (with no hours
         field). If ``{\tt t}'' is given without ``{\tt d}'', ``{\tt h}'', ``{\tt m}'' or ``{\tt s}'' being
         present, then it is equivalent to ``{\tt h}''.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt .}'': Indicates that decimal places are to be given for the
         final field in the formatted string (whichever field this
         is). The ``{\tt .}'' should be followed immediately by an unsigned
         integer which gives the number of decimal places required. By
         default, no decimal places are given.

      }
      All of the above format specifiers are case-insensitive. If
      several characters make conflicting requests ({\it e.g.}\ if both ``{\tt i}''
      and ``{\tt b}'' appear), then the character occurring last takes
      precedence, except that ``{\tt d}'' and ``{\tt h}'' always override ``{\tt t}''.

         both an {\tt Equinox} and an {\tt Epoch} value.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt FK5}'' or ``{\tt EQUATORIAL}'': The modern FK5 (barycentric) equatorial
         co-ordinate system. This should be qualified by an {\tt Equinox} value.

         \sstitem
         ``{\tt GAPPT}'', ``{\tt GEOCENTRIC}'' or ``{\tt APPARENT}'': The geocentric apparent
         equatorial co-ordinate system, which gives the apparent positions
         of sources relative to the true plane of the Earth's equator and
         the equinox (the co-ordinate origin) at a time specified by the
         qualifying {\tt Epoch} value. (Note that no {\tt Equinox} is needed to
         qualify this co-ordinate system because no model ``mean equinox''

\section{\xlabel{se_interaction}Interaction Mode\label{se:interaction}}

We have seen the different co-ordinate systems {\footnotesize KAPPA} uses.
Now we address how the applications obtain co-ordinate information
itself.  Applications often permit a variety of mechanisms for obtaining those
co-ordinates. Typical possibilities are as follows.
\begin{description}
\item [Catalogue] --- In this mode the application reads a file
containing a positions list. This can either be a FITS binary
table, or a text file in STL format, and can contain WCS Information
allowing positions within the catalogue to be aligned with other data.
Positions lists can be created by several applications such as CURSOR,
LISTMAKE, CENTROID, \emph{etc.}
\item [Cursor] --- This mode utilises the cursor of the current graphics
device.  For this to work the array must already be displayed as an
image, or a contour plot, or line plot (provided the application handles
1-dimensional data), and the picture is stored in the graphics database.
\item [Interface] --- This mode obtains co-ordinates from
the parameter system, usually in response to prompting.
\item [File] --- In this mode the application reads a text file
containing a list of co-ordinates in free format, one object per record.
There may be commentary lines in the file beginning with {\tt \#} or
{\tt !}.  The format and syntax of the files are {\it ad hoc}, and are
described in the application documentation.
\end{description}

Applications that permit these options have a parameter, called
MODE, by which you can control how positional data are to be acquired.
It would be tedious to have to specify a mode for each application,
therefore {\footnotesize KAPPA} has a
\htmlref{global parameter}{se:parglobals}---the interaction
mode---to which each application's interaction-mode parameter is
defaulted.  The global value remains in force until you change it by
assigning an application's interaction mode on the command line. The
following examples shows the effect of the global parameter.  For
compactness \htmlref{GLOBALS}{GLOBALS} will merely show the
interaction mode.

First we display an image on the {\tt xw} windows device.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> gdset xw
     ICL> display $KAPPA_DIR/ccdframec mode=pe \
     Data will be scaled from 2366.001 to 2614.864.
     ICL> globals
     The current interaction mode is      : <undefined>
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Now we obtain the centroids of a couple of stellar/galaxian images via
each of the interaction modes.  First in cursor mode.  Note that
\htmlref{CENTROID}{CENTROID} obtains the name of the input NDF from the
graphics database in this mode.  If you need to preview which NDF is
going to be selected use the \htmlref{PICIN}{PICIN} command.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> centroid mode=c
     Current picture has name: DATA, comment: KAPPA_DISPLAY.
     Using /star/bin/kappa/ccdframec as the input NDF.
     
     To select a point press the left button on the mouse or trackerball.
     To exit press the right button.
     Use the cursor to select one point.
 
     Input guess position was     86.23534, 295.0848
     Output centroid position is  86.41057, 295.1141
 
     Use the cursor to select one point.
 
     Input guess position was     73.32529, 318.9757
     Output centroid position is  72.76437, 318.9484
 
     Use the cursor to select one point.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
If we look at the global parameters again, indeed we see that it has
become cursor mode.  

Now we'll see the effect of changing the mode parameter.  Note that
unless it is undefined or the application does not support the current
mode, you must change the mode on the command line.  First we shall
prompt for the co-ordinates.  A null ends the loop.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> centroid mode=i
     NDF - Array to be analysed /@/star/bin/kappa/ccdframec/ >
     INIT - Guess at co-ordinates of star-like feature /108.8,403.5/ > 86,295

     Input guess position was     86, 295
     Output centroid position is  86.41057, 295.1141
     
     INIT - Guess at co-ordinates of star-like feature /86,295/ > 73.3,319
 
     Input guess position was     73.3, 319
     Output centroid position is  72.76437, 318.9484
 
     INIT - Guess at co-ordinates of star-like feature /73.3,319/ > !
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Finally, we can create a text file called {\tt starlist.dat} and run
CENTROID in file mode.  

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> cat > starlist.dat
     86 295
     73 320
     CTRL/D
     ICL> centroid mode=f
     COIN - File of initial positions /@centroid.lis/ > starlist.dat
     NDF - Array to be analysed /@$KAPPA_DIR/ccdframec/ >
 
     Input guess position was     86, 295
     Output centroid position is  86.41057, 295.1141
 
     Input guess position was     73, 320
     Output centroid position is  72.76437, 318.9484
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Such co-ordinate files can also be created interactively with images by
\htmlref{CURSOR}{CURSOR}.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{se_coltab}Graphics Device Colour Table and Palette
\label{se:coltab}}

The \PGPLOTref\ graphics package which is used by {\footnotesize KAPPA} 
draws images and line graphics using a set of ``pens''. The number of pens 
available is limited to 256, even on 16 or 24 bit graphics devices which
nominally have ``millions'' of colours. On 8 bit graphics devices, the
number of available pens may be less than 256 if any other applications
have ``grabbed'' colours for their own use\footnote{Netscape is notorious 
for this. If you have problems allocating sufficient colours, try killing
any netscape browsers you have running.}. 

Each PGPLOT pen draws in a single colour, but you can choose what that
colour will be for each pen. This allocation of colours to pens is called
the PGPLOT ``colour table''. Each pen has a corresponding integer
\emph{index} within the table. On 8-bit graphics devices you can allocate
any arbitrary combination of red, green and blue to a pen (each colour is
specified as an ``intensity'' in the range zero to one). On 16 and 24 bit
devices you can only allocate one of the ``millions'' of colours known to
the graphics device. For instance, on 16 bit devices it is common to
allocate 5 bits each to the red and blue intensity and the remaining 6
bits to the green intensity. This means that red and blue can only be set
accurate to 1 part in 32 on these devices, which may result in colours
not being exactly as you want them.

On an 8-bit device, any changes which you make to the colour table are
immediately reflected in the visual appearance of the display. For
instance, if you set pen 1 to red, then draw something using pen 1, it
will appear red on the screen. If you then change pen 1 to blue, the
previously drawn graphics will immediately change colour without you
needing to re-draw them. This is \emph{not} usually true for 16 and 24 bit
devices. That is, changing pen colours will usually have no effect on
previously drawn graphics. In order to see the effects of the changed pen
colour, you will need to re-display the graphics.

In many image procesing and visualisation systems the full colour table
is used to draw images.  This has the disadvantage that if you want to
annotate images with captions or axes, plot coloured borders about
images, plot graphs {\it etc.}\, yet simultaneously display images with
certain colour tables, there may be conflict of interests. For instance,
a linear greyscale colour table's first few pens will be almost
black. By default, these same pens, particularly pen 1, are used by
the graphics system for line graphics, thus any plots will be invisible.
If you reset colour pen 1 to white, the appearance of your image
alters. Whenever you alter the colour table to enhance the look of your
image, it will affect the line graphics.

To circumvent this dilemma, {\footnotesize KAPPA} reserves a portion of the
colour table, called the {\em palette}, that is unaffected by changes
to the rest of the colour table. It is shown schematically below.  The
palette currently contains a fixed 16 pens.  $N$ is the total
number of pens.  In {\footnotesize KAPPA} the remainder of the pens 
is called the {\em colour table}. It is easy to confuse this use of the
term {\em colour table}, with the PGPLOT colour table described above. To
sumarize again, in {\footnotesize KAPPA} the ``colour table'' is that
part of the PGPLOT colour table which has not been reserved for annotation
(\emph{i.e.} the whole colour table minus the first 16 pens which form the
annotation \emph{pallette}). The context should usually make it obvious
which understanding of the phrase ``colour table'' is being used.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_lookuptables}Lookup Tables\label{se:lookuptables}}

A list of colours to be allocated to each pen in the colour table is
called a \emph{lookup table}. Lookup tables comprise a series of red,
green and blue (RGB) intensities, each normalised to 1.0; they may be
stored in NDFs---indeed some are provided with {\footnotesize KAPPA}---or
be coded within applications.

A lookup table may be transferred into the display's colour table.
However, the number of pens in the colour table is usually not the
same as the number of colours in the lookup table and so a simple
substitution is not possible.  Therefore, {\footnotesize KAPPA} squeezes
or stretches the lookup table to make it fit in the available number of
colour-table pens. Normally, linear interpolation between adjacent
lookup-table entries defines the resultant colour, though you can select
a nearest-neighbour algorithm.  The latter is suited to lookup tables
with sharp boundaries between contrasting colours, {\it{e.g.}}\ a series of
coloured blocks, and the former to smoothly varying lookup tables where
there are no obvious discontinuities, {\it{e.g.}}\ spectrum-like.

Let's have a few examples.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % lutheat
     % lutramps
     % lutread pastel
     % lutable li ex sawtooth nn
     % lutsave pirated
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\htmlref{LUTHEAT}{LUTHEAT} loads the standard `heat' lookup table into
the colour table using linear interpolation, whilst
\htmlref{LUTRAMPS}{LUTRAMPS} loads the standard coloured ramps using
the nearest neighbours in the lookup table.
\htmlref{LUTREAD}{LUTREAD} reads the lookup table stored in the
DATA\_ARRAY of the NDF called pastel and maps it onto the colour table
via linear interpolation.  In the fourth example the lookup table in
NDF sawtooth is mapped onto the colour table via a linear
nearest-neighbour method. {\tt ex} tells \htmlref{LUTABLE}{LUTABLE} to
read an external file.  In the final example
\htmlref{LUTSAVE}{LUTSAVE} saves the current colour table into a
lookup-table NDF called pirated. LUTSAVE is quite useful as you can
steal other people's attractive colour tables that they've carelessly
left in the display's memory!  It does not matter should the display
not have a palette, since

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> lutsave pirated full
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
will save the full set of pens (including the first 16) to the NDF.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_mancoltab}Manipulating Colour Tables
\label{se:mancoltab}}
\htmlref{LUTEDIT}{LUTEDIT} provides a complete graphical-user-interface which
allows colour tables to be created or modified in many different ways.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_creluts}Creating Lookup Tables\label{se:creluts}}

\subsubsection{From a Text File}
You can make a text file of the RGB intensities and use
\htmlref{TRANDAT}{TRANDAT} to create the \NDFref{NDF}, or manipulate
the colour table and then save it in a lookup-table NDF.  If you
choose the second option remember that all RGB intensities must lie in
the range 0.0--1.0, where 1.0 is the maximum intensity; and that equal
red, green, and blue intensities yields a shade of grey. So for
example if you want a six equal blocks of red, blue, yellow, pink,
sienna and turquoise you could create the text file {\tt col6.dat}
with contents

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     # Red, blue, yellow, pink, sienna, and turquoise LUT
     1.0 0.0 0.0
     0.0 0.0 1.0
     1.0 1.0 0.0
     0.9 0.56 0.56
     0.56 0.42 0.14
     0.68 0.92 0.92
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and then run TRANDAT to make the NDF called collut6.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % trandat col6 collut6 shape='[3,6]' auto
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_runlutedit}Running LUTEDIT\label{se:runlutedit}}

There is an interactive task called \htmlref{LUTEDIT}{LUTEDIT} for
creating and editing lookup tables. The LUTEDIT command fires up a
complete graphical-user-interface, which includes its own help system 
via a "short help" window at the bottom of the interface which describes
the control currently under the pointer, and also via the usual "Help"
button at the right hand end of the menu bar.

 
\subsection{\xlabel{se_palette}Palette\label{se:palette}}

There are four commands for controlling the
\htmlref{palette}{se:coltab}\latexonly{ (Section~\ref{se:coltab})}, all
beginning PAL.  If you inherit the graphics device after a non-{\footnotesize
KAPPA} user or after a device reset, you will probably have to reset
the palette.  You can do this either by loading the default
palette---black, white, the primary then secondary colours, and eight
equally spaced grey levels---with the command \htmlref{PALDEF}{PALDEF};
or load a palette you've created yourself via \htmlref{PALREAD}{PALREAD}.
You modify the palette by changing individual colours within it using
\htmlref{PALENTRY}{PALENTRY}.  The colour
specification can be a \htmlref{named colour}{ap:colset}
\latexonly{(see Appendix~\ref{ap:colset} for a list)}, or RGB intensities.
For example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % palentry 1 Skyblue
     % palentry 14 [1.0,1.0,0.3]
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would make palette index 1 sky blue and index 14 a pale yellow.  Once
you have a palette you like, save it in an NDF with
\htmlref{PALSAVE}{PALSAVE}.  

Palette entry 0 is the background colour. By choosing a palette colour
equal to the background colour, features may be `erased'.

\subsection{Persistence of Palettes and Colour Tables}
PGPLOT re-initializes the palette and colour table each time it is
started up, wiping out the colours you had previously selected with such
care! For this reason, KAPPA keeps a copy of the ``current'' palette and
colour table in a special file. Each time a graphics application is run,
the current colour table and palette are read back from this file, and
used to reset the pen colours in the PGPLOT colour table before any
drawing is performed. Some application change the colour table or palette;
PALENTRY, LUTABLE, {\em etc.}. When such applications terminates, they
write the modified colour table or palette back to the file so that it will
be used by subsequent graphics applications.

Separate palettes and colour tables are maintained for each known
graphics device, so running LUTGREY on an xwindows device will have no
effect on the colour table used for postscript devices (for instance).
The palettes for all known devices are stored in a file called {\tt
kappa\_palette.sdf} located within your ADAM directory (usually
\$HOME/adam). The colour tables for all known devices are stored in a
file called {\tt kappa\_lut.sdf} located within the same directory.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{se_masking}Masking, Bad Values, and Quality\label{se:masking}}

{\em Masking\/} is the process by which you can exclude portions of
your data from data processing or analysis.  Suppose that you are
doing surface photometry of a bright galaxy, part of the data reduction
is to measure the background contribution around the galaxy and to
subtract it.  You usually want to avoid inclusion of light from the galaxy
in your estimation of the background.  A convenient method for doing
this is to mask the galaxy during the background fitting.

There are two techniques used for masking.  One employs special {\em
bad\/} values (also known as {\em magic\/} or {\em invalid\/} values).
These appear within the data or variance arrays in place of the actual
values, and indicate that the pixel is to be ignored or is undefined.
They are destructive\footnote{That is, the special bad value replaces the
original data values, and so the original data values are lost.} and so
some people don't like them, but you can always mask your data into a
new, temporary NDF.  With a little care, bad values are quite effective
and they are used throughout {\footnotesize KAPPA}.  By its nature, a bad
value can only indicate a logical, two-state condition about a data
element---it is either good or bad---and so this technique is sometimes
called {\em flagging}.

In contrast, the second technique, uses a quality array.  This permits
many more attributes or qualities of the data to be associated with each
pixel.  In the current implementation there may be up to 255 integer
values, or 8 single-bit logical flags.  Thus quality can be regarded as
offering 8 logical masks extending over the data or variance arrays, and
can signify the presence or absence of a particular property if the bit
has value 1 or 0 respectively.  An application of quality to satellite
data might include the detector used to measure the value, some indicator
of the time each pixel was observed, was the observation made within the
Earth's radiation belts, and whether or not the pixel contains a reseau
mark.  By selecting only those data with the appropriate quality values,
you process only the data with the desired properties.  This can be very
powerful.  However, it does have the drawback of having to store at least
an extra byte per pixel in your NDF.

The two methods are {\em not\/} mutually exclusive; the NDF permits
their simultaneous use in a dataset.

Now we'll look at both of these techniques in detail and demonstrating
the relevant {\footnotesize KAPPA} tasks.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_badmasking}Bad-pixel Masking\label{se:badmasking}}

Bad pixels are flagged with the Starlink standard values (see
Section~5 of \xref{SUN/39}{sun39}{}), which for
\htmlref{\_REAL}{ap:HDStypes} is the most-negative value possible.

In addition to tasks which routinely create bad values in the output
value is undefined, {\footnotesize KAPPA} offers many applications for
flagging pixels with certain properties or locations.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_ardwork}Doing it the ARD Way\label{se:ardwork}}

To mask a region or a series of regions within an NDF, you can
create an \xref{ASCII Region Definition}{sun183}{} (ARD) file.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % cat myard.ard
     COFRAME(PIXEL)
     PIXEL( 23.5, -17.2 )
     ELLIPSE( 75.2, 296.6, 33, 16, 78 ) 
     POLYGON( 110, 115, 123, 132, 130, 125 )
     CIRCLE( 10, 10, 40 ) .AND. .NOT. CIRCLE( 10, 10, 30 )
     COFRAME(SKY,SYSTEM=FK5,EQUINOX=2000)
     CIRCLE( 10:09:12.2, -45:12:13, ::40 ) 
     CTRL/D
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

In this example, the regions are: the pixel with index [24,~$-$17] (note
the rounding of \emph{pixel co-ordinates} to \emph{pixel indices}), an
ellipse centred at (75.2,~296.6) with semi-major axis of 33 pixels and
semi-minor axis of 16 pixels, at orientation 78\dgs\ clockwise from the
$x$ axis, and an annulus centred on pixel co-ordinates (10.0,~10.0)
between radius 30 and 40 pixels. a circle centred on RA 10:09:12.2, and
DEC -45:12:13 of radius 40 arc-seconds. The COFRAME statements indicate
the coordinate system in which subsequent positions are supplied. There
are several other keywords besides those shown here.  ARD has powerful
syntax for combining regions and supplying WCS information, described
fully in \xref{SUN/183}{sun183}{}, But you'll be relieved to learn that
there is a shortcut...

If you are dealing with 2-dimensional data, {\footnotesize KAPPA} offers an
interactive graphical tool for generating ARD files.  To use
\htmlref{ARDGEN}{ARDGEN} you must first display your data on a device
with a cursor, such as an X-terminal.  \htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY}
with a greyscale lookup table is probably best for doing that.
The grey lets you see the coloured overlays clearly. The following
example assumes that the current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF is PIXEL 
({\em i.e.} pixel co-ordinates). Consequently all positions are shown
below in pixel co-ordinates. If the current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF 
was not PIXEL but (say) SKY, then ARDGEN would produce positions in SKY
co-ordinates. The ARD file generated by ARDGEN always contains a description 
of the co-ordinate system in which positions are specified, allowing later
applications to interpret them correctly, and convert them (if necessary)
into other co-ordinate systems.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % ardgen demo.ard
     Current picture has name: DATA, comment: KAPPA_DISPLAY.
     SHAPE - Region shape /'CIRCLE'/ >
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
At this point you can select a shape.  Enter {\tt ?} to get the
list.  Once you've selected a shape you'll receive instructions.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     SHAPE - Region shape /'COLUMN'/ > ellipse

 Region type is "ELLIPSE". Identify the centre, then one end of the semi-major
 axis, and finally one other point on the ellipse.

    To select a position press the space bar or left mouse button
    To exit press "." or the right mouse button
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Once you have defined one ellipse, you can define another or exit to
the OPTION prompt.  In addition to keyboard 1, pressing the right-hand
mouse button has the same effect.  Thus in the example, the new shape is
a rotated box.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     Region completed. Identify another 'ELLIPSE' region...
     OPTION - Next operation to perform /'SHAPE'/ > shape
     SHAPE - Region shape /'ELLIPSE'/ > rotbox


     Region type is "ROTBOX". Identify the two end points of any edge and then give
     a point on the opposite edge.

If you make a mistake, use the ``Undo'' option. Alternatively, enter {\tt
List} at the OPTION prompt to see a list of the regions.  Note the
``Region Index'' of the region(s) you wish to remove, and select the {\tt

Now suppose you want to combine or invert regions in some way, you
supply {\tt Combine} at the OPTION prompt.  So suppose we have
created the following regions in {\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/ccdframe}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}

                         233.4, 247.7,
                         233.4, 258.6,
                         231, 267,
                         229.8, 265.8,

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We want to form the region inside the first ellipse but not inside
the second.  This done in two stages.  First we invert the second
ellipse, meaning that pixels are included if they are not inside
this ellipse, by combining with the {\tt NOT} operator.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     OPTION - Next operation to perform /'SHAPE'/ > comb
     OPERATOR - How to combine the regions /'AND'/ > not  
     OPERANDS - Indices of regions to combine or invert /6/ > 2
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This removes the original region 2, decrements the region numbers of
the other regions following 2 by one, so that region 3 becomes 2, 4
becomes 3, and so on.  A new region 7 is the inverted ellipse. The
renumbering makes it worth listing the regions before combining
regions.  The second stage is to combine it with region 1, using the
{\tt AND} operator.  This includes pixels if they are in both regions.
In this example, that means all the pixels outside the second ellipse
but which lie within the first.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    OPTION - Next operation to perform /'SHAPE'/ > com
    OPERATOR - How to combine the regions /'AND'/ > 
    OPERANDS - Indices of regions to combine or invert /[6,7]/ > 1,6
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Here is another example of combination.  This creates a region for
pixels are included provided they are in one of two regions, but not
in both.  Here we apply the {\tt XOR} operator to the small ellipse
and the first rotated box.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     OPTION - Next operation to perform /'SHAPE'/ > comb
     OPERATOR - How to combine the regions /'AND'/ > xor
     OPERANDS - Indices of regions to combine or invert /[4,5]/ > 1,2

Here is the final set of regions.

Once you are done, enter {\tt "Exit"} at the OPTION prompt, and the
ARD file is created.  {\tt "Quit"} also leaves the programme, but
the ARD file is not made.

Having created the ARD file it is straightforward to generate a
masked image with \htmlref{ARDMASK}{ARDMASK}\footnote{You can also plot the
outline of the selected regions on top of a display image using 
\htmlref{ARDPLOT}{ARDPLOT}.}:

\small
\begin{verbatim}

define a colour for bad pixels using the BADCOL parameter.

\begin{verbatim}
     % display ardccdmask badcol=red \\

\normalsize
To the right of Figure~
\latexelsehtml{\ref{fi:ardwork}}{8} is the final masked image.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_badsegment}SEGMENT and
ZAPLIN\label{se:badsegment}}

\htmlref{SEGMENT}{SEGMENT} is ostensibly for copying polygonal regions
from one NDF to another.  You may also use SEGMENT to copy bad pixels
into the polygonal regions by giving the null value for one of the two
input NDFs. For instance,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % segment in1=! in2=$KAPPA_DIR/ccdframec out=ccdmask
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
NDF ccdmask will have bad values inside the polygons, whereas

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % segment in2=! in1=$KAPPA_DIR/ccdframec out=ccdmask
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
the pixels exterior to the polygons are flagged.  SEGMENT lets you
define the polygon vertices interactively, like in
\htmlref{ARDGEN}{ARDGEN}, but you can also use text files, or respond
to prompting.

\htmlref{ZAPLIN}{ZAPLIN} also has an option to fill in rectangular
areas when parameter ZAPTYPE has value {\tt Bad}.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_badspecial}Special Filters for Inserting Bad Values
\label{se:badspecial}}

There are applications that mask pixels if their values meet certain
criteria.

\htmlref{SETMAGIC}{SETMAGIC} flags those pixels with a nominated
value.  It is most useful during conversion of imported data whose
data system uses \htmlref{bad-pixel}{se:masking} values different from
Starlink's.

\htmlref{FFCLEAN}{FFCLEAN} removes defects smaller than a nominated
size from an image or vector \NDFref{NDF}.  It flags those pixels that
deviate from a smoothed version of the NDF by more than some number of
standard deviations from the local mean.

\htmlref{ERRCLIP}{ERRCLIP} flags pixels that have errors larger than
some supplied limit or signal-to-noise ratios below a threshold.  The
errors come from the \htmlref{VARIANCE}{apndf:variance} component of the NDF. 
Thus you can exclude unreliable data from analysis.

% The filtering applications have a WLIM parameter

\subsection{\xlabel{se_qualitymask}Quality Masking\label{se:qualitymask}}

All the \NDFref{NDF}\ tasks in {\footnotesize KAPPA} use quality yet there is
no obvious sign in individual applications how particular values of
\htmlref{quality}{se:masking} are selected.  What gives?  The meanings
attached to the quality bits will inevitably be quite specific for
specialist software packages, but {\footnotesize KAPPA} tasks aim to be
general purpose.  To circumvent this conflict there is an NDF
component called the {\em bad-bits mask} that forms part of the
quality information.  Like a QUALITY value, the bad-bits mask is an
unsigned byte.  Its purpose is to convert the eight quality flags into
a single logical value for each pixel, which can then be processed
just like a bad pixel.

When data are read from the NDF by mapping into memory, the quality of
each pixel is combined with the bad-bits mask; if a result of this
quality masking is {\tt FALSE}, that pixel is assigned the bad value for
processing.  This does not change the original values stored in the NDF;
it only affects the mapped data.

So how do the quality and bad-bits mask combine to form a logical
value?  They form the bit-wise `AND' and test it for equality for 0.
None the wiser?  Regard each bit in the bad-bits mask as a switch
to activate detection of the corresponding bit in a pixel's quality.
The switch is on if it has value 1, and is off if it has value 0.
Thus if the pixel is flagged only if one or more of the 8 bits
has both quality and the corresponding bad-bit set to 1.  Here
are some examples:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
QUALITY:  & 10000001 & 10000001 \\
Bad-bits: & 01000100 & 01000101 \\
Bits on:  &          &       \^{} \\
Result:   & TRUE     & FALSE \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The application \htmlref{SETBB}{SETBB} allows you to modify the
bad-bits mask in an NDF.  It allows you to specify the bit pattern in
a number of ways including decimal and binary as illustrated below.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setbb RO950124 5
     % setbb RO950124 b101
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
These both set the bad-bits mask to 00000101 for the NDF RO950124.
SETBB also allows you to combine an existing NDF bad-bits mask with
another mask using the operators AND and OR.  OR lets you switch on
additional bits without affecting those already on; AND lets you turn
off selected bits leaving the rest unchanged.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setbb RO950124 b00010001 or
     % setbb RO950124 b11101110 and
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The first example sets bits 1 and 5 but leaves the other bits of
the mask unaltered, whereas the second switches off the same bits.

Now remembering which bit corresponds to which could be a strain on
the memory.  It would be better if some meaning was attached to each
bit through a name.  There are four general tasks in the
\IRASref\ package which address this. [We plan to integrate them into the
more-natural home of the {\footnotesize NDFPACK} sub-package of {\footnotesize KAPPA}.]
SETQUAL sets quality values and names; SHOWQUAL lists the named qualities;
REMQUAL removes named qualities; and QUALTOBAD uses a logical expression
containing the named quality properties to create a copy of your NDF
in which pixels satisfying the quality expression are set bad.
See Section~4.3 of \xref{SUN/163}{sun163}{} for details.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_removebad}Removing bad pixels\label{se:removebad}}

Sometimes having bad pixels present in your data is a nuisance, say
because some application outside of {\footnotesize KAPPA} does not
recognise them, or you want to integrate the flux of a source.
{\footnotesize KAPPA} offers a number of options for removing bad
values.  Which of these is appropriate depends on the reason why you
want to remove the bad pixels.

First you could replace the bad values with some other reasonable value,
such as zero.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % nomagic old new 0 comp=all
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Here dataset new is the same as dataset old except that any bad value
in the data or variance array has now become zero.

If you wanted some representative value used based upon neighbouring
pixels, use the \htmlref{GLITCH}{GLITCH} command.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % glitch old new mode=bad
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This replaces the bad values in the data and variance arrays with the median 
of the eight neighbouring pixels.  This works
fine for isolated bad pixels but not for large blocks.  If your data are
generally flat, large areas can be replaced using the
\htmlref{FILLBAD}{FILLBAD} task.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fillbad old new size=4
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The value of parameter SIZE should be about half the diameter of the
largest region of bad pixels.  Both the data array and variance arrays
are filled.

You may replace individual pixels or rectangular sections using
\htmlref{CHPIX}{CHPIX}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % chpix old new
     SECTION - Section to be set to a constant /'55,123'/ >
     NEWVAL - New value for the section /'60'/ >
     SECTION - Section to be set to a constant /'1:30,-10:24'/ >
     NEWVAL - New value for the section /'-1'/ >
     SECTION - Section to be set to a constant /'1:30,-10:24'/ > !
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This replaces pixel (55,~123) with value 60, and the region from
(1,~$-$10) to (30,~24) with $-$1.  The final {\tt !} ends the loop of
replacements.  If you supply NEWVAL on the command line, only one
replacement occurs. 

It is also possible to paste other datasets where your bad values lie
with the \htmlref{PASTE}{PASTE} and \htmlref{SEGMENT}{SEGMENT} tasks.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % paste old fudge"(10:20,29:30)" out=new
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The dataset old is a copy of dataset new, except in the 22-pixel region
(10,~29) to (20,~30), where the values originate from the fudge dataset.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{se_multinvoc}Processing Groups of Data Files\label{se:multinvoc}}
When a {\footnotesize KAPPA} application requests an input or output data
file (either an NDF or a positions list), you may optionally give a 
group of several data files rather than just one. In this case, the 
application is automatically re-run until all the supplied data files have 
been processed. For instance, in the following command:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % display in="../a*" mode=perc accept 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

a group of NDFs (all those beginning with ``a'' in the parent directory)
are assigned to the IN parameter, and the \htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY} command 
is automatically re-run to display each NDF in the fashion of a (rather
slow!) movie.

Another example:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % stats ndf=^files
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

will display the pixel statistics of all NDFs listed within the text file 
\verb+files+. The ``\verb+^+'' character indicates that the following
string (\verb+files+) is not the name of an NDF, but the name of a text 
file from which NDF names should be read. 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % wcsframe '"image_a,image_b,image_c"' sky
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This will set the current co-ordinate Frame for the three NDFs
\verb+image_a+, \verb+image_b+ and \verb+image_c+ so that celestial sky
co-ordinates are used to refer to positions within the NDFs, if possible.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % cursor outcat="'first,^list_names'"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This will run \htmlref{CURSOR}{CURSOR} several times, allowing the user
to select display positions using a cursor. On the first invocation,  
the selected positions are written to a positions list stored in file 
\verb+first.FIT+. Positions selected on subsequent invocations are
written to positions lists with names read from the text file
\verb+list_names+. Finally, if this CURSOR command is followed by:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % listshow accept
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\htmlref{LISTSHOW}{LISTSHOW} will display the contents of all the
catalogues created previously by CURSOR.

If an application has more than one NDF or positions list parameter, each
parameter should be given the same number of values (\emph{i.e.} data
files). A warning is issued if any parameter is given too many values, but
processing continues normally until the smallest group is exhausted. For
instance, the following example adds NDF \verb+a1+ to \verb+a2+, and
\verb+b1+ to \verb+b2+, putting the results in \verb+a3+ and \verb+b3+:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % add in1="'a1,b1'" in2="'a2,b2'" out="'a3,b3'"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
 
If (say) an extra NDF had been specified for parameter IN2, the
application would have been invoked twice to process the first two
pairs, and then a warning message would have been displayed saying that
too many NDFs were specified for parameter IN2.

There is a special case in which this rule does not apply. If only a
\emph{single} value is given for an data file parameter, the same value
is used repeatedly on all invocations of the application. So, for
instance, if a single NDF had been given for parameter IN2 in the above
ADD example, the application would have again been run twice, using the
same NDF for parameter IN2 on each invocation.

The OUT parameter in the above example could alternatively have been
specified as \verb+out="'*|1|3|'"+. Here, the asterisk (*) represents the
base-names, \verb+a1+ and \verb+b1+, of the NDFs supplied for the first
NDF parameter to be accessed (IN1). The following string, \verb+|1|3|+,
means ``replace all occurrences of 1 with 3'', thus giving the final NDF
names \verb+a3+ and \verb+b3+.

\subsection{Applications which Process Groups of NDFs}
The majority of applications with NDF parameters use each NDF parameter
to access a \emph{single} NDF, and supplying more than one NDF will
result in the application being re-run as described above. The
application then accesses a single NDF on each invocation. Some
applications, however, have NDF parameters which are explicitly described
in the reference section of this document as being associated with a
\emph{group} of NDFs. An example is WCSALIGN which has a parameter IN
which reads a \emph{group} of NDFs which are to be aligned with each
other. Such applications process all the specified NDFs in a single
invocation. For the purposes of the multiple invocation scheme described
above, such parameters are not considered to be ``NDF'' parameters, and
will not cause the application to be re-run.

\subsection{What about the other Parameters?}
When an application is re-run to process multiple data files, all the
parameters not associated with NDFs or positions lists retain their
values from one invocation to the next. So, for instance, the assignment
for the MODE Parameter in the earlier \htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY} example is
retained and used for all subsequent invocations of the application, you
are not prompted for a new value each time the application runs.

This is usually what you want, but beware that there \emph{are} times
when this behaviour may trip you up. Sometimes an application may prompt
for a new parameter value while in the middle of processing a group of
NDFs. This can occur for instance, if the initial value you supplied on
the first invocation is inappropriate for the NDF currently being
processed. For instance, supposing you use \htmlref{WCSFRAME}{WCSFRAME}
to set the current co-ordinate Frame to SKY for a group of NDFs. To do
this, you would set the FRAME Parameter to SKY either on the command line
or when prompted during the first invocation. This value would be
retained for subsequent invocations, but what happens if one of the NDFs
does not have a SKY Frame defined in its WCS component? Not surprisingly,
you get an error message identifying the NDF, and you are asked to supply a
new value for FRAME. You could, for instance supply ``PIXEL'' as the new
value. This changes the current value of the FRAME parameter to PIXEL,
and this value will consequently be used for any remaining NDFs.

If you do not specify a value for a parameter, the default value used by
the first invocation will be re-used for all subsequent invocations. Note
that the default value for some parameters (for instance the CENTRE
parameter of the DISPLAY command) is the null value ``!''. This is
usually interpreted as a request for the application to find an
appropriate value itself for the parameter. In these cases, the parameter
\emph{value} is ``!'' and is re-used on all invocations, resulting in the
application finding and using a potentially different value on each
invocation. So, for instance, the above DISPLAY example will find and use
an appropriate CENTRE value for each displayed image. If you want to use
the same CENTRE value for all images you should specify it explicitly on
the command line, for instance:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % display in="../a*" mode=perc centre="'12:00:00 -32:00:00'" accept 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{Output Parameters}
If you tried out the examples at the start of this section, you may be
wondering what happened about the output parameters for STATS. The
\htmlref{STATS}{STATS} application writes the various statistics it
calculates to lots of output parameters which can be used by subsequent
applications. If an application is re-run several times to process
different data files then the values left in the application's output
parameters will be the values created on the \emph{last} invocation of the
application.

\subsection{What Happens if an Error Occurs?}
If an application fails to execute successfully, the error report will be 
displayed, and then canceled.\footnote{This is called ``flushing'' the error.}
This means that any remaining NDFs will continued to be processed normally.

The exception to this is that if the error is an ``abort request''
(caused by the user supplying two exclamation marks for a parameter), then 
the loop exits immediately. That is, no remaining NDFs are processed.

\subsection{What about Applications which Re-use Parameters?}
Some applications use a single parameter to obtain a series of values from
the user. Examples are the INIT parameter of \htmlref{CENTROID}{CENTROID}
and the OPTION parameter of \htmlref{SETEXT}{SETEXT}. Remembering that
parameters which are not associated with either an NDF or a positions
list retain their values between invocations, it is not surprising that
care is needed when using such application to process groups of NDFs. For
instance, when using CENTROID you supply a null parameter value
(\emph{i.e.} a single exclamation mark ``!'') as the final value for the
INIT parameter to indicate that you do not wish to find any more
centroids. Since parameter values are retained between invocations when
processing groups of NDFs, this null value becomes the first value to be
used by any subsequent invocation. The next invocation of CENTROID finds
INIT set to a null value, assumes that no more centroids are to be found,
and exits immediately! The same goes for all subsequent invocations until
the group of NDFs has been exhausted.

The only way (currently) to avoid this behaviour is to specify the INIT
parameter value on the command line. CENTROID takes this as an indication
that you only want to find a single centroid, and so does not attempt to
get a new value for INIT, thus leaving the supplied value for the next
invocation. The same value for INIT is thus used by all invocations. Of
course, this means you can only find a single centroid in each
NDF.\footnote{If this is a problem, you can always put the INIT values
into a file or positions list, using a different value for the MODE
parameter.}

Most applications which re-use one or more parameters during a single
invocation have some similar means of indicating that you do not want to
be prompted for a new value. For some (like CENTROID), putting the
parameter value on the command line accomplishes this. Some others (such
as SETEXT) have a LOOP parameter which can be set FALSE to indicate that
parameters should not be accessed more than once. The reference
documentation for each command should be consulted for details.

\subsection{Introducing a Pause Between Invocations}
Sometimes you may want to slow down the speed at which data files are
processed. For instance, if you display several small images using a
single DISPLAY command, you may want time to examine each image before
moving on to the next. You can introduce a delay between invocations
by setting the shell environment variable KAPPA\_LOOP\_DELAY to the
required delay time (in units of seconds). For instance, in the
C-shell:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % setenv KAPPA_LOOP_DELAY 2.5
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

causes a delay of 2.5 seconds between invocations of any {\footnotesize KAPPA} 
command. To remove the delay, you should undefined KAPPA\_LOOP\_DELAY. In 
C-shell:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % unsetenv KAPPA_LOOP_DELAY
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{Reporting the Data Files being Processed}
When processing a single data file, some applications report the name of 
the file and some do not. Normally, no extra information is given
when processing groups of data files. This means that sometimes you get
to see the names of the files as they are processed, and some times
you do not. It just depends on the application.

However, it is often very useful to see the names of the files as they are 
processed. For instance, if an error occurs processing one of the files,
it is useful to know which file failed. If the application doesn't display
this information, then you can force it to by setting the shell
environment variable KAPPA\_REPORT\_NAMES to an arbitrary
value.\footnote{The actual value does not matter.} For instance, in the
C-shell:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % setenv KAPPA_REPORT_NAMES 1
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This causes the value used for each data file parameter to be displayed in the
form ``\verb+parameter = value+'' on each invocation. To go back to the
normal, quiet reporting scheme, you should undefined KAPPA\_REPORT\_NAMES.
In C-shell:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % unsetenv KAPPA_REPORT_NAMES
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{The Syntax for Specifying Groups of Data Files}

The group of NDFs or positions lists to be used for a given parameter is
specified by a \emph{group expression}. This is also the syntax used to
give groups of plotting attributes when specifying graphics STYLE
parameters. The group expression syntax is described
\hyperref{here}{in section }{}{se:groups}.

A group of output data files may be specified by modifying the names of a
corresponding set of input data files. This is easy enough when the
application only has one parameter for input data files, but what happens
if more than one parameter is associated with a group of input data
files? Which parameter is used to define the group of input data files on
which the names of the output data files are based? The answer is ``the
first one to be accessed''. For instance, \htmlref{ADD}{ADD} takes two
input NDFs, adds them together and produces a single output NDF. When
running ADD, you are prompted first for parameter IN1, and then for
parameter IN2, and finally for parameter OUT. Thus, if you give the
string ``\verb+a_*+'' for OUT, the names of the output NDFs will be
derived from the NDFs supplied for parameter IN1, because IN1 is accessed
first (\emph{i.e.} prompted for \emph{before} IN2).

Note, when choosing the input parameter on which output data files are
based, no significance is attached to whether the input and output file
types match. That is, the first input parameter to be accessed if used,
irrespective of whether it is associated with an NDF or a positions list.

A feature which may sometimes be useful is the facility for providing a
shell command in response to a prompt for a group of data files. To do
this, enclose the command within the usual backward quotes (\verb+`+), as
you would when substituting the output from a command into another shell 
command. The command should generate a set of explicit file names, with
file types. Note, you will need to escape any characters which are
normally interpreted as part of the syntax of a group expression, such as
``\verb+|+'' or ``\verb+,+'', by preceding them with a backslash
``\verb+\+''.

\subsection{Using non-NDF Data Formats}

In addition to processing Starlink NDF structures, {\footnotesize KAPPA}
can also process many non-NDF (``foreign'') data files. This is achieved
through \htmlref{`on-the-fly conversion'}{se:autoconvert} (see
\latexonly{Section~\ref{se:autoconvert} and} \xref{SUN/55}{sun55}{}).

When this scheme is in use, you need not include explicit file types for
all input file names. If no file type is given, the file with the highest
priority file type amongst all files with the specified base name will be 
used. The priority of a file type is determined by its position within the 
list of file types given by \htmlref{NDF\_FORMATS\_IN}{se:autoconvert} 
environment variable \latexonly{(see Section~\ref{se:autoconvert})}. File 
types near the start of the list have higher priority than those which
follow. Note, native NDF files always have the highest priority and will
be used (if they exist) in preference to all other files types.

\subsection{Disabling Multiple Invocations of Applications}
In certain circumstances, you may possibly want to disable the automatic
re-invocation of {\footnotesize KAPPA} applications to process groups of 
data files. This can be done by setting the environment variable 
KAPPA\_LOOP\_DISABLE to an arbitrary value.\footnote{The actual value does 
not matter.} For instance, in the C-shell:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % setenv KAPPA_LOOP_DISABLE 1
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

will cause all NDF and positions list parameters to accept only a single
data file, and each application will be run only once. Note, the extra
facilities for specifying data files provided by the group expression
syntax will not then be available. To re-enable looping, you should
undefine KAPPA\_LOOP\_DISABLE. In C-shell:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % unsetenv KAPPA_LOOP_DISABLE
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\section{\xlabel{se_datainput}Getting Data into KAPPA\label{se:datainput}}

{\footnotesize KAPPA} utilises general data structures within an
\HDSref\ container file, with file extension {\tt .sdf}.  Most of
the examples in this documentation processing is performed on data in
this \NDFref{NDF}\ format generated from within {\footnotesize KAPPA}.
Generally, you will already have data in `foreign' formats, that is
formats other than the Starlink standard, particularly in the
\FITSref\ (Flexible Image Transport System),
\IRAFref , and \Figaroref\ DST formats.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_autoconvert}Automatic Conversion
\label{se:autoconvert}}

Although {\footnotesize KAPPA} tasks do not work directly with `foreign'
formats, they can made to appear that they do.  What happens is that
the format is converted `on-the-fly' to a scratch NDF, which is then
processed by {\footnotesize KAPPA}.  If the processing creates an output NDF
or modifies the scratch NDF, this may be back-converted `on-the-fly'
too, and not necessarily to the original data format.  At the end, the
scratch NDF is deleted.  So for example you could have an IRAF image
file, use BLOCK to filter the array, and output the resultant array as
a FITS file.

We must first define the names of the recognised formats and a file
extension associated with each format.  In practice you'll most likely
do this with the \xref{{\tt convert}}{sun55}{} command, which
creates these definitions for many popular formats.  The
file extension determines in which format a file is written.  There is
an environment variable called NDF\_FORMATS\_IN which defines the
allowed formats in a comma-separated list with the file extensions in
parentheses.  Here is an example.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setenv NDF_FORMATS_IN 'FITS(.fit),IRAF(.imh),FIGARO(.dst)'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Once defined it lets you run {\footnotesize KAPPA} tasks on FITS,
{\footnotesize IRAF}, or {\footnotesize FIGARO} files, like
\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % stats m51.fit
     % stats m51.dst
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would compute the statistics of a FITS file {\tt m51.fit}, and then
a {\footnotesize FIGARO} file {\tt m51.dst}.

The environment variable also defines a search order.  Had you entered

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % stats m51
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\htmlref{STATS}{STATS} would first look for an NDF called m51 (stored in file {\tt
m51.sdf}). If it could not locate that NDF, STATS would then look for
a file called {\tt m51.fit}, and then {\tt m51.imh}, and finally {\tt
m51.dst}, stopping once a file was found and associating the
appropriate format with it. If none of the files exist, you'll receive
a ``file not found'' error message.

You can still define an
\latexelsehtml{NDF section (see Section~\ref{se:ndfsect})}{\htmlref{NDF
section}{se:ndfsect}} when you access an existing data file in a foreign
format.  Thus

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % stats m51.imh"(100:200,200~81)"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would derive the statistics for $x$ pixels between 100 and 200, and
$y$ pixels 160 to 240 in the {\footnotesize IRAF} file {\tt m51.imh}.

The conversion tasks may be your own for some private format, but
normally they will come from the
\xref{{\footnotesize CONVERT} package}{sun55}{}\latexonly{ (SUN/55)}.  If you want
to learn how to add conversions to the standard ones, you should
consult \xref{SSN/20}{ssn20}{}.

There is an environment variable that defines the format of new data
files.  This could be assigned the same value as NDF\_FORMATS\_OUT,
though they don't have to be.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setenv NDF_FORMATS_OUT 'FITS(.fit),IRAF(.imh),FIGARO(.dst)'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
If you supply the file extension when a {\footnotesize KAPPA} task creates a
new dataset, and it appears in NDF\_FORMATS\_OUT, you'll get a file in
that format.  So for instance,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % ffclean in=m51.dst out=m51_cleaned.dst \\
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

cleans {\tt m51.dst} and stores the result in {\tt m51\_cleaned.dst}.
On the other hand, if you only give the dataset name
\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % ffclean in=m51.dst out=m51_cleaned \\
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
the output dataset would be the first in the NDF\_FORMATS\_OUT list.
Thus if you want to work predominantly in a foreign format, place it
first in the NDF\_FORMATS\_IN and NDF\_FORMATS\_OUT lists.

If you want to create an output NDF, you must insert a full stop at the
head of the list.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setenv NDF_FORMATS_OUT '.,FITS(.fit),IRAF(.imh),FIGARO(.dst)'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This is the recommended behaviour.  If you just want to propagate the
input data format, insert an asterisk at the start of the output-format
list.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setenv NDF_FORMATS_OUT '*,.,FITS(.fit),IRAF(.imh),FIGARO(.dst)'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This only affects applications which create a dataset using information
propagated from an existing dataset.  For instance, if the above
NDF\_FORMATS\_OUT were defined,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % ffclean in=m51.dst out=m51_cleaned \\
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would now create {\tt m51\_cleaned.dst}.  If there is no propagation
in the given application, the asterisk is ignored. 

You can retain the scratch NDF by setting the environment variable
NDF\_KEEP to 1.  This is useful if you intend to work mostly with NDFs
and will save the conversion each time you access the dataset.

The {\tt convert} command, which sets up definitions for the {\footnotesize
CONVERT} package defines the lists of input and output formats as
follows.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setenv NDF_FORMATS_IN \
     'FITS(.fit),FIGARO(.dst),IRAF(.imh),STREAM(.das),UNFORMATTED(.unf),UNF0(.dat),
     ASCII(.asc),TEXT(.txt),GIF(.gif),TIFF(.tif),GASP(.hdr),COMPRESSED(.sdf.Z),
     GZIP(.sdf.gz),FITS(.fits),FITS(.fts),FITS(.FTS),FITS(.FITS),FITS(.FIT),
     FITS(.lilo),FITS(.lihi),FITS(.silo),FITS(.sihi),FITS(.mxlo),FITS(.rilo),
     FITS(.rihi),FITS(.vdlo),FITS(.vdhi),STREAM(.str)'

     % setenv NDF_FORMATS_OUT \
     '.,FITS(.fit),FIGARO(.dst),IRAF(.imh),STREAM(.das),UNFORMATTED(.unf),
     UNF0(.dat),ASCII(.asc),TEXT(.txt),GIF(.gif),TIFF(.tif),GASP(.hdr),
     COMPRESSED(.sdf.Z),GZIP(.sdf.gz)'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

See the {\footnotesize CONVERT} documentation for more details of these conversions.

\subsection{Other Routes for Data Import}

You can run {\footnotesize CONVERT} ({\it{cf.}}~SUN/55) directly to perform
conversions.  There is also \htmlref{TRANDAT}{TRANDAT}, which will read a text file of
data values, or co-ordinates and data values into an NDF, and 
\xref{ASCIN}{sun140}{ASCIN} in the \Figaroref\ package\latexonly{ (SUN/140)}.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_fitsreaders}FITS readers\label{se:fitsreaders}}

The automatic conversion does not allow you the full control of the
conversion that direct use of a \FITSref\ reader offers and it does
not deal with the special properties of tape.
\htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN} will read, amongst others, simple FITS files
including blocked or group format and floating-point data from tape.
\htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN} is its counterpart for disc files.  
\latexonly{Let's see the FITS readers in action.}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_readfitstape}Reading FITS Tapes\label{se:readfitstape}}

\htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN} reads FITS files stored on tape.  For
efficiency, you should select the ``no-rewind'' device for the
particular tape drive, for example {\tt /dev/nrmt0h} on OSF/1 and
{\tt /dev/rmt/1n} on Solaris.

We ask for the second file on the tape, and the headers are displayed
so we can decide whether this is the file we want.  It is so we supply
a name of an NDF to receive the FITS file.  If it wasn't we would
enter {\tt !} to the OUT prompt.  The FMTCNV parameter asks whether
the data are to be converted to \htmlref{\_REAL}{ap:HDStypes}, using
the FITS keywords BSCALE and BZERO, if present.  If you are wondering
why there is {\tt (1)} after the file number, that's present because
FITS files can have sub-files, stored as FITS extensions.

We can trace the structure to reveal the 2-byte integer CCD image.  Notice

If you have many FITS files to read there is a quick method for
extracting all files or a selection.  In automatic mode the output
files are generated without manual intervention and the headers aren't
reported for efficiency.  Should you want to see the headers, write
them to a text file via the LOGFILE parameter.  The cost of automation
is a restriction on the names of the output files, but if you have
over a hundred files on a tape are you really going to name them
individually?

The following example extracts the fourth to sixth, and eighth files.
Note that the {\tt [~]} are needed because the value for parameter FILES is
a character array. 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitsin auto

\normalsize

You can list selected FITS headers from a FITS tape without attempting
to read in the data into NDFs by using \htmlref{FITSHEAD}{FITSHEAD}.
You can redirect its output to a file to browse at your leisure, and
identify the files you want to convert.  So for instance,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitshead /dev/nrmt1h > headers.lis
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
lists all the FITS headers from a FITS tape on device {\tt /dev/nrmt1h}
to file {\tt headers.lis}.

After running FITSIN you may notice a file {\tt USRDEVDATASET.sdf} in
the current directory.  This \HDSref\ file records the current
position of the tape, so you can use FITSIN to read a few files, and
then run it again a little later, and FITSIN can carry on from where
you left off.  In other words FITSIN does not have to rewind to the
beginning of the tape to count files.  When you're finished you should
delete this file.

\subsubsection{Reading FITS Files}

For many years there was officially no such thing as
disc FITS.  However, {\it ad hoc}\ implementations have
existed for a long time.  Of these, \htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN} will handle files
adhering to the FITS rules for blocking (and more), but it doesn't
process byte-swapped `FITS' files.  Thus it can process files with
fixed-length records of semi-arbitrary length; so, for example, files
mangled during network transfer, which have 512-byte records rather
than the customary 2880, may be read.  However, it will not handle,
VAX FITS files as may be produced with \xref{{\footnotesize FIGARO's}
WDFITS}{sun86}{WDFITS}.  FITSDIN will accept a list of files with
wildcards.  However, a comma-separated list must be enclosed in
quotation marks.  Also wildcards must be protected.  Here are some
examples so you get the idea.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitsdin '*.fit'
     % fitsdin \*.fit
     ICL> fitsdin *.fit
     % fitsdin '"i*.fit,abc123.fts"'
     ICL> fitsdin "i*.fit,abc123.fts"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

In the following example a floating-point file is read (BITPIX=$-$32)
and so FMTCNV is not required.
\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitsdin '*.fits'

Both FITSIN and FITSDIN write the FITS headers into an NDF extension
called FITS within your NDF.  The extension is a literal copy of all
the 80-character `card images' in order.  These can be inspected or
written to a file via the command FITSLIST.  There is more on this NDF
extension and its purpose in
\latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:fitsairlock}.}{the \htmlref{FITS
Airlock}{se:fitsairlock}.}

\subsection{\xlabel{se_fitsairlock}The FITS Airlock\label{se:fitsairlock}}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_ndfext}NDF Extensions\label{se:ndfext}}

An important feature of the \NDFref{NDF} is that it is designed to be
extensible.  The NDF has components whose meanings are well defined
and universal, and so they can be accessed by general-purpose
software, such as {\footnotesize KAPPA} and \CONVERTref\ provide; but the
NDF also allows independent {\em extensions\/} to be defined and
added, which can store auxiliary information to suit the needs of a
specialised software package.  (Note that the term extension here
refers to a structure within the NDF for storing additional data, and
is neither the file extension {\tt .sdf} nor extensions like BINTABLE
within the FITS file.) An extension is only processed by software that
understands the meanings obeys the processing rules of the various
components of the extension. Other programmes propagate the extension
information unaltered.

The existence of extensions makes it straightforward to write general
utilities for converting an arbitrary format into an NDF.  The idea
being that every specialist package should not have to have its own
conversion tools such as a FITS reader.  However, this still leaves the
additional data that requires specialist knowledge to move it into the
appropriate extension components.  The aim is to make the conversions
themselves extensible, with add-on operations to move the specialist
information to and from the extensions.  This is where the FITS
`airlock' comes in.

The \FITSref\ data format comprises a header followed by the data
array or table.  The header contains a series of 80-character lines
each of which contains the keyword name, a value and an optional
comment. There are also some special keywords for commentary.  The
meanings of most keywords are undefined, and so can be used to
transport arbitrary ancillary information, subject to FITS syntax
limitations.  There is a special NDF extension called FITS, which
mirrors this functionality, and may be added to an NDF.  It therefore
can act as an airlock between the general-purpose conversion tools and
specialist packages.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_fitsimpexp}Importing and Exporting from and
to the FITS Extension\label{se:fitsimpexp}}

The FITS extension comprises a 1-dimensional array of 80-character
strings that follow FITS-header formatting rules.  In the case of
\htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN} and \htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN}, each FITS
extension is a verbatim copy of the FITS header of the input file.
Other conversion tools like \xref{IRAF2NDF}{sun55}{IRAF2NDF} and
\xref{UNF2NDF}{sun55}{UNF2NDF} of \CONVERTref\ can also create a FITS
extension in the same fashion.  On export, standard conversion tools
propagate the FITS extension to any FITS headers or equivalent in the
foreign format.  However, information which is derivable from the
standard NDF components, such as the array dimensions, data units, and
linear axes, replaces any equivalent headers from FITS extension.

You use your knowledge, or the writer of the specialist package
provides import tools, to recognise certain FITS keywords and to
attribute meaning to them, and then to move or process their values
to make the specialist extensions.  One such is the PREPARE task in
\IRASref\@.  Similarly, the reverse operation---exporting the
extension information---can occur too, prior to converting the NDF
into another data format.

{\footnotesize KAPPA} offers two simple tools for the importing and exporting
of extension information: \htmlref{FITSIMP}{FITSIMP} and
\htmlref{FITSEXP}{FITSEXP}.  They both use a text file which acts as a
translation table between the FITS keyword and extension components.
Starting with FITSIMP, its translation table might look like this.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ORDER_NUMBER _INTEGER  ORDNUM 
     PLATE_SCALE  _REAL SCALE         ! The plate scale in arcsec/mm
     SMOOTHED  _LOGICAL FILTERED 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

It consists of three fields: the first is the name of the component in
the chosen extension, the second is the \htmlref{HDS data type}{ap:HDStypes}
of that component, and the third is the FITS keyword.  Optional
comments can appear following an exclamation mark. So if we placed
these lines in file {\tt imptable}, we could create an extension
called MYEXT of data type MJC\_EXT (if it did not already exist)
containing components ORDER\_NUMBER, PLATE\_SCALE, and SMOOTHED.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitsimp mydata imptable myext mjc_ext
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Should any of the keywords not exist in the FITS extension, you'll be
warned.  If the extension already exists, you don't need to specify
the extension data type.  FITSIMP will even handle hierarchical
keywords and those much-loved ING packets from La Palma.

Going in the opposite direction, the text translation file could look
like this
\small
\begin{verbatim}
     MYEXT.ORDER_NUMBER  ORDNUM(LAST) The spectral order number
     MYEXT.PLATE_SCALE   SCALE   The plate scale in arcsec/mm
     MYEXT.SMOOTHED  FILTERED 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
where the first column is the `name' of the extension component to be
copied to the FITS extension.  The `name' includes the extension name
and substructures.  The second column gives the FITS keyword to which
to write the value.  A further keyword in parentheses instructs FITSEXP
to place the new FITS header immediately before the header with that
keyword.  If the second keyword is absent from the translation-table
record or the FITS extension, the new header appears immediately before
the END header line in the FITS extension.  Thus the value of ORDER\_NUMBER
in extension MYEXT, creates a new keyword in the FITS extension called
ORDNUM, and it is located immediately prior the keyword LAST.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_list-fitsext}Listing the FITS Extension and
keywords\label{se:list-fitsext}}

If you don't want to be bothered with \NDFref{NDF} extensions, you
might just want to know the value of some FITS keyword, say the
exposure time, as part of your data processing. 
\htmlref{FITSLIST}{FITSLIST} lists the contents of the FITS extension
of an NDF or file.  You can even search for keywords with {\bf grep}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitslist myndf | grep "ELAPSED ="
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This would find the keyword ELAPSED in the FITS extension of NDF
myndf.  (Keywords are 8 characters long and those with values are
immediately followed by an equals sign.)  However, the recommended
way is to use the \htmlref{FITSVAL}{FITSVAL} command.  Since this
command only reports the value, it is particularly useful in scripts
that need ancillary-data values during processing.  The following
obtains the value of keyword ELAPSED.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitsval myndf ELAPSED
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

In a script you may need to know whether the keyword exists and take
appropriate action.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     filterpre = `fitsexist myndf filter`
     if ( $filterpre == "TRUE" ) then
        filter = `fitsval myndf filter`
     else
        prompt -n "Filter > "
        set filter = $<
     endif
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Shell variable {\tt filterpres} would be assigned {\tt "TRUE"} when
the FILTER card is present, and {\tt "FALSE"} otherwise.  (The
{\tt `~`} quotes cause the enclosed command to be executed.)  So the
user of the script would be prompted for a filter name whenever the
NDF did not contain that information.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_manip-fitsext}Creating and Editing
the FITS Extension\label{se:manip-fitsext}}

Besides the conversion utilities, you can import your own FITS
extension using \htmlref{FITSTEXT}{FITSTEXT}.  You first prepare a
FITS-like header in a text file.  For example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitstext myndf myfile
\end{verbatim}

\normalsize
places the contents of {\tt myfile} in the NDF called myndf. This is
not advised unless you are familiar with the rules for writing FITS
headers.  See the NOST {\sl A User's Guide to FITS}.  You find this
and other useful FITS documents, test files, and software at 
\htmladdnormallink{FITS Support Office Home
Page} {http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/fits/fits\_home.html}\latexonly{ (URL
{\tt http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/fits/fits\_home.html})}.  FITSTEXT does
perform some limited validation of the FITS headers, and informs you
of any problems it detects.  See the \htmlref{FITSHEAD}{FITSHEAD} Notes in
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:full}}{\htmlref{application
specifications}{ap:full}} for details.

A safer bet for a hand-crafted FITS extension is to edit an existing
FITS extension to change a value, or use existing lines as templates
for any new keywords you wish to add.  \htmlref{FITSEDIT}{FITSEDIT}
lets you do this with your favourite text editor.  Define the
environment variable EDITOR to your editor, say

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setenv EDITOR jed
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
to choose {\bf jed}.  If you don't do this, and EDITOR is unassigned,
FITSEDIT selects the {\bf vi} editor.  Then to edit the NDF extension
is simple.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitsedit myndf
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This edits the FITS extension of the NDF called myndf.
FITSEDIT extracts the file into a temporary file ({\tt{zzfitsedit.tmp}})
which you edit, and then uses FITSTEXT to restore the FITS extension.
It therefore has the same parsing of the edited FITS headers as FITSTEXT
provides.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{se_emanip-fitsext}Easy way to create and edit
the FITS Extension\label{se:emanip-fitsext}}

Should you wish to write a new value without knowing about FITS, or
in a script where manual editing is undesirable, the
\htmlref{FITSWRITE}{FITSWRITE} command does the job.  So for example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitswrite myndf filter value=K
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
will create a keyword FILTER with value {\tt K} in the FITS extension
of the NDF called myndf.  If the extension does not exist, this
command will first create it.

The \htmlref{FITSMOD}{FITSMOD} command has several editing options
including the ability to delete a keyword:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitsmod myndf airmass edit=delete
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
here it removes the AIRMASS header; or rename a keyword:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitsmod myndf band rename newkey=filter
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
as in this example, where keyword BAND becomes keyword FILTER; or
update an existing keyword:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitsmod myndf filter edit=u value=\$V comment='"Standard filter name"'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
this example modifies the comment string associated with the FILTER
keyword, leaving the value unchanged.

For routine operations requiring many operations on a dataset, FITSMOD
lets you specify the editing instructions in a text file.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{se_procedures}Procedures\label{se:procedures}}

Applications from {\footnotesize KAPPA} and other packages can be
combined in procedures and scripts to customise and automate data
processing. In addition to giving literal values to application
parameters, you can include \ICLref\ or C-shell variables on the
command line, whose values are substituted at run time.  It is also
possible to write parameter data into variables, and hence pass them
to another application, or use the variables to control subsequent
processing.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_cshscript}C-shell scripts\label{se:cshscript}}

The \xref{{\sl C-shell Cookbook}}{sc4}{} contains many ingredients and
recipes, and features many {\footnotesize KAPPA} commands.  So there is little
point repeating them here other than to direct you to a documented
script in {\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/multiplot.csh}.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_ICLproc}ICL Procedures\label{se:ICLproc}}

You should consult the \xref{{\sl ICL Users' Guide}}{sg5}{} for details
about writing {\footnotesize ICL} syntax, procedures, and functions, but you're a busy
researcher\ldots  For a quick overview the {\em two-page\/} summary on
``Writing ICL command files and procedures'' in SUN/101 is recommended
reading, even though much of the document is dated and still refers
to VMS.  Here we'll just show some example procedures that can be
adapted and cover points not mentioned in SUN/101.

Let's start with something simple.  You want to `flash' a series of
images, each with a yellow border.  First you write the following
procedure called FLASH.  It has one argument INPIC, that passes the name of
the NDF you want to display.  When you substitute an {\footnotesize ICL}
variable for a parameter value you enclose it in parentheses.  The lines
beginning with {\tt \{ } are comments.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     PROC FLASH INPIC
     {
     { Procedure for displaying an image without scaling.
     {
        DISPLAY IN=(INPIC) MODE=FL 
     END PROC
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
To make {\footnotesize ICL} recognise your procedure you must `load' it.  The
command

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> LOAD FLASH
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
will load the file {\tt FLASH.ICL}.
Thereafter in the {\footnotesize ICL} session you can invoke FLASH for many
NDFs. The following will display the NDFs called GORDON and FLOOD
side-by-side.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     ICL> PICGRID 2 1 
     ICL> FLASH GORDON
     ICL> PICSEL 2
     ICL> FLASH FLOOD
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
It would be tedious to have to load lots of individual procedures, but
you don't. If you have related procedures that you regularly require
they can be concatenated into a single file which you load.  Better
still is to add definitions for each of the procedures in your {\footnotesize
ICL} login file.  This is defined as the value of the ICL\_LOGIN
environment variable.  A reasonable place is in your home directory
and you'd define it like this.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setenv ICL_LOGIN $HOME/login.icl
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
However, the file doesn't have to be in your home directory, or called
{\tt login.icl}, but it's convenient to do so.  Suppose you have three
procedures: FLASH, PICGREY in file {\tt \$MY\_DIR/display\_proc.icl},
and FILTER in {\tt /home/user1/dro/improc.icl}.  In your {\tt
\$HOME/login.icl} you could add the following

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     defproc  flash     $MY_DIR/display_proc.icl
     defproc  sfilt     $HOME/user1/dro/improc.icl filter
     defproc  picgr(ey) $MY_DIR/display_proc.icl
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
which defines three commands that will be available each time you
use {\footnotesize ICL}: FLASH which will run your FLASH
procedure, PICGREY to execute the PICGREY procedure, and SFILT which
runs the FILTER procedure.  In addition PICGREY can be abbreviated
to PICGR or PICGRE.  So now you can load and run your procedure.
Let's have some more example procedures.

Suppose you have a series of commands to run on a number of files.
You could create a procedure to perform all the stages of the
processing, deleting the intermediate files that it creates.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     PROC UNSHARPMASK NDFIN CLIP NDFOUT

     { Insert ampersands to tell the command-line interpreter than these
     { strings are file names.
        IF SUBSTR( NDFIN, 1, 1 ) <> '@'
           NDFIN = '@' & (NDFIN)
        END IF
        IF SUBSTR( JUNK, 1, 1 ) <> '@'
           NDFOUT = '@' & (NDFOUT)
        END IF

     { Clip the image to remove the cores of stars and galaxies above
     { a nominated threshold.
        THRESH (NDFIN) TMP1 THRHI=(CLIP) NEWHI=(CLIP) \

     { Apply a couple of block smoothings with boxsizes of 5 and 13
     { pixels.  Delete the temporary files as we go along.
        BLOCK tmp1 tmp2 BOX=5
        ! rm tmp1.sdf
        BLOCK tmp2 tmp3 BOX=13
        ! rm tmp2.sdf

     { Multiply the smoothed image by a scalar.
        CMULT tmp3 0.8 tmp4
        ! rm tmp3.sdf

     { Subtract the smoothed and renormalised image from the input image.
     { The effect is to highlight the fine detail, but still retain some
     { of the low-frequency features.
        SUB (NDFIN) tmp4 (NDFOUT)
        ! rm tmp4.sdf
     END PROC
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
There is a piece of syntax to note which often catches people out.
Filenames, data objects, and devices passed via {\footnotesize ICL} variables
to applications, such as NDFIN and NDFOUT in the above example, must
be preceded by an {\tt @}.

A common use of procedures is likely to be to duplicate processing
for several files.  Here is an example procedure that does that.  It uses
some intrinsic functions which look just like Fortran.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     PROC MULTISTAT

     { Prompt for the number of NDFs to analyse.  Ensure that it is positive.
        INPUTI Number of frames:  (NUM)
        NUM = MAX( 1, NUM )

     { Find the number of characters required to format the number as
     { a string using a couple of ICL functions.
        NC = INT( LOG10( I ) ) + 1

     { Loop NUM times.
        LOOP FOR I=1 TO (NUM)

     { Generate the name of the NDF to be analysed via the ICL function
     { SNAME.
          FILE = '@' & SNAME('REDX',I,NC)

     { Form the statistics of the image.
          STATS NDF=(FILE)
        END LOOP
     END PROC
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
If NUM is set to 10, the above procedure obtains the statistics of the
images named REDX1, REDX2, \dots REDX10. The {\footnotesize
ICL} variable FILE is in parentheses because its value is to be
substituted into parameter NDF. 

Here is another example, which could be used to flat field a series of
CCD frames.  Instead of executing a specific number of files, you
can enter an arbitrary sequence of NDFs.  When processing is
completed a !! is entered rather than an NDF name, and that exits the
loop.  Note the {\tt \~{}} continuation character (it's not
required but it's included for pedagogical reasons).
\pagebreak[3]

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     PROC FLATFIELD

     { Obtain the name of the flat-field NDF.  If it does not have a
     { leading @ insert one.
        INPUT "Which flat field frame?: " (FF)
        IF SUBSTR( FF, 1, 1 ) <> '@'
           FF = '@' & (FF)
        END IF

     { Loop until there are no further NDFs to flat field.
        MOREDATA = TRUE
        LOOP WHILE MOREDATA

     { Obtain the frame to flat field.  Assume that it will not have
     { an @ prefix. Generate a title for the flattened frame.
           INPUT "Enter frame to flat field (!! to exit): " (IMAGE)
           MOREDATA = IMAGE <> '!!'
           IF MOREDATA
              TITLE = 'Flat field of ' & (IMAGE)
              IMAGE = '@' & (IMAGE)

     { Generate the name of the flattened NDF.
              IMAGEOUT = (IMAGE) & 'F'
              PRINT Writing to (IMAGEOUT) 

     { Divide the image by the flat field.
              DIV IN1=(IMAGE) IN2=(FF) OUT=(IMAGEOUT) ~
                TITLE=(TITLE)
           END IF
        END LOOP
     END PROC
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Some {\footnotesize KAPPA} applications, particularly the statistical ones,
produce output parameters which can be passed between applications via
{\footnotesize ICL} variables. Here is an example to draw a
contour plot centred about a star in a nominated data array
from only the star's approximate position.  The region about the star is
stored in an output NDF file.  Note the syntax required to define the
value of parameter INIT; the space between the left bracket and
parenthesis is essential.

\section{\xlabel{se_probpage}Problems Problems\label{se:probpage}}
\subsection{Errors}
A detailed list of error codes and their meanings is not available.
{\footnotesize KAPPA} produces descriptive contextual error messages, which
are usually straightforward to comprehend.  Some of these originate in
the underlying infrastructure software.  Error messages from {\footnotesize
KAPPA} begin with the name of the application reporting the error. The
routine may have detected the error, or it has something to say about
the context of the error.

The remainder of the section describes some difficulties you may encounter
and how to overcome them.  Please suggest additions to this compilation.

\subsection{Unable to Obtain Work Space}

Error messages like ``Unable to create a work array'' may puzzle you.
They are accompanied by additional error messages that usually
pinpoint the reason for the failure of the application to complete.
Many applications require temporary or work space to perform their
calculations.  This space is stored in an \HDSref\ file within directory
{\tt \$HDS\_SCRATCH} and most likely is charged to your disc quota. (If you
have not redefined this environment variable, it will point to your
current directory.) So one cause for the message is insufficient disc
quota available to store the work space container file or to extend
it.  A second reason for the message is that your computer cannot
provide sufficient virtual memory to map the workspace.  In this case
you can try increasing your process limits using the C-shell built-in
function {\tt limit}.  You can find your current limits by entering
{\tt limit}.  You should see a list something like this.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     cputime         unlimited
     filesize        unlimited
     datasize        131072 kbytes
     stacksize       2048 kbytes
     coredumpsize    unlimited
     memoryuse       89232 kbytes
     vmemoryuse      1048576 kbytes
     descriptors     4096 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The relevant keywords are {\tt datasize} and the {\tt vmemoryuse}.  In
effect {\tt datasize} specifies the maximum total size of data files
you can map at one time in a single programme.  The default should be
adequate for most purposes and only need be modified for those working
with large images or cubes.  The {\tt vmemoryuse} specifies the maximum
virtual memory you can use.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % limit datasize 32768
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
sets the maximum size of mapped data to 32 megabytes.  Values cannot
exceed the system limits.  You can list these with the {\tt -h}
qualifier.

\small
\begin{verbatim}

Although you can set your limits to the system maxima, it doesn't mean
that you should just increase your quotas to the limits. You might
become unpopular with some of your colleagues, especially if you
accidentally try to access a huge amount of memory.  If you cannot
accommodate your large datasets this way, you should fragment your
data array, and process the pieces separately.

After receiving this error message in an \ICLref\ session you may
need to delete the scratch file by hand.  The file is called {\tt
txxx.sdf}, where {\tt xxxx} is a process identifier.  A normal exit
from {\footnotesize ICL} will delete the work-space container file.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_probwrongNDF}Application Automatically Picks up the
Wrong NDF\label{se:probwrongNDF}}

Some applications read the name of the \NDFref{NDF}\ used to create a plot or
image from the graphics database in order to save typing.  Once in a
while you'll say ``that's not the one I wanted''.  This is because 
\AGIref\ finds the last {\tt DATA} picture situated within the current picture.
Abort the application via {\tt !!}, then use \htmlref{PICCUR}{PICCUR}
or \htmlref{PICLIST}{PICLIST} to select the required {\tt FRAME}
picture enclosing the {\tt DATA} picture, or even select the latter
directly.  You can override the AGI NDF also by specifying the
required NDF on the command line, provided it has pixels whose indices
lies within the world co-ordinates of the {\tt DATA} picture.  Thus

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % inspect myndf
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
will inspect the NDF called myndf.  The command \htmlref{PICIN}{PICIN} will
show the last DATA picture and its associated NDF.

\subsection{Unable to Store a Picture in the Graphics Database}
You may receive an error message, which says failed to store
such-and-such picture in the \htmlref{graphics database}{se:agitate}.
For some reason the database was corrupted due to reasons external to
{\footnotesize KAPPA}.  Don't worry, usually your plot will have appeared, and
to fix the problem run \htmlref{GDCLEAR}{GDCLEAR} 
or delete the database file
({\tt{\$AGI\_USER/agi\_}}{\it $<$node$>$}{\tt.sdf}, where you substitute your
system's node name for {\it $<$node$>$}).  You will need to redraw the
last plot if you still require it, say for interaction.

\subsection{Line Graphics are Invisible on an Graphics Device}
The reason for invisible line graphics on your graphics device is
because it is drawn in black or a dark grey.  Most likely is that some
person has been using other software on your graphics device or that is
has been reset.  \htmlref{PALDEF}{PALDEF} will set up the default
colours for the palette, and so most line graphics will then appear in
white.  Alternatively,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % palentry 1 white
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
will normally suffice.

\subsection{Error Obtaining a Locator to a Slice of an HDS array}
If the above error appears from DAT\_SLICE and you are (re)prompted
for an \NDFref{NDF}, the most likely cause is that you have asked an
\htmlref{IMAGE}{ap:IMAGE-format} application to process an
\htmlref{NDF section}{se:ndfsect}.  Use \htmlref{NDFCOPY}{NDFCOPY} to
make a subset before running the application in question, or process
the whole NDF.

\subsection{Badly placed ()'s}
This means that you have forgotten to `escape' parentheses, probably when
defining an NDF section.  Try inserting a backslash before each
parenthesis.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % stats myndf\(100:200,\)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{Attempt to use 'positional' parameter value ({\tt{x}}) in an 
unallocated position}
Check the usage of the application you are running.  One way of
adding positional parameters unintentionally, is to forget to escape
the {\tt{"}} from the shell when supplying a string with spaces or
wildcards.  For example, this error would arise if we entered

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % settitle myndf "A title"
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
instead of say

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % settitle myndf '"A title"'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
which protects all special characters between the single quotes.

\subsection{The choice {\tt x} is not in the menu.  The options
are\ldots}
You have either made an incorrect selection, or you have forgotten
to escape a metacharacter.  For the former, you can select a new
value from the list of valid values presented in the error message.
For the latter, part of another value is being
interpreted as a positional value for the parameter the task is
complaining about.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % linplot $KAPPA_DIR/spectrum style="Title=Red-giant plot"
     !! The choice plot is not in the menu.  The options are
     !     Data,Quality,Error,Variance.
     !  Invalid selection for parameter COMP.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Here it thinks that {\tt plot} is a positional value.  Escape
the {\tt{"}} to cure the problem.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % linplot $KAPPA_DIR/spectrum style='"Title=Red-giant plot"'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{\xlabel{se_fitsunixtape}``I've Got This FITS Tape''
\label{se:fitsunixtape}}

Certain combinations of magnetic tape produced on one model of tape
drive but read on a different model seem to generate parity errors
that are detected by the MAG\_ library that \htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN}
uses.  However, this doesn't mean that you won't be able to read your
FITS tape.  The UNIX tape-reading commands seem less sensitive to
these parity errors.

Thus you should first attempt to convert the inaccessible FITS files
on tape to disc files using the UNIX {\bf dd} command, and then use
the \htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN} application to generate the output NDF
or foreign format.  For example to convert a FITS file from device
{\tt /dev/nrst0} to an NDF called ndfname, you might enter

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % dd if=/dev/nrst0 ibs=2880 of=file.fits
     % fitsdin files=file.fits out=ndfname
     % rm file.fits
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
where {\tt file.fits} is the temporary disc-FITS file.  The 2880 is
the length of a FITS record in bytes.   Repeated {\bf dd} commands to
a no-rewind tape device (those with the {\tt n} prefix on OSF/1 and the
{\tt n} suffix on Solaris) will copy successive files.  To skip over
files or rewind the tape, use the {\bf mt} command.  For example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % mt -f /dev/rmt/1n fsf 3
           :       :       :
     % mt -f /dev/rmt/1n asf 4
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
moves the tape on device {\tt /dev/rmt/1n} forward three files,
then moves to the fourth file,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % mt bsf 2
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
moves back two files on the default tape drive (defined by the
environment variable TAPE), and

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % mt -f /dev/nrmt0h rewind
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
rewinds to the start of the tape on device {\tt /dev/nrmt0h}.
Thus it is possible to write a script for extracting and converting a
series of files including ranges, just like FITSIN does.  

If the above approach fails, try another tape drive.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_probfitsin}FITSIN does not Recognise my FITS Tape
\xlabel{se_probfitsin}}

If you attempt to read a FITS magnetic tape with
\htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN}, you might receive an error like this

\vspace*{-\smallskipamount}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % fitsin
     % MT - Tape deck /@/dev/nrmt1h/ > /dev/nrmt3l
     !! Object '/DEV/NRMT3L' not found.
     !  DAT_FIND: Error finding a named component in an HDS structure.
     !  /dev/nrmt3l: MAG__UNKDV, Unable to locate device in DEVDATASET
\end{verbatim}
\vspace*{-\medskipamount}
\normalsize
when you enter the device name.  The magnetic-tape system uses an
\HDSref\ file called the device dataset (DEVDATASET) to store the
position of the tape between invocations of Starlink applications.
\goodbreak

When FITSIN is given a name, the magnetic-tape system validates the
name to check that it is a known device.  There should be a
{\tt devdataset.sdf} file (within {\tt /star/etc} at Starlink sites)
containing a list of at least all the available drives at your site.
What FITSIN is complaining about above, is that the device you have
given is not included in the DEVDATASET file.  Now this might be
because you mistyped the device name, or that the particular device is
not accessible on the particular machine, or because your computer manager
has not maintained the DEVDATASET when a drive was added.  You can look
at the contents of the DEVDATASET with this command.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hdstrace /star/etc/devdataset
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize


Oh and one other point: make sure the tape is loaded in the drive.
Yes this mistake has happened (not mentioning any names) and it is
very hard to diagnose remotely.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_probweird}It Used to Work\ldots and Weird
Errors\label{se:probweird}}

There is a class of error that arises when an \HDSref\ file is corrupted.
The specific message will depend on the file concerned and where
in the file the corruption occurred.  The most likely reason for file
corruption is breaking into a task at the wrong moment, or trying
to write to a file at the same time. 

If you want to process simultaneously from different sessions---say
one interactive and another in batch---it is wise to redefine the
environment variables \$ADAM\_USER, and \$AGI\_USER if you want
graphics on the same machine. The environment variables should point
to a separate existing directory for each additional session.  This
will keep the \htmlref{global}{se:parglobals} and
\htmlref{application parameters}{se:defaults}, and the
\htmlref{graphics database}{se:agitate} separate for each session.

The way to look for corrupted HDS files is trace them.
Assuming that \$ADAM\_USER and \$AGI\_USER are defined,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hdstrace $ADAM_USER/GLOBALS full
     % hdstrace $ADAM_USER/ardmask full
     % hdstrace $AGI_USER/agi_cacvad full
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
traces the {\tt GLOBALS} file, the application you were running when the
weird error occurred (here \htmlref{ARDMASK}{ARDMASK}), and the
graphics database for machine {\tt cacvad}.  Once you have identified
the problem file, delete it.  If that proves to be the globals file,
you might want to retain the output from \HDSTRACEref , so that you can
restore their former values.  Deleting the graphics database is
something you should do regularly, so that's not a problem.

If you have been running {\footnotesize KAPPA} from \ICLref , you will need
to check of the integrity of the monolith parameter file, instead
the individual parameter file.  It will be one of these depending
on the type of task that failed: graphics, NDF components, or
the rest (mostly image processing) corresponding to these three
monolith interface files.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % hdstrace $ADAM_USER/kapview_mon full
     % hdstrace $ADAM_USER/ndfpack_mon full
     % hdstrace $ADAM_USER/kappa_mon full
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize


If that doesn't cure the problem, send the Starlink Software Librarian 
{\tt ussc@star.rl.ac.uk} a log of
the session demonstrating the problem, and we shall endeavour to
interpret it for you, and find out what's going wrong.

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{se_custom}Custom KAPPA\label{se:custom}}

\subsection{\xlabel{se_custom}Tasks\label{se:customtasks}}

{\footnotesize KAPPA} applications can be modified to suit your particular
requirements.  Since this document is not a programmer's guide,
instructions are not given here.  Programmers should contact the
author for details until a new Programmer's Guide appears to replace
the old \xref{SUN/101}{sun101}{}, which {\em was\/} a good summary of
Starlink infrastructure libraries and programming.

All the source files can be found in {\tt /star/kappa/*.tar} on
Starlink machines.  The {\tt /star} path may be different outside of
Starlink, so check with your computer manager.  There is a separate
tar file for each {\footnotesize KAPPA} subroutine library (with a {\tt
\_sub} suffix) and the interface files, with obvious names.  The
remaining files: the monolith routines, link scripts, include files,
the help source, shell scripts, {\footnotesize ICL} procedures, and test data
are in {\tt kappa\_source.tar}.  There is also a Starlink standard
{\tt makefile} and {\tt mk} script.

Many of the general purpose subroutines which previously formed part of
{\footnotesize KAPPA} have now been moved into a separate software item
called {\footnotesize KAPLIBS} (see \xref{SUN/238}{sun238}{}).
{\footnotesize KAPPA} itself now links against the libraries
in {\footnotesize KAPLIBS}.

Here is a worked example.  Suppose that you have
\htmlref{\_REAL}{ap:HDStypes}-type datasets for which you want to
compute statistics including the skewness and kurtosis.  One way is to
modify STATS.  First to save typing define environment variables, say
STAR and KAPPA and KAPLIBS to point to where the Starlink software,
{\footnotesize KAPPA} and {\footnotesize KAPLIBS} source is stored.  Next
we extract the source files to change.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setenv STAR /star
     % setenv KAPPA /star/sources/kappa
     % setenv KAPLIBS /star/sources/kaplibs
     % tar xf $KAPPA/kappa_sub.tar stats.
     % tar xf $KAPPA/kappa_ifls.tar stats.ifl
     % tar xf $KAPLIBS/kapgen_sub.tar kpg1_statr.f
     % tar xf $KAPLIBS/kapgen_sub.tar kpg1_stdsr.f
     % tar xf $KAPPA/kappa_source.tar kappa_link_adam
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

We modify {\tt kpg1\_statr.f} to compute the additional statistics;
{\tt kpg1\_stdsr.f} to list the statistics; {\tt stats.f} to update the
documentation, to use the revised argument lists of the subroutines,
and to output the new statistics to parameters; and {\tt stats.ifl}
to add the output parameters.  {\tt kappa\_link\_adam} need not be
modified, but it is needed during linking.

Next some soft links to include files need to be made.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % star_dev
     % ndf_dev
     % prm_dev
     % par_dev
     % kaplibs_dev
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
For some other application and subroutines, you can find what is
needed by trying to compile them and see which include files the
compiler cannot locate.  You then invoke the appropriate package
definitions: {\em pkg}{\tt \_dev}, where {\em pkg\/} is the three-letter
package abbreviation.  Now compile the modified code.  This is for
OSF/1:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % f77 -O -c -nowarn stats.f kpg1_statr.f kpg1_stdsr.f
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and this is for Solaris:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % f77 -O -PIC -c -w stats.f kpg1_statr.f kpg1_stdsr.f
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The {\tt -nowarn} and {\tt -w} prevent warning messages appearing.

And this is for Linux:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % g77 -fno-second-underscore -O -c stats.f kpg1_statr.f kpg1_stdsr.f
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Now link the task to produce a new {\tt stats} executable.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % alink stats.o -o stats kpg1_statr.o kpg1_stdsr.o \
     -L$STAR/lib `./kappa_link_adam`
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

If you want to use {\footnotesize KAPPA} subroutines for your own application
here are words of warning: {\em the code may undergo alterations of
subroutine name or argument lists, and those without a {\em pkg\_\/}
prefix will either be replaced or renamed.} Therefore, you should copy
the modules you need.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_custom}Parameters\label{se:custompar}}

If you don't like {\footnotesize KAPPA}'s parameter defaults, or its choice
of which parameters get prompted for and which get defaulted, then you
can change them.  Extract the interface file from \linebreak
{\tt /star/kappa/kappa\_ifls.tar} to your work directory and make the
required modifications, and then recompile it.  See
\xref{SUN/115}{sun115}{} on the meanings and possible values of the
fieldnames, and how to recompile the interface file.  If you use
\ICLref , you'll need to modify a monolith interface file: {\tt
\$KAPPA\_DIR/kappa\_mon.ifl}, {\tt kapview\_mon.ifl} or {\tt
ndfpack\_mon.ifl}.  Finally, you will need to specify a search path
that includes the directory containing your modified interface file.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % setenv ADAM_IFL /home/scratch/dro/ifls:/usr/local/kappa
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This asks Starlink programmes to look in {\tt /home/scratch/dro/ifls}
to find the interface file, and if there isn't one to look in {\tt
/usr/local/kappa}.  If the interface file search is unsuccessful, the
directory containing the executable is assumed.  Thus if you've not
created your own interface file for a task, you'll get the released
version.  Of course, once you have done this, the documentation in
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:full}}{the \htmlref{application
specifications}{ap:full}} will no longer be correct.

\subsection{\xlabel{se_custom}Commands\label{se:customcom}}

There is an easier method of tailoring {\footnotesize KAPPA} to your
requirements.  If you frequently use certain commands, especially
those with a long list of keywords and fixed values, you can define
some C-shell aliases or \ICLref\ symbols for the commands.  Like
the shell's {\tt \$HOME/.login}, {\footnotesize ICL} has a {\em login file}.
(See \xref{``ICL for Unix'' Appendix in SUN/144}{sun144}{icl_for_unix}, or 
\xref{SSN/64}{ssn64}{} for details.)  If you add symbols to this file,
each time you activate {\footnotesize ICL} these abbreviations will be
available to you without further typing.  What you should do is to
create a {\tt login.icl} in a convenient directory, and assign the
environment variable ICL\_LOGIN to that directory in your {\tt
\$HOME/.login} file.

It is possible to have several {\footnotesize ICL} login files, each for
different work in different directories.  Now to abbreviate a command
you put a DEFSTRING entry into the {\footnotesize ICL} login file.  For
example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     DEFSTRING MYC{ON} CONTOUR CLEAR=F PENROT MODE=AU NCONT=7
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

defines {\tt MYC} or {\tt MYCO} or {\tt MYCON} to run
\htmlref{CONTOUR}{CONTOUR} without clearing the screen, with pen
rotation and seven equally spaced contour heights.  The symbols are not
limited to {\footnotesize KAPPA}.  Indeed they can include shorthands for
shell commands.  For example,

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     DEFSTRING DA ls -al 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
would make DA produce a directory listing of all files with sizes and
modification dates.

You can check what the current login files are as follows.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % printenv | grep ICL_LOGIN
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

For shell usage similar definitions can be made with aliases. For
example, 
 
\small
\begin{verbatim}
     % alias mycon contour clear=f penrot mode=au ncont=7
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
 
is the equivalent of the DEFSTRING above, except that in keeping with
UNIX tradition the command is in lowercase, and the alias cannot be
abbreviated.

\section{Acknowledgements}

Several people have contributed complete {\footnotesize KAPPA}
programmes, or have upgraded earlier versions, or have written original
code (which eventually became included in {\footnotesize KAPPA} after
reworking). Mark Taylor and Rodney Warren-Smith both re-wrote some of the old 
IMAGE applications to use the NDF\_ library. Rodney also supplied several other
programmes, especially ones that now form the basis of NDFPACK. Other

\section{\xlabel{ap_quotas}Quotas to run KAPPA\label{ap:quotas}}

No special quotas are needed to run {\footnotesize KAPPA}.  If you have large
datasets you might need to increase the datasize limit in the C-shell.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    % limit datasize 65336
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

current values use the {\bf limit} command without any arguments.

\section{\xlabel{ap_full}Specifications of KAPPA applications\label{ap:full}}
\subsection{Explanatory Notes}

The specification of parameters has the following format. 

\begin{verbatim}
     name  =  type (access)
        description
\end{verbatim}
This format also includes a {\em Usage\/} entry.  \label{ap:usage}
This shows how the application is invoked from the command line.  It
lists the positional parameters in order followed by any prompted
keyword parameters using a \mbox{``KEYWORD=?''} syntax.  Defaulted
keyword parameters do not appear.  Positional parameters that are
normally defaulted are indicated by being enclosed in square brackets.
Keyword ({\it{i.e.}}\ not positional) parameters are needed where the
number of parameters are large, and usually occur because they depend
on the value of another parameter.  These are denoted by a curly
brace; the parameters on each line are related, and each line is
mutually exclusive.  An example should clarify.
\bigskip

{\ssttt \hspace*{1.0em}
        contour ndf [comp] mode ncont [key] [device] 
        \newline\hspace*{2.5em}
        $\left\{ {\begin{tabular}{l}
                    FIRSTCNT=? STEPCNT=? \\
                    HEIGHTS=?
                   \end{tabular} }
        \right.$
        \newline\hspace*{2.9em}
        \makebox[0mm][c]{\footnotesize mode}
}
\bigskip

NDF, COMP, MODE, NCONT, KEY, DEVICE, and SMOOTHING are all positional
parameters.  Only NDF, MODE, and NCONT would be prompted if not given
on the command line.  The remaining parameters depend on the value of
MODE.  If the mode is to nominate a list of contour heights, HEIGHTS
will be needed (MODE~=~{\tt "Free"}); alternatively, if the mode requires a
start height and spacing between contours FIRSTCNT and STEPCNT should be
specified (MODE~=~{\tt "Linear"} or {\tt "Magnitude"}).  Note that there
are other modes which do not require additional information, and hence no
more parameters. 

There is also an {\em Examples\/} section. \label{ap:example}  This
shows how to run the application from the command line.  More often
you'll enter the command name and just some of the parameters, and be
prompted for the rest. {\em Note that from the C-shell you must escape
any special characters that appear in these examples.} For instance,
the fourth example of COMPAVE would be written like this

\begin{verbatim}
     compave cosmos galaxy '[4,3]' weight title='"COSMOS compressed"'
\end{verbatim}

from the C-shell.

\medskip

Some parameters will only be used when another parameter has a certain
value or mode. These are indicated by the name of the mode in
parentheses at the end of the parameter description, but before any
default, {\it{e.g.}}\ parameter DEVICE in \htmlref{CENTROID}{CENTROID}
is only relevant when parameter MODE is {\tt "Cursor"}.

{\tt \%name} means the value of parameter {\it name}.

The description entry has a notation scheme to indicate 
normally defaulted parameters, {\it{i.e.}}\ those for which there will
be no prompt.
For such parameters a matching pair of square brackets ({\tt{[]}})
terminates the description.  The content between the brackets mean
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt{[]}}]
Empty brackets means that the default is created dynamically
by the application, and may depend on the values of other parameters.
Therefore, the default cannot be given explicitly.
\item[{\tt [,]}]
As above, but there are two default values that are created dynamically.
\item[{\tt [}{\rm default}{\tt{]}}]
Occasionally, a description of the default is given in normal type,
{\it{e.g.}}\ the size of the plotting region in a graphics application,
where the exact default values depend on the device chosen. 
\item[{\tt [default]}]
If the brackets contain a value in teletype-fount, this is the explicit
default value.

   Integrates pixel values within an aperture of an NDF
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine displays statistics for pixels that lie within a
      specified aperture of an NDF. The aperture can either be circular
      (specified by parameters CENTRE and DIAM), or arbitrary (specified
      by parameter ARDFILE). If the aperture is specified using parameters
      CENTRE and DIAM, then it must be either 1 or 2 dimensional.

      The following statistics are displayed:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         The total number of pixels within the aperture

         \sstitem
         The number of good pixels within the aperture

         \sstitem

         The standard deviation of the pixel values within the aperture

      }
      If individual pixel variances are not available within the input NDF
      (\emph{i.e.} if it has no VARIANCE component), then each pixel is assumed to
      have a constant variance equal to the variance of the pixel values
      within the aperture. There is an option to weight pixels so that
      pixels with larger variances are given less weight (see parameter
      WEIGHT). The statistics are displayed on the screen and written to
      output parameters. They may also be written to a log file.

      A pixel is included if its centre is within the aperture, and is not
      included otherwise. This simple approach may not be suitable for
      accurate aperture photometry, especially where the aperture diameter
      is less than about ten times the pixel size. A specialist photometry
      package should be used if accuracy, rather than speed, is paramount.

      This is an interactive tool for selecting regions of a displayed
      image using a cursor, and then storing a description of the
      selected regions in a text file in the form of an `ARD
      Description{\tt '} (see SUN/183).  This text file may subsequently be
      used in conjunction with packages such as CCDPACK or ESP.

      The application initially obtains a value for the SHAPE parameter
      and then allows you to identify either one or many regions of the
      specified shape, dependent on the value of parameter STARTUP.
      When the required regions have been identified, a value is
      obtained for parameter OPTION, and that value determines what
      happens next.  Options include obtaining further regions,
      changing the current region shape, listing the currently defined
      regions, leaving the application, \emph{etc}.  Once the selected action
      has been performed, another value is obtained for OPTION, and
      this continues until you choose to leave the application.

      Instructions on the use of the cursor are displayed when the
      application is run.  The points required to define a region of
      the requested shape are described whenever the current region
      shape is changed using parameter SHAPE.  Once the points required
      to define a region have been given an outline of the entire
      region is drawn on the graphics device using the pen specified by
      parameter PALNUM.

      In the absence of any other information, subsequent application
      will use the union (\emph{i.e.} the logical OR) of all the defined
      regions.  However, regions can be combined in other ways using the
      COMBINE option (see parameter OPTION).  For instance, two regions
      originally defined using the cursor could be replaced by their
      region of intersection (logical AND), or a single region could be
      replaced by its own exterior (logical NOT).  Other operators can
      also be used (see parameter OPERATOR).

         By default, a null ({\tt !}) value is used for WLIM, which causes

   Calculates polarisation parameters
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine calculates various parameters describing the
      polarisation described by four intensity arrays analysed at 0\dgs,
      45\dgs, 90\dgs, and 135\dgs\ to a reference direction.  Variance
      values are
      stored in the output NDFs if all the input NDFs have variances and
      you give a true value for parameter VARIANCE.

      By default, three output NDFs are created holding percentage
      polarisation, polarisation angle and total intensity. However,
      NDFs holding other quantities, such as the Stokes parameters, can
      also be produced by over-riding the default null values
      associated with the corresponding parameters.  The creation of any
      output NDF can be suppressed by supplying a null value for the
      corresponding parameter.

      There is an option to correct the calculated values of percentage
      polarisation and polarised intensity to take account of the
      statistical bias introduced by the asymmetric distribution of
      percentage polarisation (see parameter DEBIAS).  This correction
      subtracts the variance of the percentage polarisation from the
      squared percentage polarisation, and uses the square root of this
      as the corrected percentage polarisation.  The corresponding
      polarised intensity is then found by multiplying the corrected
      percentage polarisation by the total intensity.  Returned variance
      values take no account of this correction.

      Estimation of Centroid Positions
   }{
      Each centroid position is obtained by projecting the data values
      within a search box centred on the supplied position, on to each
      axis in turn. This forms a set of profiles for the feature, one for
      each axis. An estimate of the background at each point in these
      profiles is made and subtracted from the profile. This flattens the
      profile backgrounds, removing any slope in the data. Once the
      profiles have been flattened in this way, and estimate of the
      background noise in each is made. The centroid of the feature is
      then found using only the data above the noise level.

      Successive estimates of the centroid position are made by using the
      previous estimate of the centroid as the initial position for
      another estimation. This loop is repeated up to a maximum number of
      iterations, though it normally terminates when a desired accuracy
      has been achieved.

      The achieved accuracy is affected by noise, and the presence of
      non-Gaussian or overlapping features, but typically an accuracy
      better than 0.1 pixel is readily attainable for stars. The error in
      the centroid position may be estimated by a Monte-Carlo method
      using the data variance to generate realisations of the data about
      the feature (see parameter CERROR).  Each realisation is processed
      identically to the actual data, and statistics are formed to derive
      the standard deviations.

   COLCOMP
}{
   Produces a colour composite of up to three 2-dimensional NDFs
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application combines up to three 2-dimensional NDFs, using a
      different primary colour (red, green or blue) to represent each NDF.
      The resulting colour composite image is available in two forms; as an
      NDF with an associated colour table (see parameters OUT and LUT), and
      as an ASCII PPM image file (see parameter PPM). The full pixel
      resolution of the input NDFs is retained. Note, this application
      does not actually display the image, it just creates various output
      files which must be displayed using other tools (see below).

      The data values in each of the input NDFs which are to be mapped onto
      zero intensity and full intensity can be given manually using
      parameters RLOW, RHIGH, GLOW, GHIGH, BLOW and BHIGH, but by default
      they are evaluated automatically. This is done by finding specified
      percentile points within the data histograms of each of the input
      images (see parameter PERCENTILES).

      The NDF outputs are intended to be displayed with KAPPA application
      DISPLAY, using the command:

      \hspace{5mm} {\small {\tt display $<$out$>$ scale=no lut=$<$lut$>$} }

      where ``{\tt $<$out$>$}'' and ``{\tt $<$lut$>$}'' are the names of the
      NDF image and colour table created by this application using
      parameters OUT and LUT. The main advantage of this NDF form of
      output over the PPM form is that any WCS or AXIS information in the
      input NDFs is still available, and can be used to create axis
      annotations by the DISPLAY command. The graphics device which will
      be used to display the image must be specified when running this
      application (see parameter DEVICE).

      The PPM form of output can be displayed using tools such as {\tt "}xv{\tt "}, or
      converted into other forms (GIF or JPEG, for instance) using tools
      such as {\tt "}ppmtogif{\tt "} and {\tt "}cjpeg{\tt "} from the NetPbm or PbmPlus packages.
      These tools provide more sophisticated colour quantisation methods
      than are used by this application when creating the NDF outputs, and
      so may give better visual results.

         relatively few good pixels to contribute to the smoothed

      with the colour of the nearest limit. A key showing the
      relationship between colour and data value can be displayed (see
      parameter KEY).

      Annotated axes or a simple border can be drawn around the image (see
      parameters AXES and BORDER). The appearance of these may be controlled
      in detail (see parameters STYLE and BORSTYLE).

      A specified colour lookup table may optionally be loaded prior to
      displaying the image (see parameter LUT). For devices which reset
      the colour table when opened (such as postscript files), this may
      be the only way of controlling the colour table.

         A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
         string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text file
         preceded by an up-arrow character {\tt "}$\wedge${\tt "}. Such text files should
         contain further comma-separated lists which will be read and
         interpreted in the same manner. Attribute settings are applied in
         the order in which they occur within the list, with later settings
         over-riding any earlier settings given for the same attribute.

         Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:

            $<$name$>$=$<$value$>$

         where $<$name$>$ is the name of a plotting attribute, and $<$value$>$ is
         the value to assign to the attribute. Default values will be
         used for any unspecified attributes. All attributes will be
         defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied. See section {\tt "}Plotting
         Attributes{\tt "} in SUN/95 for a description of the available
         attributes. Any unrecognised attributes are ignored (no error is
         reported).

         Axis 1 is always the {\tt "}data value{\tt "} axis. So for instance, to set
         the label for the data value axis, assign a value to {\tt "}Label(1){\tt "}
         in the supplied style.

         To get a ramp key (the default), specify {\tt "}form=ramp{\tt "}. To
         get a histogram key (a coloured histogram of pen indices),
         specify {\tt "}form=histogram{\tt "}. To get a graph key (three curves of
         RGB intensities), specify {\tt "}form=graph{\tt "}. If a histogram key
         is produced, the population axis can be either logarithmic or
         linear. To get a logarithmic population axis, specify {\tt "}logpop=1{\tt "}.
         To get a linear population axis, specify {\tt "}logpop=0{\tt "} (the default).
         To annotate the long axis with pen numbers instead of pixel value,
         specify {\tt "}pennums=1{\tt "} (the default, {\tt "}pennums=0{\tt "}, shows pixel

         controlling the appearance of the image on certain devices,
         such as colour printers, that do not have a dynamic colour
         table (i.e. the colour table is reset when the device is

         the new colour table remains after this application has

         be used.

         being 3, and the second being arbitrary.  The method used to
         compress or expand the colour table if the second dimension is
         different from the number of unreserved colour indices is

   Draws $+$/-n standard-deviation lines on a line plot
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine draws straight lines on an existing plot stored in
      the graphics database, such as produced by LINPLOT or HISTOGRAM.
      The lines are located at arbitrary multiples of the standard
      deviation (NSIGMA) either side of the mean of a given dataset.
      The default dataset is the one used to draw the existing plot.
      You can plot the lines horizontally or vertically as appropriate.
      The lines extend the full width or height of the plot{\tt '}s data
      area.  Up to five different multiples of the standard deviation
      may be presented in this fashion. Each line can be drawn with a
      different style (see parameter STYLE).

      The application also computes statistics for those array values
      that lie between each pair of plotted lines.  In other words it
      finds the statistics between clipping limits defined by each
      2$*$NSIGMA range centred on the unclipped mean.

      The task tabulates NSIGMA, the mean, the standard deviation, and
      the error in the mean after the application of each pair of
      clipping limits.  For comparison purposes the first line of the
      table presents these values without clipping.  The table is
      written at the normal reporting level.

         string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text file
         preceded by an up-arrow character {\tt "}$\wedge${\tt "}. Such text files should
         contain further comma-separated lists which will be read and
         interpreted in the same manner. Attribute settings are applied in
         the order in which they occur within the list, with later settings
         over-riding any earlier settings given for the same attribute.

         Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:

            $<$name$>$=$<$value$>$

         where $<$name$>$ is the name of a plotting attribute, and $<$value$>$ is
         the value to assign to the attribute. Default values will be

         defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied. See section {\tt "}Plotting

         attributes. Any unrecognised attributes are ignored (no error is
         reported).

         to specify the style for the lines (``Lines'' is recognised as a
         synonym for ``Curves''). These values apply to all
         lines unless subsequent attributes over-ride them. Attributes for
         individual clipping levels can be given by replacing {\tt "}Curves{\tt "} above
         by a string of the form {\tt "}Nsig$<$i$>${\tt "} where {\tt "}$<$i$>${\tt "} is an integer

         either a {\tt "}$+${\tt "} or a {\tt "}-{\tt "} to the {\tt "}Nsig$<$i$>${\tt "} string. Thus,
         {\tt "}Width(Nsig2-){\tt "} sets the line width for the lower of the two

      This application cleans a 1- or 2-dimensional NDF by removing defects smaller

      substantially flat.  The data variances provide the local noise
      estimate for the threshold, but if these are not available a
      variance for the whole of the image is derived from the mean
      squared deviations of the original and smoothed images.  The

         output pixels from being generated in regions where there are
         relatively few good pixels to contribute to the smoothed
         result.

         By default, a null ({\tt !}) value is used for WLIM, which causes
         the pattern of bad pixels to be propagated from the input

         \sstitem
         The algorithm is based on the relaxation method of repeatedly
         replacing each bad pixel with the mean of its four nearest
         neighbours.  Such a method converges to the required solution,
         but information about the good regions only propagates at a rate
         of about one pixel per iteration into the bad regions, resulting
         in slow convergence if large areas are to be filled.

         This application speeds convergence to an acceptable function by
         forming the replacement mean from all the pixels in the same
         image row and column, using a weight which decreases
         exponentially with distance and goes to zero after the first good
         pixel is encountered in any direction.  If there is variance
         information, this is included in the weighting so as to give more
         weight to surrounding values with lower variance.  The scale
         length of the exponential weight is initially set large, to allow
         rapid propagation of an approximate `smooth' solution into the
         bad regions---an initially acceptable solution is thus rapidly
         obtained (often in the first one or two iterations).  The scale
         length is subsequently reduced by a factor of 2 whenever the
         maximum absolute change occurring in an iteration has decreased
         by a factor of 4 since the current scale length was first used.
         In this way, later iterations introduce progressively finer
         detail into the solution.  Since this fine detail occurs
         predominantly close to the `crinkly' edges of the bad regions,
         the slower propagation of the solution in the later iterations is
         then less important.

         When there is variance processing the output variance is
         reassigned if either the input variance or data value was bad.
         Where the input value is good but its associated variance is bad,
         the calculation proceeds as if the data value were bad, except
         that only the variance is substituted in the output.  The new
         variance is approximated as twice the inverse of the sum of the
         weights.

         \sstitem
         The price of the above efficiency means that considerable
         workspace is required, typically two or three times the size of
         the input image, but even larger for the one and two-byte integer
         types.  If memory is at a premium, there is an option to process
         in blocks ({\it cf.}\ parameter MEMORY).  However, this may not give as
         good results as processing the array in full, especially when the
         bad-pixel regions span blocks.

         \sstitem
         The value of the parameter SIZE is not critical and the
         default value will normally prove effective.  It primarily
         affects the efficiency of the algorithm on various size scales.
         If the smoothing scale is set to a large value, large scale
         variations in the replacement function are rapidly found, while
         smaller scale variations may require many iterations.
         Conversely, a small value will rapidly produce the small scale
         variations but not the larger scale ones.  The aim is to select
         an initial value SIZE such that during the course of a few
         iterations, the range of size scales in the replacement function
         are all used.  In practice this means that the value of SIZE
         should be about half the size of the largest scale variations
         expected.  Unless the valid pixels are very sparse, this is
         usually determined by the `size' of the largest invalid region to
         be replaced.

         \sstitem
         An error results if the input NDF has no bad values to replace.

   \sstdescription{
      This application reads selected disc-FITS files.  The files may
      be Basic (simple) FITS, and/or have TABLE extensions (Harten
      {\it et al.}\ 1988).

      The programme reads a simple or a random-groups-format FITS file
      (Wells {\it et al.}\ 1981; Greisen \& Harten 1981), and writes the
      data into an NDF, and the headers into the NDF's FITS extension.
      Table-format files (Grosb{\o}l {\it et al.}\ 1988) are read, and the
      application creates two files: a text formatted table/catalogue
      and a FACTS description file (as used by SCAR) based upon the FITS
      header cards.  Composite FITS files can be processed.  You may
      specify a list of files, including wildcards.  A record of the
      FITS headers, and group parameters (for a group-format file) can
      be stored in a text file.

      There is an option to run in automatic mode, where the names of
      output NDF data structures are generated automatically, and you
      can decide whether or not format conversion is to be applied to
      all files (rather than being prompted for each).  This is very
      useful if there is a large number of files to be processed.  Even
      if you want unique file names, format-conversion prompting may be
      switched off globally.

         application, and therefore not prompted; and a global
         format-conversion switch may be set.  In manual mode the
         FITS header is reported, but not in automatic.

         In automatic mode the application generates a filename
         beginning with the input filename, less any extension.  For
         example, if the input file was {\tt saturn.fits} the filename of the
         output NDF would be {\tt saturn.sdf}, and an output table would be
         {\tt saturn.dat} with a description file {\tt dscfsaturn.dat}.
         If there are sub-files (more than one FITS object in the file)
         a suffix {\tt \_<subfile>} is appended.  So if {\tt saturn.fits}
         comprised a simple file followed by a table, the table would
         be called {\tt SATURN\_2.DAT} and the description file
         {\tt DSCFSATURN\_2.DAT}.  For group format a suffix
         {\tt G<groupnumber>} is appended.  Thus if {\tt saturn.fits}
         is a group format file, the first NDF created would be
         called {\tt saturn.sdf}, the second would be {\tt saturnG2.sdf}.

         Field 1:
            The name of the input extension component whose value is to be

            extension called CCDPACK; and \linebreak
            {\tt IRAS90.ASTROMETRY.EQUINOX} would
            copy the value of component EQUINOX in the structure
            ASTROMETRY in the extension IRAS90.  The extension may not be
            FITS.

         \sstitem
         Field 2:
            The name of the FITS keyword to which the value is to be
            copied.  Hierarchical keywords are not permissible.  The
            keyword name may be followed by a further keyword name in
            parentheses (and no spaces).  This second keyword defines the
            card before which the new keyword is to be placed.  If this
            second keyword is not present in the FITS extension or is not
            supplied, the new header card is placed at the end of the
            existing cards, but immediately before any END card.  For
            example, {\tt EQUINOX(EPOCH)} would write the keyword EQUINOX
            immediately before the existing card with keyword EPOCH.  FITS
            keywords are limited to 8 characters and may only comprise
            uppercase alphabetic characters, digits, underscore, and
            hyphen.  While it is possible to have multiple occurrences of
            the same keyword in a FITS header, it is regarded as bad
            practice.  For this and efficiency reasons, this programme
            only looks for the first appearance of a keyword when
            substituting the values, and so only the last value inserted
            appears in the final FITS extension.  (See {\tt "}Implementation
            Status{\tt "}.)

            appear in the header card as the value permits up to a maximum
            of 47 characters.

         The replacements are made in blocks of 32 to reduce the number

         possible to locate a new keyword before another keyword, provided

      This application reads selected files from a FITS tape.  The

      The programme reads a simple or a random-groups-format FITS file
      (Wells {\it et al.}\ 1981; Greisen \& Harten 1981), and writes the
      data into an NDF, and the headers into the NDF's FITS extension.
      Table-format files (Grosb{\o}l {\it et al.}\ 1988) are read, and the
      application creates two files: a text formatted table/catalogue
      and a FACTS description file (as used by SCAR) based upon the FITS
      header cards.  Composite FITS files can be processed.  You may
      specify a list of files, including wildcards.  A record of the
      FITS headers, and group parameters (for a group-format file) can
      be stored in a text file.

      output NDF data structures are generated automatically, and you
      can decide whether or not format conversion is to be applied to
      all files (rather than being prompted for each).  This is very

         For simple or group format FITS objects in automatic mode the
         application generates a filename beginning with a defined
         prefix followed by the number of the file on tape.  For
         example, if the prefix was {\tt "XRAY"} and the 25$^{\rm th}$ file of the
         tape was being processed, the filename of the NDF would be
         XRAY25.

         For table-format FITS objects in the automatic mode the
         application generates a filename beginning with a defined
         prefix followed by the number of the file on tape.  For
         example, if the prefix was {\tt "cat"} and the 9$^{\rm th}$ file of the tape
         was being processed, the filename of the table and its
         associated FACTS description file would be {\tt cat9.dat} and
         {\tt dscfcat9.dat} respectively.

	    been agreed, this encoding should be understood by any
	    FITS-WCS compliant software and it is likely to be adopted
	    widely for FITS data in future.

            method for transferring WCS information between AST-based

	 but fails to make equivalent modifications to the others.  If a

         no longer than 8 characters, and be a valid FITS keyword
         comprising only alphanumeric characters, hyphen, and underscore.
         Any lowercase letters are converted to uppercase and blanks
         are removed before insertion, or comparison with the existing
         keywords.

         The keywords {\tt " "}, {\tt "COMMENT"}, and {\tt "HISTORY"}
         are comment cards and do not have a value.

         The keyword must exist except for the {\tt "Write"} and
         {\tt "Exist"} commands.

         Both KEYWORD and POSITION keywords may have an occurrence
         specified in brackets {\tt []} following the name (the value
         of KEYWORD should then appear in quotes).  This enables editing of
         a keyword that is not the first occurrence of that keyword, or
         locate a edited keyword not at the first occurrence of the
         positional keyword.  Note that it is not normal to have
         multiple occurrences of a keyword in a FITS header, unless it
         is blank, COMMENT or HISTORY.  Any text between the brackets
         other than a positive integer is interpreted as the first
         occurrence.

      The file consists of a series of lines, one per editing
      instruction, although blank lines and lines beginning with a {\tt !} or
      {\tt \#} are treated as comments.  Note that the order does matter, as
      the edits are performed in the order given.

      The format is summarised below:

       {\tt command keyword\{[occurrence]\}\{(keyword\{[occurrence]\})\} \{value \{comment\}\}}

      where braces indicate optional values, and occur is the
      occurrence of the keyword.  In effect there are four fields
      delineated by spaces that define the edit operation, keyword,
      value and comment.

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         Field 1:
            This specifies the editing operation.  Allowed values are
            {\tt Delete}, {\tt Exist}, {\tt Move}, {\tt Read}, {\tt Write},
            and {\tt Update}, and can be
            abbreviated to the initial letter.  {\tt Delete} removes a named
            keyword.  {\tt Read} causes the value of a named keyword to be
            displayed to standard output.  {\tt Exist} reports {\tt TRUE}
            to standard output if the named keyword exists in the
            header, and {\tt FALSE} if the keyword is not present.
            {\tt Move} relocates a named keyword to
            be immediately before a second keyword.  When this positional
            keyword is not supplied, it defaults to the END card, and if
            the END card is absent, the new location is at the end of the
            headers.  {\tt Write} creates a new card given a value and an
            optional comment.  Its location uses the same rules as for the
            {\tt Move} command.  {\tt Update} revises the value and/or the comment.
            If a secondary keyword is defined explicitly, the card may be
            relocated at the same time.  {\tt Update} requires that the keyword
            exists.

         \sstitem
         Field 2:
            This specifies the keyword to edit, and optionally the
            position of that keyword in the header after the edit (for
            {\tt Move}, {\tt Write} and {\tt Update} edits).  The new
            position in the header
            is immediately before a positional keyword, whose name is
            given in parentheses concatenated to the edit keyword.  See
            {\tt "}Field 1{\tt "} for defaulting when the position
            parameter is not defined or is null.

            Both the editing keyword and position keyword may be
            compound to handle hierarchical keywords.  In this case the
            form is keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 {\em etc.}\  All
            keywords must be valid FITS keywords.  This means they must
            be no more than 8 characters long, and the only permitted
            characters are uppercase alphabetic, numbers, hyphen,
            and underscore. Invalid keywords will be rejected.

            Both the edit and position keyword may have an occurrence
            specified in brackets {\tt []}.  This enables editing of a keyword
            that is not the first occurrence of that keyword, or locate a
            edited keyword not at the first occurrence of the positional
            keyword.  Note that it is not normal to have multiple
            occurrences of a keyword in a FITS header, unless it is blank,
            COMMENT or HISTORY.  Any text between the brackets other than
            a positive integer is interpreted as the first occurrence.

            Use a null value ({\tt ' '} or {\tt " "}) if you want the
            card to be a comment with keyword other than COMMENT or
            HISTORY.  As blank keywords are used for hierarchical
            keywords, to write a comment in a blank keyword you must
            give a null edit keyword.  These have no keyword appearing
            before the left parenthesis or bracket, such as
            {\tt ()}, {\tt []}, {\tt [2]}, or {\tt (EPOCH)}.

         \sstitem
         Field 3:
            This specifies the value to assign to the edited keyword in
            the {\tt Write} and {\tt Update} operations, or the name of the new
            keyword in the {\tt Rename} modification.  If the keyword exists,
            the existing value or keyword is replaced, as appropriate.
            The data type used to store the value is inferred from the
            value itself.  See topic {\tt "}Value Data Type{\tt "}.

            For the {\tt Update} and {\tt Write} modifications there is a special
            value, {\tt \$V}, which means use the current value of the edited
            keyword, provided that keyword exists.  This makes it possible
            to modify a comment, leaving the value unaltered.  In addition
            {\tt \$V(}keyword{\tt)} requests that the value of the keyword given
            between the parentheses be assigned to the keyword being
            edited.

            The value field is ignored when the keyword is COMMENT,
            HISTORY or blank, and the modification is to {\tt Update}
            or {\tt Write}.

         \sstitem
         Field 4:
            This specifies the comment to assign to the edited keyword for
            the {\tt Write} and {\tt Update} operations.  A leading {\tt "/"} should not be
            supplied.

            There is a special value, {\tt \$C}, which means use the current
            comment of the edited keyword, provided that keyword exists.
            This makes it possible to modify a value, leaving the comment
            unaltered.  In addition {\tt \$C(}keyword{\tt)} requests that the comment
            of the keyword given between the parentheses be assigned to
            the edited keyword.

            To obtain leading spaces before some commentary, use a quote
            ({\tt{'}}) or double quote ({\tt{"}}) as the first character
            of the comment.
            There is no need to terminate the comment with a trailing and
            matching quotation character.  Also do not double quotes
            should one form part of the comment.

      Value Data Type

      The data type of a value is determined as follows:

         \sstitem
            For the text-file, values enclosed in quotes ({\tt{'}}) or doubled
            quotes ({\tt{"}}) are strings.  Note that numeric or logical string

            data type.  In the case of double precision, the type is set
            to real when the number of significant digits only warrants
            single precision.  If all the conversions failed the value
            is deemed to be a string.

           otherwise it is truncated; \\
           b) the keyword only contains uppercase Latin alphabetic
           characters, numbers, underscore, and hyphen (the header will
           not be copied to the extension except when the invalid
           characters are lowercase letters); \\
           c) value cards have an equals sign in column 9 and a space in
           column 10; \\
           d) quotes enclose character values; \\
           e) single quotes inside string values are doubled; \\
           f) character values are left justified to column 11 (retaining
           leading blanks) and contain at least 8 characters (padding with
           spaces if necessary); \\
           g) non-character values are right justified to column 30, except
           for non-mandatory keywords which have a double-precision value
           requiring more than 20 digits; \\
           h) the comment delimiter is in column 32 or two characters
           following the value, whichever is greater; \\

         The validation can only go so far.  If any of your header lines
         are ambiguous, the resulting entry in the FITS extension may not
         be what you intended.  Therefore, you should inspect the
         resulting FITS extension using the command FITSLIST before
         exporting the data.  If there is something wrong, you may find it
         convenient to use command FITSEDIT to make minor corrections.

   FOURIER
}{
   Performs forward and inverse Fourier transforms of 1- or 2-dimensional NDFs
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application performs forward or reverse Fast Fourier
      Transforms (FFTs) of 1- or 2-dimensional NDFs.  The output in the 
      forward transformation (from the space domain to the Fourier) can
      be produced in Hermitian form in a single NDF, or as two NDFs giving
      the real and imaginary parts of the complex transform, or as two
      NDFs giving the power and phase of the complex transform.  Any
      combination of these may also be produced. The inverse procedure
      accepts any of these NDFs and produces a purely real output NDF.

      Any bad pixels in the input NDF may be replaced by a constant value.
      Input NDFs need neither be square, nor be a power of 2 in size in
      either dimension; their shape is arbitrary.

      The Hermitian transform is a single image in which each quadrant
      consisting of a linear combination of the real and imaginary
      parts of the transform.  This form is useful if you just want to
      multiply the Fourier transform by some known purely real mask and
      then invert it to get a filtered image.  However, if you want to
      multiply the Fourier transform by a complex mask ({\it e.g.}\ the
      Fourier transform of another NDF), or do any other operation
      involving combining complex values, then the Hermitian NDF must
      be untangled into separate real and imaginary parts.

      There is an option to swap the quadrants of the input NDF around
      before performing a forward FFT.  This is useful if you want to
      perform convolutions with the FFTs, since the point-spread
      function (PSF) image can be created with the PSF centre at the
      array centre, rather than at pixel (1,1) as is usually required.

         Where the histogram contains a few extreme outliers, the
         histogram limits are adjusted to reduce greatly the bias upon
         the statistics, even if a chosen percentile corresponds to an
         extreme outlier.  The outliers are still accounted in the median
         and percentiles.  The histogram normally uses 10000 bins.  For
         small arrays the number of bins is at most a half of the number

         one; this can also reduce the number of bins.  The goal is to
         avoid most histogram bins being empty artificially, since the
         sparseness of the histogram is the main criterion for detecting
         outliers.  Outliers can also be removed (flagged) via application
         THRESH prior to using this application.

         There is quantisation bias in the statistics, but for
         non-pathological distributions this should be insignificant.
         Accuracy to better than 0.01 of a percentile is normal.  Linear
         interpolation within a bin is used, so the largest errors arise
         near the median.

   Performs an histogram equalisation on an NDF
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application transforms an NDF via histogram equalisation.
      Histogram equalisation is an image-processing technique in which
      the distribution (between limits) of data values in the input
      array is adjusted so that in the output array there are
      approximately equal numbers of elements in each histogram bin.
      To achieve this the histogram bin size is no longer a constant.
      This technique is commonly known as histogram equalisation.  It
      is useful for displaying features across a wide dynamic range,
      sometimes called a maximum information picture.  The transformed
      array is output to a new NDF.

         where you give explicit numerical limits, the first sub-string
         must specify the method to use.  If supplied, the other two
         sub-strings should be numerical values as described below
         (default values will be used if these sub-strings are not
         provided).  The following options are available.

         \sstitemlist{

            \sstitem
            lower,upper -- You can supply explicit lower and upper
            limiting values.  For example, {\tt "10,200"} would set the histogram
            lower limit to 10 and its upper limit to 200.  No method name
            prefixes the two values.  If only one value is supplied,
            the {\tt "Range"} method is adopted.  The limits must be within the
            dynamic range for the data type of the NDF array component.

            \sstitem
            {\tt "Percentiles"} -- The default values for the histogram data
            range are set to the specified percentiles of the data.  For
            instance, if the value {\tt "Per,10,99"} is supplied, then the lowest
            10\% and highest 1\% of the data values are excluded from the
            histogram.  If only one value, $p1$, is supplied, the second
            value, $p2$, defaults to (100 - $p1$).  If no values are supplied,
            the values default to {\tt "5,95"}.  Values must be in the range 0 to
            100.

            \sstitem
            {\tt "Range"} -- The minimum and maximum array values are used.  No
            other sub-strings are needed by this option.  Null ({\tt !}) is a
            synonym for the {\tt "Range"} method.

            \sstitem
            {\tt "Sigmas"} -- The histogram limiting values are set to the
            specified numbers of standard deviations below and above the
            mean of the data.  For instance, if the supplied value is
            {\tt "sig,1.5,3.0"}, then the histogram extends from the mean of the
            data minus 1.5 standard deviations to the mean plus 3 standard
            deviations.  If only one value is supplied, the second value
            defaults to the supplied value.  If no values are supplied,
            both default to {\tt "3.0"}.

         }
         The {\tt "Percentiles"} and {\tt "Sigmas"} methods are useful to generate
         a first pass at the histogram.  They reduce the likelihood
         that all but a small number of values lie within a few
         histogram bins.

         The extreme values are reported unless parameter RANGE is
         specified on the command line.  In this case extreme values
         are only calculated where necessary for the chosen method.

         The method name can be abbreviated to a single character, and is
         case insensitive.  The initial value is {\tt "Range"}.  The suggested
         defaults are the current values, or {\tt !} if these do not exist.

      Navigating the Help Library
   }{
      The help information is arranged hierarchically.  You can
      move around the help information whenever KAPHELP prompts.  This
      occurs when it has either presented a screen's worth of text or
      has completed displaying the previously requested help.  The
      information displayed by KAPHELP on a particular topic includes
      a description of the topic and a list of subtopics that further
      describe the topic.

      At a prompt you may enter:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         a topic and/or subtopic name(s) to display the help for that
         topic or subtopic, so for example, {\tt block parameters box}
         gives help on {\tt BOX}, which is a subtopic of {\tt Parameters},
         which in turn is a subtopic of {\tt BLOCK};

         \sstitem 
         a {\tt $<$CR$>$} to see more text at a {\tt Press RETURN to
         continue ...} request;

         \sstitem
         a {\tt $<$CR$>$} at topic and subtopic prompts to move up one
         level in the hierarchy, and if you are at the top level it will
         terminate the help session;

         \sstitem
         a {\tt CTRL/D }(pressing the CTRL and D keys simultaneously) in
         response to any prompt will terminate the help session;

         \sstitem
         a question mark {\tt ?} to redisplay the text for the current topic,
         including the list of topic or subtopic names; or
 
         \sstitem
         an ellipsis {\tt ...} to display all the text below the current
         point in the hierarchy.  For example, {\tt BLOCK...} displays
         information on the BLOCK topic as well as information on all the
         subtopics under BLOCK.
      }
 
      You can abbreviate any topic or subtopic using the following rules.

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         Just give the first few characters, {\it e.g.}\ {\tt PARA} for
         {\tt Parameters}.
 
         \sstitem
         Some topics are composed of several words separated by
         underscores.  Each word of the keyword may be abbreviated,
         {\it e.g.}\ {\tt Colour\_Set} can be shortened to {\tt C\_S}.
 
         \sstitem
         The characters {\tt \%} and {\tt $\lsk$} act as wildcards, where
         the percent sign matches any single character, and asterisk
         matches any sequence of characters.  Thus to display information
         on all available topics, type an asterisk in reply to a prompt.

         \sstitem
         If a word contains, but does end with an asterisk wildcard, it
         must not be truncated.
 
         \sstitem
         The entered string must not contain leading or embedded spaces.

   Compares data sets using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine reads in a data array and performs a two sided
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the vectorised data.  It does this in
      two ways:

      \begin{enumerate}
      \item If only one dataset is to be tested the data array is
           divided into subsamples.  First it compares subsample 1 with
           subsample 2, if they are thought to be from the same sample
           they are concatenated.  This enlarged sample is then
           compared with subsample 3 {\em{etc.}}, concatenating if consistent,
           until no more subsamples remain.

       \item If more than one dataset is specified, the datasets are
           compared to the reference dataset in turn.  If the
           probability the two are from the same sample is greater than
           the specified confidence level, the datasets are
           concatenated, and the next sample is tested against this
           enlarged reference dataset.
       \end{enumerate}

      The probability and maximum separation of the cumulative
      distribution function is written for each comparison (at the
      normal reporting level).  The mean value of the consistent data
      and its error are also reported.  In all cases the consistent
      data can be output to a new dataset.  The statistics and
      probabilities are written to results parameters.

   LINPLOT
}{
   Draws a line plot of the data values in a 1-dimensional NDF
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application creates a plot of array value against position for
      a 1-dimensional NDF. The vertical axis of the plot represents array
      value (or the logarithm of the array value - see parameter YLOG),
      and the horizontal axis represents position.

      The plot may take several different forms such as a {\tt "}join-the-dots{\tt "}
      plot, a {\tt "}staircase{\tt "} plot, a {\tt "}chain{\tt "} plot, \emph{etc}, (see parameter MODE).
      Errors on both the data values and the data positions may be represented
      in several different ways (see parameters ERRBAR and SHAPE). The
      plotting style (colour, fonts, text size, \emph{etc}) may be specified in
      detail using parameter STYLE.

      The bounds of the plot on both axes can be specified using
      parameters XLEFT, XRIGHT, YBOT and YTOP. If not specified they take
      default values which encompass the entire supplied data set. The
      current picture is usually cleared before plotting the new picture,
      but parameter CLEAR can be used to prevent this, allowing several
      plots to be {\tt "}stacked{\tt "} together. If a new plot is drawn over an
      existing plot, then there is an option to allow the bounds of the
      new plot to be set to the bounds of the existing plot (see parameter
      ALIGN).

      The input NDF may, for instance, contain a spectrum of data values
      against wavelength, or it may contain data values along a
      1-dimensional profile through an NDF of higher dimensionality. In
      the latter case, the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF may have
      more than 1 axis. Any of the axes in the current co-ordinate Frame
      of the input NDF may be used to annotate the horizontal axis of the
      plot produced by this application. Alternatively, the horizontal
      axis may be annotated with offset from the first array element
      measured within the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF. For
      instance, a 1-d slice through a 2-d image calibrated in RA/DEC could
      be annotated with RA, or DEC, or offset from the first element (in
      arc-minutes, degrees, \emph{etc}). This offset is measured along the path
      of the profile. The choice of annotation for the horizontal axis is
      controlled by parameter USEAXIS.

   \sstdescription{
      This application creates a catalogue containing a list of positions
      supplied by the user, together with information describing the
      co-ordinate Frames in which the positions are defined. Integer
      position identifiers which allow positions to be distinguished are
      also stored in the catalogue. The catalogue may be manipulated
      using the CURSA package (SUN/190), and is stored in either FITS
      binary format or the {\tt "}Small Text List{\tt "} (STL) format defined by CURSA.

      If an NDF is specified using parameter NDF, then the positions should
      be given in the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF. Information
      describing the co-ordinate Frames available within the NDF will be
      copied to the output positions list. Subsequent applications can
      use this information in order to align the positions with other
      data sets.

      If no NDF is specified, then the user must indicate the co-ordinate
      Frame in which the positions will be supplied using parameter FRAME.
      A description of this Frame will be written to the output positions
      list for use by subsequent applications.

      The positions themselves may be supplied within a text file,
      or may be given in response to repeated prompts for a parameter.
      Alternatively, the pixel centres in the NDF supplied for parameter
      NDF can be used (see parameter MODE).

      The output can be initialised by copying positions from an existing
      positions list. Any positions supplied directly by the user are then
      appended to the end of this initial list (see parameter INCAT).

   \sstdescription{
      This application deconvolves the supplied 1- or 2-dimensional array
      using the Richardson-Lucy (R-L) algorithm.  It takes an array holding
      observed data and another holding a Point-Spread Function (PSF) as
      input and produces an output array with higher resolution.  The
      algorithm is iterative, each iteration producing a new estimate
      of the restored array which (usually) fits the observed data more
      closely than the previous estimate (in the sense that simulated
      data generated from the restored array is closer to the observed
      data).  The closeness of the fit is indicated after each iteration
      by a normalised $\chi^{2}$ value ({\it i.e.}\ the $\chi^{2}$ per
      pixel).  The algorithm terminates when the normalised $\chi^{2}$ 
      given by parameter AIM is reached, or the maximum number of
      iterations given by parameter NITER have been performed.  The
      current estimate of the restored array is then written to the
      output NDF.

      Before the first iteration, the restored array is initialised
      either to the array given by parameter START, or, if no array is
      given, to the difference between the mean value in the input data
      array and the mean value in the background (specified by
      parameters BACK and BACKVAL).  Simulated data is then created from
      this trial array by smoothing it with the supplied PSF, and then
      adding the background on.  The $\chi^{2}$ value describing the
      deviation of this simulated data from the observed data is then
      found and displayed.  If the required $\chi^{2}$ is not reached
      by this simulated data, the first iteration commences, which
      consists of creating a new version of the restored array and then
      creating new simulated data from this new restored array (the
      corresponding $\chi^{2}$ value is displayed).  Repeated
      iterations are performed until the required $\chi^{2}$ is
      reached, or the iteration limit is reached.  The new version of
      the restored array is created as follows.

      \begin{enumerate}

         \item A correction factor is found for each data value.  This is
         the ratio of the observed data value to the simulated data
         value.  An option exists to use the Snyder modification as
         used by the LUCY program in the {\footnotesize STSDAS} package within
         {\footnotesize IRAF}.  With this option selected, the variance
         of the observed
         data value is added to both the numerator and the denominator
         when finding the correction factors.

         \item These correction factors are mapped into an array by
         smoothing the array of correction factors with the transposed
         PSF.

         \item The current version of the restored array is multiplied by
         this correction factor array to produce the new version of the
         restored array.

      \end{enumerate}

         algorithm sometimes has difficulty fitting bright features and so 
         may not reach the required normalised $\chi^{2}$ value.  Setting
         CHIFAC to 1 (as is done by the LUCY program in the STSDAS
         package within IRAF) causes larger data values to be given

         If the input array contains bad pixels, then this parameter
         may be used to determine the number of good data values which
         must contribute to an output pixel before a valid value is
         stored in the restored array.  It can be used, for example, to
         prevent output pixels from being generated in regions where
         there are relatively few good data values to contribute to the
         restored result. It can also be used to `fill in{\tt '} small areas
         (\emph{i.e.} smaller than the PSF) of bad pixels.

         The numerical value given for WLIM specifies the minimum total
         weight associated with the good pixels in a smoothing box
         required to generate a good output pixel (weights for each
         pixel are defined by the normalised PSF).  If this specified
         minimum weight is not present, then a bad output pixel will
         result, otherwise a smoothed output value will be calculated.
         The value of this parameter should lie between 0.0 and
         1.0.  WLIM=0 causes a good output value to be created even if
         there is only one good input value, whereas WLIM=1 causes a
         good output value to be created only if all input values are
         good.  Values less than 0.5 will tend to reduce the number of
         bad pixels, whereas values larger than 0.5 will tend to
         increase the number of bad pixels.

         This threshold is applied each time a smoothing operation is
         performed.  Many smoothing operations are typically performed
         in a run of LUCY, and if WLIM is larger than 0.5 the effects
         of bad pixels will propagate further through the array at each
         iteration.  After several iterations this could result in there
         being no good data left.  An error is reported if this

   \sstdescription{
      This application allows manipulation of the colour table of an
      graphics device provided some data are, according to the
      graphics database, already displayed upon the device.  A
      2-dimensional data array, stored in the input NDF structure, may
      be nominated to assist in defining the colour table via an histogram
      equalisation.  There are two stages to the running of this
      application.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item The way in which the lookup table (LUT) is to distributed
      amongst the pens (colour indices) of the colour table is
      required.  Some pens are reserved by {\footnotesize KAPPA} as a palette, particularly
      for annotation.  This application only modifies the unreserved
      portion of the colour table.

      \item The lookup table is now chosen from a programmed selection or
      read from an NDF.
      \end{enumerate}

      The two stages may be repeated cyclically if desired.  To exit the
      loop give the null response, {\tt !}, to a prompt.  Looping will not
      occur if the lookup table and the distribution method are supplied

      of colour which ramps through the colour table, a histogram-style
      key in which the width of the block reflects the number of pixels
      allocated to each colour index, or a set of RGB intensity curves.
      The choice is made using the STYLE parameter.

      By default, numerical data values are displayed along the long edge of
      the key. The values corresponding to the maximum and minimum colour
      index are supplied using parameters HIGH and LOW. Intermediate colour
      indices are labelled with values which are linearly interpolated
      between these two extreme values.

      The rectangular area in which the key (plus annotations) is drawn
      may be specified either using a graphics cursor, or by specifying the
      co-ordinates of two corners using parameters LBOUND and UBOUND.
      Additionally, there is an option to make the key fill the current

         Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:

      surface. The order of the axes can also be changed at the same time.

      of the corresponding axis of the output - either the index of one of
      the pixel axes of the input, or a zero indicating that the input
      should be expanded with copies of itself along that axis.  If any
      axis of the input NDF is not referenced in the AXES list, the

      Calculating Variance
   }{
      The algorithm used to calculate output variance values is
      general-purpose and will give correct results for any reasonably
      well-behaved mathematical expression.  However, this application
      as a whole, and the variance calculations in particular, are
      likely to be less efficient than a more specialised application
      written knowing the form of the mathematical expression in
      advance.  For simple operations (addition, subtraction, {\it etc.}) the
      use of other applications (ADD, SUB, {\it etc.}) is therefore
      recommended, particularly if variance calculations are required.

      The main value of the variance estimation algorithm used here
      arises when the expression to be evaluated is too complicated, or
      too infrequently used, to justify the work of deriving a direct
      formula for the variance.  It is also of value when the data
      errors are especially large, so that the linear approximation
      normally used in error analysis breaks down.

      There is no variance processing when there are no tokens for
      input NDF structures.
   }
   \sstdiytopic{
      Timing
   }{
      If variance calculations are not being performed, then the time
      taken is approximately proportional to the number of NDF pixels
      being processed.  The execution time also increases with the
      complexity of the expression being evaluated, depending in the
      usual way on the nature of any arithmetic operations and
      intrinsic functions used.  If certain parts of the expression will
      often give rise to illegal operations (resulting in bad pixels),
      then execution time may be minimised by placing these operations
      near the beginning of the expression, so that later parts may not
      need to be evaluated.

      If output variance values are being calculated and the QUICK
      parameter is set to {\tt TRUE}, then the execution time will be
      multiplied by an approximate factor ($N+$1), where $N$ is the number
      of input NDFs which contain a variance component.  If QUICK is set
      to {\tt FALSE}, then the execution time will be multiplied by an
      approximate factor ($2N+$1).

      This task filters the 2-dimensional data array in the input NDF
      structure with a Weighted Median Filter (WMF) in a 3-by-3-pixel
      kernel to create a new NDF.  There are a number of predefined
      weighting functions and parameters that permit other symmetric
      weighting functions.  See parameter MODE and the topic
      {\tt "}User-defined Weighting Functions{\tt "}.

      A threshold for replacement of a value by the median can be set.
      If the absolute value of the difference between the actual value
      and the median is less than the threshold, the replacement will
      not occur.  The array boundary is dealt by either pixel
      replication or a reflection about the edge pixels of the array.

      The WMF can be repeated iteratively a specified number of times,
      or it can be left to iterate continuously until convergence is
      achieved and no further changes are made to the data.  In the
      latter case a damping algorithm is used if the number of
      iterations exceeds some critical value, which prevents the result
      oscillating between two solutions (which can sometimes happen).
      When damping is switched on data values are replaced not by the
      median value, but by a value midway between the original and the
      median.

      Bad pixels are not included in the calculation of the median.
      There is a defined threshold which specifies minimum-allowable
      median position as a fraction of the median position when there
      are no bad pixels.  For neighbourhoods with too many bad pixels,
      and so the median position is too small, the resulting output
      pixel is bad.

         parameter ANALYSE will be defaulted to {\tt TRUE}, and an analysis
         will be performed.  This effectively results in the
         deconvolution being multiplied by the data array of the NDF
         called nucleus, and the total data sum in the resulting image
         being displayed, together with the standard deviation on the
         total data sum.  The image in m51\_hires is the most probable
         deconvolution, but there may be other deconvolutions only
         slightly less probable than m51\_hires.  The standard deviation
         produced by an analysis takes account of the spread between
         such deconvolutions.  If the total data sum is not significantly
         greater than the standard deviation, then the feature selected
         by the mask image (called nucleus in this case) may well be
         spurious.  The mask image itself may for instance consist of an
         area of uniform value $+$1 covering some feature of interest,
         and the bad value (or equivalently the value zero) everywhere
         else.  The analysis would then give the integrated flux in the
         feature, assuming that the background is known to be zero.  If
         the background is not zero, then the mask may contain a
         background region containing the value $-$1, of equal area to
         the region containing the value $+$1.  The resulting integrated
         flux would then be the total flux in the source minus the flux

         MEM2D requires a large quantity of memory---almost as much as
         the rest of {\footnotesize KAPPA}.  In order for the {\footnotesize KAPPA} monolith to
         load without you having to increase your memory or datasize
         resources, and because MEM2D is batch oriented (see Timing) it
         is only available as a separate application.

         \sstitem
         Memory is required to store several intermediate images while
         the deconvolution is in progress.  If the input image is small
         enough, these images are stored in a statically declared, internal
         array.  Otherwise, they are stored in dynamically mapped external
         arrays.  There is no limit on the size of image which can be
         processed by MEM2D (other than those imposed by limited resources
         on the host computer).

         \sstitem
         It is sometimes desirable for the pixels in the output image
         to be smaller than those in the input image.  For instance, if the
         input data are critically sampled (two samples per PSF), the output
         image may not be a very good deconvolution.  In such cases
         sub-dividing the output pixels would give better results.  At the
         moment MEM2D cannot do this.  Be warned that sub-dividing the
         input pixels and then running the current version of MEM2D will not
         have the same effect, since the noise in the input image will then
         have pixel-to-pixel correlations, and be interpreted as real structure.

      Timing
   }{
      MEM deconvolution is extremely CPU intensive.  The total CPU time
      taken depends partly on the size of the image, and partly on the
      complexity of the structure within the image.  As a typical
      example, a 100$\times$100 image containing 20 Gaussians on a flat
      background took about 34 minutes of elapsed time on an unloaded
      DEC Alpha 2000.  Deconvolution jobs should therefore always be done
      in batch.  To perform an analysis on a deconvolution takes about the
      same length of time as a single deconvolution iteration.

   Draws a multi-line plot of the data values in a 2-dimensional NDF

   \sstdescription{
      This application plots a set of curves giving array value against
      position in a 2-dimensional NDF. All the curves are drawn within a
      single set of annotated axes. Each curve is displaced vertically by
      a specified offset to minimise overlap between the curves. These
      offsets may be chosen automatically or specified by the user (see
      parameter SPACE). The curves may be drawn in several different ways
      such as a {\tt "}join-the-dots{\tt "} plot, a {\tt "}staircase{\tt "} plot, a {\tt "}chain{\tt "} plot,
      \emph{etc}, (see parameter MODE).

      The data represented by each curve can be either a row or column
      (chosen using parameter ABSAXS) of any array component within the
      supplied NDF (see parameter COMP). Vertical error bars may be drawn if
      the NDF contains a Variance component (see parameter ERRBAR). The
      vertical axis of the plot represents array value (or the logarithm of
      the array value - see parameter YLOG). The horizontal axis represents
      position, and may be annotated using an axis selected from the Current
      Frame of the NDF (see parameter USEAXIS).

      Each curve may be labelled using its pixel index or a label specified
      by the user (see parameters LINLAB and LABELS). The appearance of these
      labels (size, colour, font, horizontal position, \emph{etc}.) can be
      controlled using parameter STYLE. A key may be produced to the left
      of the main plot listing the vertical offsets of the curves (see
      parameter KEY). The appearance of the key may be controlled using
      parameter KEYSTYLE. Its position may be controlled using parameter
      KEYOFF. Markers indicating the zero point for each curve may also be
      drawn within the main plot (see parameter ZMARK).

      The bounds of the plot on both axes can be specified using
      parameters XLEFT, XRIGHT, YBOT and YTOP. If not specified they take
      default values which encompass the entire supplied data set. The
      current picture is usually cleared before plotting the new picture,
      but parameter CLEAR can be used to prevent this, allowing several
      plots to be {\tt "}stacked{\tt "} together. If a new plot is drawn over an
      existing plot, then the bounds of the new plot are set automatically

      then ignored).

   Calculate statistics over a group of data arrays or points

   \sstdescription{
      This application calculates cumulative statistics over a group
      of NDFs.  It can either generate the statistics of each
      corresponding pixel in the input array components and output
      a new NDF with array components containing the result, or
      calculate statistics at a single point specified in the
      current co-ordinate Frame of the input NDFs.

      In array mode (SINGLE=FALSE), statistics are calculated for each
      pixel in one of the array components (Data, Variance or Quality)
      accumulated over all the input NDFs and written to an output
      NDF; each pixel of the output NDF is a result of combination
      of pixels with the same Pixel co-ordinates in all the input NDFs.
      If SMODE={\tt "}Mean{\tt "} then the output NDF has a Data component giving
      the pixel averages of the input NDFs, and a Variance component
      giving the variances.  If SMODE={\tt "}Median{\tt "}, then the output NDF
      has only a Data component, which gives the medians.  The data type
      of the output arrays will be of a floating point type even if
      the input arrays were of an integer type.  The input NDFs
      must all have the same number of dimensions, but need not all
      be the same shape.  The shape of the output NDF can be set
      to either the intersection or the union of the shapes of the
      input NDFs using the TRIM parameter.

      In single pixel mode (SINGLE=TRUE) a position in the current
      co-ordinate Frame of all the NDFs is given, and the value at
      the pixel covering this point in each of the input NDFs is
      accumulated to form the result.  The result, and if VERB=TRUE
      the value of each contributing pixel, is reported directly

   Replaces all occurrences of magic value pixels in an NDF array

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This function replaces the standard `magic value' assigned to bad
      pixels in an NDF with an alternative value, or with random
      samples taken from a Normal distribution.  Input pixels which do
      not have the magic value are left unchanged.  The number of
      replacements is reported.  NOMAGIC's applications include the
      export of data to software that has different magic values or
      does not support bad values.

      If a constant value is used to replace magic values (which will
      be the case if parameter SIGMA is given the value zero), then the
      same replacement value is used for both the data and variance
      arrays when COMP={\tt "All"}.  If the variance is being processed, the
      replacement value is constrained to be non-negative.

      Magic values are replaced by random values if the parameter SIGMA
      is given a non-zero value. If both Data and Variance components
      are being processed, then the random values are only stored in
      the Data component; a constant value equal to SIGMA squared is
      used to replace all magic values in the variance component.  If
      only a single component is being processed (whether it be Data,
      Variance, or Error), then the random values are used to replace
      the magic values.  If random values are generated which will not
      fit into the allowed numeric range of the output NDF, then they
      are discarded and new random values are obtained instead.  This
      continues until a usable value is obtained. This could introduce
      some statistical bias if many such re-tries are performed.  For
      this reason SIGMA is restricted so that there are at least 4
      standard deviations between the mean (given by REPVAL) and the
      nearest limit.  NOMAGIC notifies of any re-tries that are
      required.

      This application compares the data values in one NDF against the

      sets of data values in order to determine the relative scale
      factor and any zero-level offset between the NDFs.  To reduce
      computation time, the data points are binned according to the
      data value in the first NDF.  The mean data value within each bin
      is used to find the fit and weights are applied according to the
      number of pixels which contribute to each bin.

      To guard against erroneous data values, which can corrupt the fit
      obtained, the application then performs a number of iterations.
      It calculates a noise estimate for each bin according to the rms
      deviation of data values in the bin from the straight-line fit
      obtained previously.  It then re-bins the data, omitting values
      which lie more than a specified number of standard deviations
      from the expected value in each bin.  The straight-line fit is
      then re-calculated.  You can specify the number of standard
      deviations and the number of iterations used.

      A plot is produced after the final iteration showing the bin
      centres, with error bars representing the spread of values in each
      bin.  The best fitting straight line is overlayed on this plot.

      Optionally, an output NDF can be created containing a normalised
      version of the data array from the first input NDF.

         contain further comma-separated lists which will be read and

         the order in which they occur within the list, with later settings
         over-riding any earlier settings given for the same attribute.

         Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:

            $<$name$>$=$<$value$>$

         where $<$name$>$ is the name of a plotting attribute, and $<$value$>$ is
         the value to assign to the attribute. Default values will be

   Obtains the value or values of an application parameter
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application reports the value or values of a parameter from
      a named task.  It does this by searching the parameter file of
      the task.  The purpose is to offer an easier-to-use interface for
      passing values (especially output parameters) between tasks in
      shell scripts.  The values are formatted in lines with as many
      values as can be accommodated across the screen up to a maximum of
      132 characters; values are space separated.  However, in scripts
      the values are likely to be written to a script variable.  Thus
      for example in the C-shell:

         \hspace{2.1em}{\tt set med = `parget median histat`}

      would redirect the output to shell variable med, and thus a
      reference to \$med would substitute the median value obtained the
      last time application HISTAT was invoked.  If the parameter
      comprises a vector of values these can be stored in a C-shell
      array.  For instance,

         \hspace{2.1em}{\tt set perval = `parget perval histat`}

      would assign elements of the shell array perval[1], perval[2],
      {\em etc.}\ to the last-computed percentile values of HISTAT.

   Defines a new graphics-database FRAME picture or an array of
   FRAME pictures
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application creates either one new graphics-database FRAME
      picture or a grid of new FRAME pictures.  It offers a variety of
      ways by which you can define a new picture{\tt '}s location and extent.
      You may constrain a new picture to lie within either the current
      or the BASE picture, and the new picture adopts the world
      co-ordinate system of that reference picture.

      You may specify a single new picture using one of three methods:
        1.  moving a cursor to define the lower and upper bounds via
            pressing choice number 1 (the application will instruct what
            to do for the specific graphics device), provided a cursor
            is available on the chosen graphics workstation;
        2.  obtaining the bounds from the environment (in world
            co-ordinates of the reference picture);
        3.  or by giving a position and size for the new picture. The
            position is specified by a two-character code. The first
            controls the vertical location, and may be {\tt "}T{\tt "}, {\tt "}B{\tt "}, or {\tt "}C{\tt "}
            to create the new picture at the top, bottom, or in the
            centre respectively.  The second defines the horizontal
            situation, and may be {\tt "}L{\tt "}, {\tt "}R{\tt "}, or {\tt "}C{\tt "} to define a new
            picture to the left, right, or in the centre respectively.
            Thus a code of {\tt "}BR{\tt "} will make a new picture in the
            bottom-right corner. The size of the new picture along each
            axis may be specified either in centimetres, or as a fraction
            of the corresponding axis of the reference picture. The picture
            may also be forced to have a specified aspect ratio.

      The picture created becomes the current picture on exit.

      Alternatively, you can create an array of n-by-m equal-sized
      pictures by giving the number of pictures in the horizontal and
      vertical directions.  These may or may not be abutted.  For easy
      reference in later processing the pictures may be labelled
      automatically.  The label consists of a prefix you define,
      followed by the number of the picture.  The numbering starts at a
      defined value, usually one, and increments by one for each new
      picture starting from the bottom-left corner and moving from left
      to right to the end of the line.  This is repeated in each line
      until the top-right picture.  Thus if the prefix were {\tt "}GALAXY{\tt "},
      the start number is one and the array comprises three pictures
      horizontally and two vertically, the top-left picture would have
      the label {\tt "}GALAXY4{\tt "}.  On completion the bottom-left picture in
      the array becomes the current picture.

         centrally within the section.  A filling factor of 1.0 means
         that the pictures in the array abut.  Smaller factors permit a
         gap between the pictures.  For example, FILL = 0.9 would give
         a gap between the created pictures of 10 per cent of the
         height and width of each picture, with exterior borders of 5
         per cent.  FILL must lie between 0.1 and 1.0. {\tt [1.0]}

   \sstdescription{
      This command creates a two-dimensional grid of equally sized
      new FRAME pictures in the graphics database.  The array of pictures
      do not have to abut, but abutting is the default.  The new pictures
      are formed within either the current or BASE picture, and they
      adopt the world co-ordinate system of that enclosing picture.  On
      completion, the bottom-left picture in the array becomes the
      current picture.

      For easy reference in later processing the pictures have integer
      labels.  The numbering starts at a defined value, usually one,
      and increments by one for each new picture starting from the
      bottom-left corner and moving from left to right to the end of
      the line.  This is repeated in each line until the top-right
      picture.

      This command is a synonym for {\tt picdef array 1.0 prefix=""}.

   Determines the parameters of a model star profile by fitting star

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application finds a set of parameters to describe a model
      Gaussian star image.  It can be used for profile-fitting stellar
      photometry, to evaluate correction terms to aperture
      photometry, or for filtering.

      The model has a radial profile:
      {\Large
      \[   D =  A \exp^{-0.5\,(r/\sigma)^{\gamma}} \]
      }where $r$ is calculated from the true radial distance from the star
      centre allowing for image ellipticity, $\sigma$ is the Gaussian
      precision constant or profile width.  The application combines a
      number of star images you specify  and determines a mean
      seeing-disc size, radial fall-off parameter ($\gamma$), axis ratio,
      and orientation of a model star image.

      A table, giving details of the seeing and ellipticity of each
      star image used can be reported to an output text file.  This
      table indicates if any star could not be used.  Reasons for
      rejecting stars are too-many bad pixels present in the image,
      the star is too close to the edge of the data array, the
      `star' is a poor fit to model or it could not be located.

      An optional plot of the mean profile and the fitted function may
      be produced.  The 2-dimensional point-spread function may be stored 
      in an NDF for later use, as may the 1-dimensional fitted profile.

               The data in each zone is processed to remove erroneous points
               and to find an average value.  A Gaussian profile is fitted to
               these average values and the derived amplitude is used to
               normalise the values to an amplitude of unity.  The normalised
               values are put into bins together with the corresponding data
               from all other stars and this binned data represents a
               weighted average radial profile for the set of stars, with the
               image ellipticity removed.  Finally a radial profile is fitted
               to these data, giving the radial profile parameter gamma and a

   \sstdescription{
      This application uses a specified Mapping to transform the pixel
      positions in an NDF. The specified Mapping should transform pixel
      co-ordinates in the input NDF into the corresponding pixel
      co-ordinates in the output NDF.

      By default, the bounds of the output pixel grid are chosen so that
      they just encompasses all the transformed input data, but they can
      be set explicitly using parameters LBOUND and UBOUND.

      The data value stored at each output pixel is determined by
      transforming the pixel co-ordinates at the centre of the output
      pixel using the inverse of the supplied Mapping. This gives the
      corresponding pixel co-ordinates in the input NDF. In general this
      input position will not correspond to a pixel centre, and so the
      input data arrays (Data and Variance) must be interpolated to obtain
      the values for the output pixel. The scheme used to perform this
      interpolation can be selected using parameter METHOD.

      The Mapping to use can be supplied in several different ways (see

      Sub-Pixel Interpolation Schemes
   }{
      There is no such thing as a perfect sub-pixel interpolation
      scheme and, in practice, all resampling will result in some
      degradation of gridded data.  A range of schemes is therefore
      provided, from which you can choose the one which best suits
      your needs.

      In general, a balance must be struck between schemes which tend
      to degrade sharp features in the data by smoothing them, and
      those which attempt to preserve sharp features. The latter will
      often tend to introduce unwanted oscillations, typically visible
      as {\tt "}ringing{\tt "} around sharp features and edges, especially if the
      data are under-sampled (\emph{i.e.} if the sharpest features are less
      than about two pixels across). In practice, a good interpolation
      scheme is likely to be a compromise and may exhibit some aspects
      of both these features.

      For under-sampled data, some interpolation schemes may appear to
      preserve data resolution because they transform single input
      pixels into single output pixels, rather than spreading their
      data between several output pixels. While this may look
      better cosmetically, it can result in a geometrical shift of
      sharp features in the data. You should beware of this if you
      plan to use such features (\emph{e.g.}) for image alignment.

      The following are two easy-to-use sub-pixel interpolation
      schemes which are generally applicable:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         {\tt "}Nearest{\tt "} -- This is the simplest possible scheme, in which
         the value of the input pixel with the nearest centre to the
         interpolation point is used. This is very quick to execute and
         will preserve single-pixel features in the data, but may
         displace them by up to half their width along each dimension. It
         often gives a good cosmetic result, so is useful for quick-look
         processing, but is unsuitable if accurate geometrical
         transformation is required.

         \sstitem
         {\tt "}Linear{\tt "} -- This scheme uses linear interpolation
         between the nearest neighbouring pixels in the
         input grid (there are two neighbours in one dimension, four
         neighbours in two dimensions, eight in three dimensions,
         \emph{etc}.). It is superior to the nearest-pixel scheme (above) in not
         displacing features in the data, yet it still executes fairly
         rapidly. It is generally a safe choice if you do not have any
         particular reason to favour another scheme, since it cannot
         introduce oscillations. However, it does introduce some spatial
         smoothing which varies according to the distance of the
         interpolation point from the neighbouring pixels. This can
         degrade the shape of sharp features in the data in a
         position-dependent way. It may also show in the output variance
         grid (if used) as a pattern of stripes or fringes.

      }
      An alternative set of interpolation schemes is based on forming
      the interpolated value from the weighted sum of a set of
      surrounding pixel values (not necessarily just the nearest
      neighbours). This approach has its origins in the theory of
      digital filtering, in which interpolated values are obtained by
      conceptually passing the sampled data (represented by a grid of
      delta functions) through a linear filter which implements a
      convolution. Because the convolution kernel is continuous, the
      convolution yields a continuous function which may then be
      evaluated at fractional pixel positions. The (possibly
      multi-dimensional) kernel is usually regarded as {\tt "}separable{\tt "} and
      formed from the product of a set of identical 1-dimensional
      kernel functions, evaluated along each dimension. Different
      interpolation schemes are then distinguished by the choice of
      this 1-dimensional interpolation kernel. The number of
      surrounding pixels which contribute to the result may also be
      varied.

      From a practical standpoint, it is useful to divide the weighted
      sum of pixel values by the sum of the weights when determining
      the interpolated value.  Strictly, this means that a true
      convolution is no longer being performed. However, the
      distinction is rarely important in practice because (for
      slightly subtle reasons) the sum of weights is always
      approximately constant for good interpolation kernels. The
      advantage of this technique, which is used here, is that it can
      easily accommodate missing data and tends to minimise unwanted
      oscillations at the edges of the data grid.

      In the following schemes, which are based on a 1-dimensional
      interpolation kernel, the first element of the PARAMS parameter
      should be used to specify how many pixels are to contribute to the
      interpolated result on either side of the interpolation point in
      each dimension (the nearest integer value is used). Execution time
      increases rapidly with this number. Typically, a value of 2 is
      appropriate and the minimum value used will be 1 (\emph{i.e.} two pixels
      altogether, on on either side of the interpolation point). A value
      of zero or less may be given for PARAMS(1) to indicate that a
      suitable number of pixels should be calculated automatically.

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         {\tt "}Sinc{\tt "} -- This scheme uses a sinc(pi$*$x) kernel, where x is the
         pixel offset from the interpolation point and sinc(z)=sin(z)/z. This
         sometimes features as an {\tt "}optimal{\tt "} interpolation kernel in books on
         image processing. Its supposed optimality depends on the assumption
         that the data are band-limited (\emph{i.e.} have no spatial frequencies above
         a certain value) and are adequately sampled. In practice, astronomical
         data rarely meet these requirements. In addition, high spatial
         frequencies are often present due (\emph{e.g.}) to image defects and cosmic
         ray events. Consequently, substantial ringing can be experienced with
         this kernel. The kernel also decays slowly with distance, so that
         many surrounding pixels are required, leading to poor performance.
         Abruptly truncating it, by using only a few neighbouring pixels,
         improves performance and may reduce ringing (if PARAMS(1) is set to
         zero, then only two pixels will be used on either side). However, a
         more gradual truncation, as implemented by other kernels, is generally
         to be preferred. This kernel is provided mainly so that you can
         convince yourself not to use it!

         \sstitem
         {\tt "}SincSinc{\tt "} -- This scheme uses an improved kernel, of the form
         sinc(pi$*$x).sinc(k$*$pi$*$x), with k a constant, out to the point where
         sinc(k$*$pi$*$x) goes to zero, and zero beyond. The second sinc() factor
         provides an {\tt "}envelope{\tt "} which gradually rolls off the normal sinc(pi$*$x)
         kernel at large offsets. The width of this envelope is specified by
         giving the number of pixels offset at which it goes to zero by means
         of the PARAMS(2) value, which should be at least 1.0 (in addition,
         setting PARAMS(1) to zero will select the number of contributing
         pixels so as to utilise the full width of the kernel, out to where it
         reaches zero). The case given by PARAMS(1)=2, PARAMS(2)=2 is typically
         a good choice and is sometimes known as the Lanczos kernel. This is a
         valuable general-purpose interpolation scheme, intermediate in its
         visual effect on images between the {\tt "}Nearest{\tt "} and {\tt "}Linear{\tt "}
         schemes. Although the kernel is slightly oscillatory, ringing is
         adequately suppressed if the data are well sampled.

         \sstitem
         {\tt "}SincCos{\tt "} -- This scheme uses a kernel of the form
         sinc(pi$*$x)$*$cos(k$*$pi$*$x), with k a constant, out to the point where
         cos(k$*$pi$*$x) goes to zero, and zero beyond. As above, the cos() factor
         provides an envelope which gradually rolls off the sinc() kernel
         at large offsets. The width of this envelope is specified by giving
         the number of pixels offset at which it goes to zero by means
         of the PARAMS(2) value, which should be at least 1.0 (in addition,
         setting PARAMS(1) to zero will select the number of contributing
         pixels so as to utilise the full width of the kernel, out to where it
         reaches zero). This scheme gives similar results to the
         {\tt "}SincSinc{\tt "} scheme, which it resembles.

         \sstitem
         {\tt "}SincGauss{\tt "} -- This scheme uses a kernel of the form
         sinc(pi$*$x).exp(-k$*$x$*$x), with k a positive constant. Here, the sinc()
         kernel is rolled off using a Gaussian envelope which is specified by
         giving its full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) by means of the PARAMS(2)
         value, which should be at least 0.1 (in addition, setting PARAMS(1)
         to zero will select the number of contributing pixels so as to utilise
         the width of the kernel out to where the envelope declines to 1\% of its
         maximum value). On astronomical images and spectra, good results are
         often obtained by approximately matching the FWHM of the
         envelope function, given by PARAMS(2), to the point spread function
         of the input data. However, there does not seem to be any theoretical
         reason for this.

      }
      In addition, the following scheme is provided which is not based
      on a 1-dimensional kernel:

      \sstitemlist{

         \sstitem
         {\tt "}BlockAve{\tt "} -- This scheme simply takes an average of all the
         pixels on the input grid in a cube centred on the interpolation
         point.  The number of pixels in the cube is determined by the
         value of the first element of the PARAMS array, which gives
         the number of pixels in each dimension on either side of the
         central point.  Hence a block of (2 $*$ PARAMS(1))$*$$*$NDIM\_IN
         pixels in the input grid will be examined to determine the
         value of the output pixel.  If the input NDF has no variance,
         then all valid pixels in this cube
         will be averaged in to the result with equal weight.
         If a variance is present, then each input pixel will be
         weighted proportionally to the reciprocal of its variance; any
         pixel without a valid variance will be discarded.  This scheme
         is suitable where the output grid is much coarser than the
         input grid; if the ratio of pixel sizes is R then a suitable
         value of PARAMS(1) may be R/2.

      This routine copies one or more polygonal segments from the first

      supplied as null ({\tt "}!{\tt "}) in which case the corresponding areas of the
      output NDF are filled with bad values. For instance, supplying a null
      value for IN2 allows segments to be cut from IN1 and pasted onto a
      background of bad values. Supplying a null value for IN1 allows
      {\tt "}holes{\tt "} to be cut out of IN2 and filled with bad values.

      Each polygonal segment is specified by giving the positions of its
      vertices. This may be done using a graphics cursor, by supplying
      a positions list or text file containing the positions, or by
      supplying the positions in response to a parameter prompt. The

      This application sets a new value for the bad-bits mask

      normally be used to generate `bad' pixels when the NDF is

      pixel is then considered `bad' if any of the extracted quality

      Axis Normalisation
   }{
      In general, the axis-normalisation property is not needed.  An
      example where it is relevant is a spectrum in which data values
      representing energy per unit wavelength and each pixel has a
      known spread in wavelength.  The sum of each pixel's data value
      multiplied by its width gives the energy in a part of the
      spectrum.  A change to the axis width, say to allow for the
      redshift, necessitates a corresponding modification to the data
      value to retain this property.  In two dimensions an example is
      where the data measure flux per unit area of sky and the pixel
      widths are defined in terms of angular size.

         \sstitem
         If WCS information is stored in the form of an IRAS90 astrometry
         structure (see parameter IRAS90), it will in general be invalidated

\manroutineitem {Description }{}
  The data array in the input {\mantt{IMAGE}} structure is shifted, in either
  or both of the {$x$} and {$y$} axes, to produce the new array, in the
  output image structure. The shifts in {$x$} and {$y$} are either input as
  absolute {$x$} and {$y$} shifts by the user, or alternatively, are
  calculated from the co-ordinates of two points provided by the
  user. These are a fiducial point, with co-ordinates {\mantt {\%FIDX}},
  {\mantt {\%FIDY}}, and a standard object, with co-ordinates {\mantt {\%OBJX}},
  {\mantt {\%OBJY}}. The shift in {$x$} is then given by
  {\mantt {\%FIDX}}{$-$}{\mantt {\%OBJX}} and the shift in {$y$} is given by
  {\mantt {\%FIDY}}{$-$}{\mantt {\%OBJY}}. The output data array is padded with
  zeros in the regions not occupied by the shifted input array.  Fractional
  shifts are computed by bilinear interpolation.

  The magic-value method is used for processing bad data.

}{
   \sstdescription{
      The background of a 2-dimensional data array in the supplied NDF
      structure is estimated by condensing the array into equally sized
      rectangular bins, fitting a spline or polynomial surface to the
      bin values, and finally evaluating the surface for each pixel in
      the data array.

      There is a selection of estimators by which representative
      values for each bin are determined.  There are several options to
      make the fit more accurate.  Values beyond upper and lower
      thresholds may be excluded from the binning.  Bad pixels are also
      excluded, so prior masking may help to find the background more
      rapidly.  Kappa-sigma clipping of the fitted bins is available
      so that the fit is not biased by anomalous bins, such as those
      entirely within an extended object.  If a given bin contains more
      than a prescribed fraction of bad pixels, it is excluded from the
      fit.

      The data array representing the background is evaluated at each
      pixel by one of two methods.  It is written to the output NDF
      structure.

      The raw binned data, the weights, the fitted binned data and the
      residuals to the fit may be written to a logfile.  This also
      keeps a record of the input parameters and the rms error of the
      fit.

   TRANDAT
}{
   Converts free-format text data into an NDF
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application takes grid data contained in a free-format text
      file and stores them in the data array of an NDF.  The data file
      could contain, for example, mapping data  or results from
      simulations which are to be converted into an image for analysis.

      There are two modes of operation which depend on whether the
      text file contains co-ordinate information, or solely data
      values (determined by parameter AUTO).

      a) {\bf AUTO=FALSE}  ~~If the file contains co-ordinate information
      the format of the data is tabular; the positions and values are
      arranged in columns and a record may contain information for only
      a single point.  Where data points are duplicated only the last
      value appears in the NDF.  Comment lines can be given, and are
      indicated by a hash or exclamation mark in the first column.
      Here is an example file (the vertical ellipses indicate missing
      lines in the file):
{\tt \begin{verse}
          \# Model 5, phi = 0.25,  eta = 1.7 \\
          1 -40.0   40.0   1121.9 \\
          2  0.0   30.0     56.3 \\
          3 100.0   20.0   2983.2 \\
          4 120.0   85.0    339.3 \\
          . ~. ~~. ~ .   \\
          . ~. ~~. ~ .   \\
          . ~. ~~. ~ .   \\
          <EOF>
\end{verse}}

      The records do not need to be ordered (but see the warning in the
      Notes), as the application searches for the maximum and minimum
      co-ordinates in each dimension so that it can define the size of
      the output image.  Also, each record may contain other data
      fields (separated by one or more spaces), which need not be all
      the same data type.  In the example above only columns 2, 3 and 4
      are required.  There are parameters (POSCOLS, VALCOL) which
      select the co-ordinate and value columns.

      The distance between adjacent pixels (given by parameter PSCALE)
      defaults to 1, and is in the same units as the read-in
      co-ordinates.  The pixel index of a data value is calculated
      using the expression

      \[   index = {\rm IFIX}( ( x - xmin ) / scale ) + 1 \]

      where $x$ is the supplied co-ordinate and $xmin$ is the minimum
      supplied co-ordinate along an axis, $scale$ is the value of
      parameter PSCALE, and IFIX converts from real to integer.

      You are informed of the number of points found and the maximum
      and minimum co-ordinate values for each dimension.  There is no
      limit imposed by the application on the number of points or the
      maximum output array size, though there may be external
      constraints.  The derived array size is reported in case you have
      made a typing error in the text file.  If you realise that this
      has indeed occurred just abort ({\tt !!}) when prompted for the output
      NDF.

      b) {\bf AUTO=TRUE}  ~~If the text file contains no co-ordinates, the
      format is quite flexible, however, the data are read into the data array
      in Fortran order, {\it i.e.}\ the first dimension is the most rapidly
      varying, followed by the second dimension and so on.  The number
      of data values that may appear on a line is variable; data values
      are separated by at least a space, comma, tab or carriage return.
      A line can have up to 255 characters.  In addition a record may
      have trailing comments designated by a hash or exclamation mark.
      Here is an example file, though a more regular format would be
      clearer for the human reader.
{\tt \begin{verse}
          \# test for the new TRANDAT \\
          23 45.3 ! a comment \\

           9.2 11. \\
          <EOF>
\end{verse}}

      Notice that the shape of the NDF is defined by a parameter rather
      than explicitly in the file.

         The application obtains work space to store the position-value
         data before they can be copied into the output NDF so that the
         array bounds can be computed.  Since the number of lines in
         the text file is unknown, the application obtains chunks of

         the order in which they occur within the list, with later settings
         over-riding any earlier settings given for the same attribute.

         Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:

            $<$name$>$=$<$value$>$

         where $<$name$>$ is the name of a plotting attribute, and $<$value$>$ is
         the value to assign to the attribute. Default values will be

         labels on the vector map axes. Thus a value of 2.0 for Size will

         no value is set for this attribute, and produces default vertical

      This application can be used to create a new AST Mapping and
      optionally use the Mapping to add a new co-ordinate Frame into
      the WCS component of an NDF (see parameter NDF). An output text file
      may also be created holding a textual representation of the
      Mapping for future use by other applications such as RESAMPLE (see
      parameter MAPOUT). A number of different types of Mapping can be
      used (see parameter MAPTYPE).

      When adding a new Frame to a WCS component, the Mapping is used to
      connect the the new Frame to an existing one (called the {\tt "}basis{\tt "}
      Frame). The newly added Frame is a copy of the basis Frame, with
      the new Domain attribute specified by parameter DOMAIN, and becomes
      the current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF. If necessary, other
      attributes of the new Frame (Title, Label, Format, \emph{etc}) can be
      changed using application WCSATTRIB.

      WCSADD will only generate Mappings with the same number of
      input and output axes; this number is determined by the number
      of axes in the basis Frame if an NDF is supplied, or by the
      NAXES parameter otherwise.

   Aligns a group of 2-dimensional NDFs using World Co-ordinate System

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application resamples a group of 2-dimensional input NDFs,
      producing corresponding output NDFs which are aligned pixel-for-pixel
      with a specified reference NDF.

      The transformations needed to produce alignment are derived from the
      co-ordinate system information stored in the WCS components of the
      supplied NDFs. For each input NDF, alignment is first attempted in
      the current co-ordinate Frame of the reference NDF. If this fails,
      alignment is attempted in the current co-ordinate Frame of the input
      NDF. If this fails, alignment occurs in the pixel co-ordinate Frame.
      A message indicating which Frame alignment was achieved in is
      displayed.

      The output image values are formed by re-sampling the input image
      values using either nearest neighbour or bi-linear interpolation
      (see parameter METHOD).

      Two methods exist for determining the bounds of the output images.
      Firstly, the user can give values for parameters LBND and UBND
      which are then used as the pixel index bounds for all output
      images. Secondly, if a null value is given for LBND or UBND,
      default values are generated separately for each output image so
      that the output image just encloses the entire area covered by the
      corresponding input image. Using the first method will ensure that
      all output images have the same pixel origin, and so the resulting
      images can be directly compared. However, this may result in the
      output images being larger than necessary. In general, the second
      method results in smaller images being produced, in less time.
      However, the output images will have differing pixel origins which
      need to be taken into account when comparing the aligned images.

         Bi-linear interpolation generally produces smoother output
         images with lower noise, but is marginally slower.

         Both methods propagate variances from input to output, but the
         variance estimates produced using bi-linear interpolation need
         to be treated with care since the spatial smoothing produced by
         this interpolation method introduces correlations in the
         variances estimates. Also, the degree of smoothing produced varies
         across the image. This is because a sample taken at a pixel centre
         will have no contributions from the neighbouring pixels, whereas a
         sample taken at the corner of a pixel will have equal contributions
         from all four neighbouring pixels, resulting in greater smoothing
         and lower noise. This effect can produce complex Moire patterns
         in the output variance estimates, resulting from the
         interference of the spatial frequencies in the sample positions
         and in the pixel centre positions. For these reasons, if you
         want to use the output variances, you are generally safer using
         nearest neighbour interpolation. {\tt [}current value{\tt ]}

         This example assumes that the application SQORST has previously
         been used to change the size of a 2-dimensional NDF called m51,
         producing a new NDF called m51\_sqorst. Since SQORST has not yet
         been updated to support the full NDF structure, the output NDF
         m51\_sqorst will not have a WCS component. More than this, SQORST
         also throws away the pixel origin information, effectively
         resetting the output origin to (1,1). This example shows how
         WCSCOPY can be used to rectify this by copying the WCS component
         from the original NDF m51 to the squashed NDF m51\_sqorst,
         modifying it in the process to take account of both the
         squashing and the resetting of the pixel origin produced by
         sqorst. To do this, you need to work out the transformation in
         pixel co-ordinates produced by SQORST, and specify this when
         running WCSCOPY using the TR parameter. Let{\tt '}s assume the first
         axis of NDF m51 has pixel index bounds of I1:I2 (these values
         can be found using NDFTRACE). If the first axis in the squashed
         NDF m51\_sqorst spans M pixels (where M is the value assigned to
         SQORST parameter XDIM), then it will have pixel index bounds of
         1:M. Note, the lower bound is 1 since the pixel origin has been
         reset by SQORST. The squashing factor for the first axis is
         then:
          \[
          FX = M/(I2 - I1 + 1)
          \]
         and the shift in the pixel origin is:
          \[
          SX = FX*( 1 - I1 )
          \]
         Likewise, if the bounds of the second axis in m51 are J1:J2, and
         SQORST parameter YDIM is set to N, then the squashing factor for
         the second axis is:
          \[
          FY = N/(J2 - J1 + 1)
          \]
         and the shift in the pixel origin is:
          \[
          SY = FY*( 1 - J1 )
          \]
         You would then use the following values for parameter TR when
         running WCSCOPY:
          \[
          TR = [SX, FX, 0.0, SY, 0.0, FY]
          \]
         Note, the zero terms indicate that the axes are independent (i.e.
         there is no rotation of the image). The numerical values in the
         example are for an image with pixel index bounds of 52:251 on both
         axes which was squashed by SQORST to produce an image with 100 pixels
         on each axis.

         The application POW has been used to process a
         2-dimensional NDF called m51, producing a new NDF called
         m51\_pow. Since POW has not yet been updated to support the
         full NDF structure, the output NDF m51\_pow will not have a WCS
         component. More than this, POW also throws away the pixel origin
         information, effectively resetting the output origin to (1,1). You
         can use WCSCOPY to rectify this by copying the WCS component from
         the original NDF m51 to the processed NDF m51\_pow, modifying it
         in the process to take account of the resetting of the pixel origin
         produced by POW. To do this, you to work out the transformation
         in pixel co-ordinates produced by POW, and specify this when
         running WCSCOPY using the TR parameter. Let{\tt '}s assume the first axis
         of NDF m51 has pixel index bounds of I1:I2 (these values can be
         found using NDFTRACE). POW will produce an image with the
         same number of pixels along the axis but the first pixel will have
         index 1 instead of I1. Thus the shift in the pixel origin is:
          \[
          SX = ( 1 - I1 )
          \]
         Likewise, the first pixel on the second axis will be reset to 1
         by POW, and so if the bounds of the second axis in m51 are J1:J2,
         the shift in the pixel origin for the second axis is:
          \[
          SY = ( 1 - J1 )
          \]
         You would then use the following values for parameter TR when
         running WCSCOPY:
          \[
          TR = [SX, 1.0, 0.0, SY, 0.0, 1.0]
          \]
         Note, the zero terms indicate that the axes are independent (i.e.
         there is no rotation of the image), and the 1.0 terms indicate
         that the pixels are not changed in size. The numerical values in the
         example are for an image with pixel index bounds of 52:251 on both
         axes. Another (maybe simpler) way to rectify the loss of origin
         information is to use application SETORIGIN to restore the pixel
         origin, and then use WCSCOPY, accepting the default null value for
         the parameter TR.

   WIENER
}{
   Applies a Wiener filter to a 1- or 2-dimensional array
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application filters the supplied 1- or 2-dimensional array
      using a Wiener filter.  It takes an array holding observed data
      and another holding a Point-Spread Function as input and produces
      an output restored array with potentially higher resolution and
      lower noise.  Generally superior results can be obtained using
      applications MEM2D or LUCY, but at the cost of much more
      processing time.

      The Wiener filter attempts to minimise the mean squared
      difference between the undegraded image and the restored image.
      To do this it needs to know the power spectrum of the undegraded
      image (\emph{i.e.} the power at each spatial frequency before the
      instrumental blurring and the addition of noise).  Obviously,
      this is not usually available, and instead the power spectrum of
      some other image must be used (the `model{\tt '} image).  The idea is
      that a model image should be chosen for which there is some a
      priori reason for believing it to have a power spectrum similar
      to the undegraded image.  Many different suggestions have been
      made for the best way to make this choice and the literature
      should be consulted for a detailed discussion (for instance, see
      the paper {\tt "}Wiener Restoration of HST Images: Signal Models and
      Photometric Behavior{\tt "} by I.C. Busko in the proceedings of the
      first Annual Conference  on Astronomical Data Analysis Software
      and Systems, Tucson).  By default, this application uses a
      `white{\tt '} model image, \emph{i.e.} one in which there is equal power at
      all spatial frequencies.  The default value for this constant
      power is the mean power per pixel in the input image.  There is
      also an option to use the power spectrum of a supplied model
      image.

      The filter also depends on a model of the noise in the supplied
      image.  This application assumes that the noise is {\tt '}white{\tt '} and is
      constant across the image.  You can specify the noise power
      to use.  If a noise power of zero is supplied, then the Wiener
      filter just becomes a normal inverse filter which will tend to
      amplify noise in the supplied image.

      The filtering is done by multiplying the Fourier transform of the
      supplied image by the Fourier transform of the filter function.
      The output image is then created by taking the inverse Fourier
      transform of the product. The Fourier transform of the filter
      function is given by:

         {\Large
         \[ \frac{H^{\ast}}{ \left | H \right |^{2} + \frac{P_{n}}{P_{g}}} \]
         }

      where $H$ is the Fourier transform of the supplied Point-Spread
      Function, $P_{n}$ is the noise power, $P_{g}$ is the power in the model
      image, and $H^{\ast}$ is the complex conjugate of $H$. If the
      supplied model includes noise (as indicated by parameter QUIET)
      then $P_{n}$ is subtracted from $P_{g}$ before evaluating the above
      expression.

         Bounds supplied in Interface and File mode are transformed into
         the PIXEL Frame of the input NDF before being used.

         \sstitem
         Complicated results arise if the axes of the current Frame of the
         input NDF are not parallel to the pixel axes. In these cases it is
         usually better to switch to the PIXEL Frame (using WCSFRAME) prior to
         using ZAPLIN. Roughly speaking, the range of pixel lines and/or
         columns which are replaced will include any which intersect the
         specified range on the current Frame axis.

         \sstitem
         When using input files care should be taken to ensure that
         the co-ordinate system used in the file matches the current
         co-ordinate Frame of the input NDF.

         \sstitem
         If the input NDF is a section of an NDF with a higher
         dimensionality, the {\tt "}lines{\tt "} and {\tt "}columns{\tt "} are with respect to the
         2-dimensional section, and do not necessarily refer to the first
         and second dimensions of the NDF as a whole.  See the {\tt "}Examples{\tt "}.

\section{\xlabel{ap_colset}Standard Named Colours\label{ap:colset}}
The standard set of named colours recognised by {\footnotesize KAPPA} is
tabulated below together with their red, green, and blue relative
intensities.  It is the X-windows standard colour set so don't blame
{\footnotesize KAPPA} if you think some of them are anomalous.  In addition to
those tabulated, there are grey levels at each percentage between
``Black'' and ``White''.  These are called ``Grey1'', ``Grey2'', \dots,
``Grey99''.  All the names containing ``Grey'' have synonyms spelt with
``Gray''.  \medskip

\section{\xlabel{ap_NDFformat}Standard Components in an NDF
\label{ap:NDFformat}}

An NDF comprises a main data array plus a collection of objects drawn
from a set of standard items and extensions (see \xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{}).
Only the main data array must be present; all the other items are optional.

{\tt \$KAPPA\_DIR/example.sdf} is an NDF which contains all the standard 
NDF components, except a WCS component and a FITS extension; it also has 
a FIGARO extension.
The structure of the file (as revealed by
{\tt \%~hdstrace \$KAPPA\_DIR/example}) is shown below.  The layout is
\begin{verbatim} 
     NAME(dimensions)    <TYPE>     VALUE(S)
\end{verbatim}
Note that scalar objects have no dimensions and that each level down the
hierarchy is indented.

\end{verbatim}

Of course, this is only an example format.  There are various ways of
representing some of the components.  These {\em variants\/} are
described in \xref{SGP/38}{sgp38}{}, but not all are currently supported.

The components are considered in detail below.  The names (in bold
typeface) are significant as they are used by the NDF access routines to
identify the components. 

\begin{description}

\item[{\bf DATA}] -- the main data array is the only component which
must be present in an NDF.  In the case of {\tt example.sdf}, the data
component is a 1-dimensional array of real type with 856 elements.  It
can have up to seven dimensions.  It is particularly referenced via
parameter names IN, OUT, and NDF.

\label{apndf:title}
\item[{\bf TITLE}] -- the  character string {\tt "HR6259 - AAT fibre
data"} describes the contents of the NDF.  The NDF's TITLE might be
used as the title of a graph {\it etc.}\ It may be set with task
\htmlref{SETTITLE}{SETTITLE}.  Applications that create an NDF assign
a TITLE to the NDF via a parameter, called TITLE unless the
application generates several NDFs.

\label{apndf:label}
\item[{\bf LABEL}] -- the character string {\tt "Flux"} describes the
quantity represented in the NDF's main data array.  The LABEL is
intended for use on the axis of graphs {\it etc.}\  It may be set
using the task \htmlref{SETLABEL}{SETLABEL}.

\label{apndf:units}
\item[{\bf UNITS}] -- this character string describes the physical units
of the quantity stored in the main data array, in this case,
{\tt "Counts/s"}.  It may be set via the command
\htmlref{SETUNITS}{SETUNITS}.  

\label{apndf:quality}
\item[{\bf QUALITY}] -- this component is used to indicate the quality
of each element in the main data array, for example whether each pixel
is vignetted or not.  The quality structure contains a quality array
and a BADBITS value, both of which {\em must\/} be of type
\htmlref{\_UBYTE}{ap:HDStypes}.  The quality array has the same shape
and size as the main data array and is used in conjunction with the
BADBITS value to decide the quality of a pixel in the main data array.
In {\tt example.sdf} the BADBITS component has value 1.  This means
that a value of 1 in the quality array indicates a bad pixel in the
main data array, whereas any other value indicates that the associated
pixel is good.  (Note that the pixel is bad if the bit-wise comparison
QUALITY {\tt{"}}AND{\tt{"}} BADBITS is non-zero).  The meanings of the
QUALITY bits are arbitrary.  See the command \htmlref{SETBB}{SETBB}.
To enter new quality information, use the SETQUAL command of \IRASref\@.

\label{apndf:variance}
\item[{\bf VARIANCE}] -- the variance array is the same shape and size
as the main data array and contains the errors associated with the
individual data values.  These are stored as {\em variance\/}
estimates for each pixel.  VARIANCE may be set with the
\htmlref{SETVAR}{SETVAR} command.

\label{apndf:axis}
\item[{\bf AXIS}] -- the AXIS structure may contain axis information for
any dimension of the NDF's main array.  In this case, the main data
array is only 1-dimensional, therefore only the AXIS(1) structure is
present.  This structure contains the actual axis data array of pixel
centres, and also label and units information.  {\footnotesize KAPPA} uses the
label and units for axis annotations.  Not shown in this example
are optional array components for storing pixel widths and the variance
of the axis centres.  All axes or none must be present.  Use 
\htmlref{SETAXIS}{SETAXIS} to set the values of an AXIS array component;
\htmlref{AXLABEL}{AXLABEL} and \htmlref{AXUNITS}{AXUNITS} to set an
axis LABEL or UNITS component; and \htmlref{SETNORM}{SETNORM} to set
an axis normalisation flag.

\label{apndf:wcs}
\item[{\bf WCS}] -- this component provides an alternative, and superior,
method for storing co-ordinate information. The AXIS structure described
above has the severe limitation that it can only describe co-ordinate
systems in which all axes are independant ({\it{i.e.}}\ the value on
any axis can be changed without needing to change the values on any 
other axes). This means for instance that axes cannot be rotated (other
than by multiples of 90\dgs), and cannot be used to describe celestial
co-ordinates over a large field, or near a pole. The WCS component
overcomes these restrictions. It contains descriptions of an arbitrary
number of different co-ordinate Frames, together with the mappings
required to convert positions between these Frames. All NDFs have three
default Frames available; these are known as the GRID, PIXEL and AXIS
Frames. The PIXEL Frame corresponds to pixel co-ordinates. The AXIS
Frame corresponds to the co-ordinate Frame implied by the NDF AXIS 
structures. The GRID Frame is similar to the PIXEL Frame, the main
difference being that it has a different origin; the centre of the first 
(``bottom left'') pixel is always $(1.0,1.0)$ in the GRID Frame regardless 
of the pixel origin of the NDF. Other Frames can be added to the WCS
component in various ways, for instance, by importing them from
appropriate FIST headers (\htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN},
\htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN}), or using an appropriate application to 
create them from scratch (eg \htmlref{WCSADD}{WCSADD},
\htmlref{SETSKY}{SETSKY} or \GAIAref\ ).

\label{apndf:history}
\item[{\bf HISTORY}] -- this component provides a record of the
processing history of the NDF.  Only the first of three records is
shown for {\tt example.sdf}.  This indicates that the spectrum was
extracted from fibre data using the {\footnotesize FIGARO} FINDSP command on
1990 December 19. The history recording level is set by task 
\htmlref{HISSET}{HISSET}.  This task also allows you to switch off
history recording or delete the history records.
\htmlref{HISLIST}{HISLIST} lists an NDF's history.  You can add
commentary with \htmlref{HISCOM}{HISCOM}.

\label{apndf:extensions}
\item[{\bf EXTENSIONs}] -- the purpose of extensions is to store
non-standard items.  These auxiliary data could be information about
the original observing setup, such as the airmass during the
observation or the temperature of the detector; they may be
calibration data or results produced during processing of the data
array, {\it{e.g.}}\ spectral-line fits. {\tt example.sdf} began life as
a \Figaroref\ file.  It was converted to an NDF using the command
\xref{DST2NDF}{sun55}{DST2NDF}\latexonly{ (see SUN/55)}.  It contains
values for the airmass and exposure time associated with the
observations.  These are stored in the FIGARO extension, and the
intention is that the {\footnotesize FIGARO} applications which use these
values will know where to find them.  Task \htmlref{SETEXT}{SETEXT}
lets the contents of extensions be listed, created, deleted, renamed
and assigned new values.

One extension that is used by {\footnotesize KAPPA} is the
\htmlref{FITS extension}{se:fitsairlock}.  This holds the FITS headers
as an array of 80-character elements, {\it{i.e.}}\ one FITS card image
per array element.  You can extract the values of ancillary items from
the FITS extension to a non-standard extension via
\htmlref{FITSIMP}{FITSIMP}.  Use \htmlref{FITSEXP}{FITSEXP} to do the
reverse operation.  The extension can be listed via the command
\htmlref{FITSLIST}{FITSLIST}.  \htmlref{FITSEDIT}{FITSEDIT} allows you
to edit the headers prior to export of the dataset to another format
such as \FITSref\ or \IRAFref\@.

\end{description}

\newpage
\section{\xlabel{ap_IMAGEformat}IMAGE data format\label{ap:IMAGEformat}}

The IMAGE format as used by some commands in earlier versions of
{\footnotesize KAPPA} is a simple
\HDSref\ structure, comprising a floating-point data array, a character title,
and the maximum and minimum data values.  It is variant of the
original Wright-Giddings IMAGE structure.  There are others is use
that contain more items. An example structure is shown schematically
below using the \HDSTRACEref\latexonly{ (SUN/102)} notation; see
\latexelsehtml{Appendix~\ref{ap:NDFformat}}{\htmlref{the NDF format}{ap:NDFformat}}.
\begin{verbatim}
   HORSEHEAD  <IMAGE>

      DATA_ARRAY(384,512)  <_REAL>   100.5,102.6,110.1,109.8,105.3,107.6,
                                     ... 123.1,117.3,119,120.5,127.3,108.4
      TITLE          <_CHAR*72>      'KAPPA - Flip'
      DATA_MIN       <_REAL>         28.513
      DATA_MAX       <_REAL>         255.94

   End of Trace.
\end{verbatim}

The DATA\_ARRAY may have up to seven dimensions.
IMAGE structures are associated with parameters like INPIC and OUTPIC.
The TITLE object of new IMAGE structures takes the value of the
parameter OTITLE.  DATA\_MIN and DATA\_MAX are now ignored.

The IMAGE format is not too dissimilar from a {\em primitive\/} NDF
with no extensions.  Indeed if it did not have DATA\_MAX and DATA\_MIN
it would be a {\it bona fide}\ NDF.  Thus applications that handle the
IMAGE format can follow the rules of \xref{SGP/38}{sgp38}{} and
process it like an NDF.  In effect this means that all extensions are
propagated to output files, and a quality array is propagated where
the processing does not invalidate its values.  IMAGE applications
also handle most {\em simple\/} NDFs correctly (those where the data
array is an array of numbers at the second level of the hierarchical
structure).  This similarity in formats enables NDF and IMAGE
applications to work in co-operation, and so the conversion within
{\footnotesize KAPPA} was undertaken piecemeal over several years. 
Note that the primitive
variant is no longer the norm for NDFs, since for example, it does not
support origin information.

\section{\xlabel{ap_HDStypes}Supported HDS Data Types\label{ap:HDStypes}}

{\footnotesize KAPPA} applications can process \NDFref{NDFs}\ in one or more of the
following \HDSref\ data types.  The correspondence between Fortran types
and HDS data types is as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|} \hline
{\bf HDS Type} & {\bf Number of bytes} & {\bf FORTRAN Type}\\ \hline
\_DOUBLE & 8 & DOUBLE PRECISION \\
\_INTEGER & 4 & INTEGER \\
\_REAL & 8 & REAL \\
\_UBYTE & 1 & BYTE \\
\_BYTE & 1 & BYTE \\
\_UWORD & 2 & INTEGER*2 \\
\_WORD & 2 & INTEGER*2\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

(\_UBYTE) and (\_UWORD) types are unsigned and so permit data ranges of
0--255 and 0--65535 respectively.

\section{Release Notes---V0.8-5}

\subsection{Global changes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item  All the graphics modules are linked shareably with AGI, thus any
    bug fixes in AGI can be applied without relinking KAPPA.
 
  \item  Applications using axis data will now detect if the axis centres
    are not monotonic, and then take appropriate action, {\it{e.g.}}
    DISPLAY would use world co-ordinates for axes, and NDFTRACE
    would flag the axis as being non-monotonic.

  \item  Typographical errors in the online documentation are corrected.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{New applications}

Although only an incremental release, the following applications
have been made available because they are simple to use, and AXCONV
is needed urgently.

\begin{description}

  \item [\htmlref{AXCONV}{AXCONV}] Expands spaced axes in an NDF into the primitive form.
    (This is to enable certain \ASTERIXref\ files to be useable in
    {\footnotesize KAPPA}).

  \item [\htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN}]  The disc-FITS reader is now available on UNIX
     platforms.

  \item [\htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN}]  The FITS reader is now available on UNIX platforms.

  \item [\htmlref{MEM2D}{MEM2D}]  The maximum-entropy deconvolution application is
     available under SunOS.

  \item [\htmlref{NOGLOBALS}{NOGLOBALS}]  Resets the KAPPA global parameters.

  \item [\htmlref{OVCLEAR}{OVCLEAR}]  Clears the current image-overlay device (without
    purging the graphics database), with an option to clear just the
    current picture.

\end{description}

\subsection{Modified applications}
\begin{itemize}
  \item  CLEANER writes the bad-pixel flag.

  \item  \htmlref{CONTOUR}{CONTOUR}, \htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY},
    \htmlref{GREYPLOT}{GREYPLOT}, \htmlref{TURBOCONT}{TURBOCONT}
    each has a new FILL parameter that permits the maximum-sized
    plots, ignoring any restriction on square pixels.  It is useful
    for displaying images with markedly different dimensions, such as
    spectra.  FILL defaults to {\tt FALSE}.

  \item  CONTOUR and TURBOCONT each has a new BORDER parameter that
    defaults to {\tt TRUE}.  When it and parameter AXES are both
    {\tt FALSE}, no border is drawn around the contour plot.

  \item  DISPLAY and GREYPLOT pass the linear scaling limits to global
    parameters that \linebreak LUTVIEW now uses by default.  (Note that
    this is a temporary arrangement, since a means to pass non-linear
    scalings is planned.) 

  \item  GAUSS permits arbitrarily oriented elliptical Gaussian
    smoothing kernels, though the default still produces a
    circularly symmetric filter.

  \item  \htmlref{INSPECT}{INSPECT} uses the existing palette for
    its annotations in cursor mode.

  \item  \htmlref{MLINPLOT}{MLINPLOT} has a KEY parameter so that the
    key may be removed.  It is defaulted to {\tt TRUE}, giving the
    previous behaviour.

  \item  \htmlref{PALENTRY}{PALENTRY} works for X-window overlays, so
    that it is now possible to alter the foreground colour of the overlay. 

  \item  \htmlref{PICLIST}{PICLIST} indicates the current picture.

  \item  \htmlref{SNAPSHOT}{SNAPSHOT} parameter ODEVICE suggested default is the current
    value of the parameter.  There is a new defaulted parameter
    PLANES that enables snapshots of just the base or the overlay
    for X-windows.  The default behaviour is to capture all planes,
    as happened prior to this version.

  \item  \htmlref{SURFIT}{SURFIT} has more constraints to prevent problems with small
    arrays.  It obtains the value of ESTIMATOR after the number of
    values in a bin is known, its default becomes the median when
    the bins comprise less than 12 pixels.

\section{Release Notes---V0.9}

The main features of this release are 39 new tasks, 6 new synonym
commands for easier use, 15 applications converted to use NDFs, numerous
enhancements to existing facilities, and updated documentation for UNIX
and hypertext.

\subsection{Global changes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item  There is no longer support for VMS.
  
  \item  The KAPPA monolith has been fragmented.  It now comprises three
    monoliths: KAPVIEW for the graphics tasks; NDFPACK for the NDF and
    HDS-object manipulations; and KAPPA itself for the remainder (mostly
    image-processing tasks).  All are linked statically for efficiency
    and ease of export.

  \item In addition to describing new and revised commands in the
    Appendices, the documentation has been greatly expanded featuring
    more examples and tutorials; new sections on C-shell scripts, NDF
    history, masking, the FITS airlock, composite hardcopy plots, and
    various aspects of parameters including a summary of usage; and
    numerous improved sections and figures.  VMS references have been
    removed.  Many of the examples show usage from the shell,
    including how to escape metacharacters.  The reference section has
    been standardised for the non-IMAGE tasks.  This includes Usage
    and Examples sections with lowercase invocations, a
    more-consistent notation, and a Related Applications section.
    Applications released in version 0.8-4U are documented in paper
    form for the first time. Several typographical and editing errors
    have been corrected in the documentation.

  \item There is hypertext documentation based upon this SUN.  It
  includes links to other documents and more graphics.

  \item  KAPHELP and its navigational aids work from within \ICLref\@.

  \item  There are improved instructions for cursor interactions,
    including using the mouse for X-window devices.

  \item  There is more-efficient workspace management scheme available
    in most tasks where work arrays are needed.

  \item  COMP parameters that obtain array components, now support a
    value of {\tt "Error"} to use the square root of the variance.

  \item  The TITLE parameters largely default to null, so that an
    output NDF inherits the title of the input NDF.  Previously, the
    TITLE defaulted to {\tt "KAPPA - }{\it $<$task$>$}{\tt{"}}.

  \item  An improved algorithm is used to test whether axes are linear
    or not.

  \item  The bad-pixel flag is now updated throughout {\footnotesize KAPPA}.
    Previously, it had been commented out so that it would not cause
    problems with the IMAGE-format tasks.

  \item  A dot in the foreground colour that could appear at 
    co-ordinate (0,0) in plots with axes has been removed.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{New applications}
\begin{description}
  \item [\htmlref{ARDGEN}{ARDGEN}]  Creates a text file which describes
    selected regions of a previously displayed image.  The file is
    in the ARD format.  There are eleven shapes, and 5 logical
    operators for combining regions.  There are options, amongst others,
    for listing and deleting regions .

  \item [\htmlref{ARDMASK}{ARDMASK}]  Uses an ARD file, such as created
    by ARDGEN, to define regions of an NDF to mask.  It therefore
    allows regions to be excluded from subsequent data processing.

  \item [\htmlref{AXLABEL}{AXLABEL}]  Sets a new label component for an
    NDF axis.

  \item [\htmlref{AXUNITS}{AXUNITS}]  Sets a new units component for an
    NDF axis.

  \item [\htmlref{CALC}{CALC}]  Evaluates a Fortran-like mathematical
    expression.  This is particularly useful for non-integer
    arithmetic in C-shell scripts.  Parameters and sub-expressions are
    supported.

  \item [\htmlref{CALPOL}{CALPOL}]  Calculates various polarisation
    parameters from four NDFs containing intensity arrays analysed at
    0\dgs, 45\dgs, 90\dgs, and 135\dgs\ from a reference direction.
    The resultant parameters are stored in NDFs, of which there are
    eight possible.

  \item [\htmlref{CONVOLVE}{CONVOLVE}]  Convolves a 1- or 2-dimensional
    NDF using a function given by a second NDF.  The latter is
    normally a point-spread function, and need not have the same
    dimensions as the convolved NDF.

  \item [\htmlref{ELPROF}{ELPROF}]  Creates a radial or azimuthal
    profile of a 2-dimensional NDF.  It bins the image into elliptical
    annuli or a fan-shaped region of adjacent sectors.  The mean
    values in each bin are stored in a 1-dimensional output NDF.
    There are options to restrict the range of radial distance and
    azimuthal angle.

  \item [\htmlref{ERRCLIP}{ERRCLIP}]  Removes pixels with errors larger
    than some limit from an NDF by flagging them with the bad value in
    a copy NDF.

  \item [\htmlref{FILLBAD}{FILLBAD}]  Removes regions of bad values
    from a 2-dimensional NDF using a smooth function which matches the
    surrounding data.

  \item [\htmlref{FITSEXP}{FITSEXP}]  Moves ancillary data within an
    NDF from arbitrary extensions to the FITS extension.  It uses a
    keyword translation table held in a text file.

  \item [\htmlref{FITSTEXT}{FITSTEXT}]  Creates an NDF FITS extension
   from a text file.  There is limited validation of the headers.

  \item [\htmlref{FITSURFACE}{FITSURFACE}]  Fits a polynomial surface
    to 2-dimensional NDF.  It does not bin the data and does not reject
    outliers to the fit. It stores the result within a POLYNOMIAL data
    structure called SURFACEFIT within the fitted NDF.

  \item [\htmlref{HISCOM}{HISCOM}]  Adds commentary to the history
    records of an NDF.  The text can be supplied through a parameter, or
    a text file.  There is optional control of paragraph wrapping.

  \item [\htmlref{HISLIST}{HISLIST}]  Lists all the history records in
    an NDF.  The output comprises the date, time, and application name, and
    optionally the history text.

  \item [\htmlref{HISSET}{HISSET}]  Sets the history update mode for
    an NDF.  History recording disabled, or set to record at three
    levels of verbosity.  Existing history records can also be deleted.

  \item [\htmlref{LUCY}{LUCY}]  Performs a Lucy-Richardson deconvolution
    of a 1- or 2-dimensional NDF with a point-spread function.  It uses an
    iterative process to provide new estimates of the restored,
    higher-resolution array.  The closeness of the fit is determined
    by the $\chi^2$ per pixel.  The algorithm terminates
    after a specified number of iterations or when a certain
    $\chi^2$ has been reached.  The Synder correction may be applied
    using the data variance.

  \item [\htmlref{MAKESURFACE}{MAKESURFACE}]  Creates a 2-dimensional NDF
    from the coefficients of a polynomial surface stored in a SURFACEFIT
    extension (as written by FITSURFACE).  The size and extent of the
    output NDF may be defined by a template NDF.

  \item [\htmlref{PARGET}{PARGET}]  Obtains the value or values of an
    application parameter.  This offers an easier way to pass parameter
    values between tasks in shell scripts.

  \item [\htmlref{PASTE}{PASTE}]  Pastes a series of NDFs upon each
    other.  Bad values may be transparent or opaque.  The NDFs need not
    be congruent or even have the same number of dimensions.

  \item [\htmlref{PICCUR}{PICCUR}]  Uses a cursor to select the current
    picture and to report the co-ordinates of points.  Some of the
    functions of CURSOR have been moved to this task.

  \item [\htmlref{PICEMPTY}{PICEMPTY}]  Finds the first empty FRAME
    picture in the \htmlref{graphics database}{se:agitate}.  This is
    most useful with PICGRID to fill in a grid of FRAME pictures
    without having to know or compute their labels.

  \item [\htmlref{PICENTIRE}{PICENTIRE}]  Finds the first unobscured
    and unobscuring FRAME picture in the graphics database.  This tries
    to locate a FRAME picture such that additional plotting within it
    will not affect earlier plots.

  \item [\htmlref{PICTRANS}{PICTRANS}]  Transforms co-ordinates between
    the current and BASE pictures of the graphics database.

  \item [\htmlref{PICVIS}{PICVIS}]  Finds the first unobscured FRAME
    picture in the graphics database.

  \item [\htmlref{RIFT}{RIFT}]  Adds a constant to a sub-section of an
    NDF to correct rift-valley defects.

  \item [\htmlref{SETAXIS}{SETAXIS}]  Sets the values for an axis array
    component of an NDF.  There are several options which permit the
    deletion of the axis system, or an individual variance or width
    array; the replacement of one or more individual values; the
    assignment of the whole array using a Fortran-like mathematical
    expression, or from a text file, or set to pixel co-ordinates.

  \item [\htmlref{SETEXT}{SETEXT}]  Manipulates the contents of a
    specified NDF extension. There are six options including erasure,
    renaming, and assignment of extension components.

  \item [\htmlref{SETNORM}{SETNORM}]  Sets one or more of the
    axis-normalisation flags in an NDF.

  \item [\htmlref{SETSKY}{SETSKY}]  Makes an IRAS astrometry extension
    for a 2-dimensional NDF, thereby allowing sky co-ordinate
    information to be stored with an arbitrary image.  The co-ordinate
    system can be defined by suppling explicit projection parameters, or
    by providing a list of sky and corresponding image co-ordinates, or
    a combination of both. This task enables non-IRAS data to use the
    SKY$\lsk$ tasks in the \IRASref\ package which perform
    various astrometric tasks such as plotting axes and overlay grids in
    sky co-ordinates.

  \item [\htmlref{TRANINVERT}{TRANINVERT}]  Inverts a transformation
   stored in a \xref{TRANSFORM}{sun61}{} structure within an existing HDS file.

  \item [\htmlref{TRANJOIN}{TRANJOIN}]  Joins two transformation stored
    in the TRANSFORM format.

  \item [\htmlref{TRANMAKE}{TRANMAKE}]  Makes a transformation structure
    from supplied forward and inverse mappings.  The structure can
    have classification qualifiers and a comment.  The mappings are
    defined using Fortran-like expressions, and may include
    sub-expressions and constants.  There are also preset
    2-dimensional transformations: polar about a supplied origin, and
    the six-term linear which encompasses shift of origin, rotation,
    magnification, and shear.

  \item [\htmlref{TRANSFORMER}{TRANSFORMER}]  Applies a transformation
    stored in TRANSFORM structure to an NDF by resampling.  There is
    full control of the shape, origin, and co-ordinate limits of the
    transformed NDF.  The resampling use either linear interpolation or
    the nearest-neighbour method.

  \item [\htmlref{TRANTRACE}{TRANTRACE}]  Lists the contents of a
    TRANSFORM structure.

  \item [\htmlref{VECPLOT}{VECPLOT}]  Plots a 2-dimensional vector map
    of an NDF.  The vectors may be arrows or lines, and there is
    control of the frequency, justification, and scaling of the
    vectors.  There is an optional key, and many parameters for
    customising the appearance of the plot.

  \item [\htmlref{WIENER}{WIENER}]  Applies a Wiener filter to a 1- or 2-dimensional
    array.  It offers a much faster, but cruder, deconvolution method.
    This task uses a `white' noise model or a power spectrum supplied
    in another NDF.  The noise power is adjustable.
\end{description}

\subsection{New synonyms}
\begin{description}
  \item [\htmlref{PICBASE}{PICBASE}]  Selects the BASE picture from the
    \htmlref{graphics database}{se:agitate}.

  \item [\htmlref{PICDATA}{PICDATA}]  Selects the last DATA picture
    from the graphics database.

  \item [\htmlref{PICFRAME}{PICFRAME}]  Selects the last FRAME picture
    from the graphics database.

  \item [\htmlref{PICGRID}{PICGRID}]  Creates an array of FRAME
    pictures in the graphics database.

  \item [\htmlref{PICLAST}{PICLAST}]  Selects the last picture from the
    graphics database.

  \item [\htmlref{PICXY}{PICXY}] Creates a new FRAME picture defined
    by co-ordinate bounds.
\end{description}

\subsection{New procedures}
\begin{description}
  \item [\htmlref{FITSEDIT}{FITSEDIT}]  Edits the FITS extension of an
    NDF.  You can use your favourite editor to modify the FITS headers
    in a NDF's \htmlref{FITS extension}{se:fitsairlock}.  There is
    limited validation of the edited headers.

  \item [\htmlref{FITSHEAD}{FITSHEAD}]  Lists the primary and extension
    headers of a list of FITS files or a range of FITS files on tape.
\end{description}

\subsection{Withdrawn and renamed applications}

  The following applications have been withdrawn at V0.9.
  \begin{description}
  \item [COMPRESS]  The NDF\_ version of \htmlref{COMPAVE}{COMPAVE}
     provides COMPRESS's functionality.
  \item [NUMBA]  The NDF\_ version of \htmlref{NUMB}{NUMB} provides
     NUMBA's functionality.
  \item [PICK2D]  \htmlref{NDFCOPY}{NDFCOPY} or
     \htmlref{SETBOUND}{SETBOUND} provides the functionality in $n$-d.
  \item [STATS2D]  Use \htmlref{STATS}{STATS} with \latexonly{NDF
     sectioning (see SUN/33.3 Section 16 or Section~\ref{se:ndfsect})}
     \htmlref{NDF sectioning}{se:ndfsect}
     replaces the capability of STATS2D.
  \item [THRESH0]  The THRESH0 operation can easily be performed
     by \htmlref{THRESH}{THRESH}.
  \item [TWEAK]  Use \htmlref{LUTTWEAK}{LUTTWEAK}.
  \end{description}

  To prevent command-name clashes with \Figaroref\ and C-shell
  built-in functions three applications are renamed.  GAUSS has
  become \htmlref{GAUSMOOTH}{GAUSMOOTH}, CLEANER reverts to
  \htmlref{FFCLEAN}{FFCLEAN}, and SHIFT becomes \htmlref{SLIDE}{SLIDE}.

\subsection{Deprecated features}

  The following commands, which do not work for X-window devices,
  will be withdrawn at V0.10.
  \begin{description}
  \item [BLINK]  We hope to provide this facility for X-windows through
    a graphical-user-interface (GUI) image-processing tool.
  \item [IDUNZOOM]  Full control of zoom and unzooming should be a
    feature of the planned GUI tool.
  \item [IDVISIBLE]  This functionality might be part of the planned
    GUI.
  \end{description}

\subsection{Modified applications}  

Here is a summary of the main modifications.  All those converted to use
the NDF\_ library feature much-improved documentation.
\begin{itemize}
  \item  The accuracy of \htmlref{APERADD}{APERADD} has been improved
    by using pixel co-ordinates rather than indices.  There is a warning
    in the documentation concerning its limited algorithm and accuracy.

  \item  \htmlref{BLOCK}{BLOCK} permits smoothing of 1-dimensional
    \NDFref{NDFs}.  There is an ESTIMATOR parameter for forming the
    output values.  At present it may select the mean or median of the
    neighbourhood.  There is no restriction on maximum box size.

  \item  \htmlref{CHPIX}{CHPIX} has been converted to use NDF\_, and works
    in $n$ dimensions.  Sections as well as individual pixels may be
    edited in any of the NDF array components.

  \item  COLUMNAR and HIDE have a THRESH parameter to set lower and upper
    data values to appear in the plot.

  \item  \htmlref{COMPADD}{COMPADD}, \htmlref{COMPAVE}{COMPAVE}, and
    \htmlref{COMPICK}{COMPICK} now use NDF\_ and operate on
    $n$-dimensional NDFs.  They can have different compression factors
    along each axis.  COMPADD and COMPAVE have the WLIM parameter for
    deciding whether each output pixel is good or bad, and permit
    weighting using the variance information of the input NDF.

  \item \htmlref{CONTOVER}{CONTOVER} works with MATRIX\_PRINTER class
    devices so can be used to generate composite hardcopy plots.

  \item  \htmlref{CURSOR}{CURSOR} no longer changes the current picture
    in the graphics database.  The chosen points may be marked with
    crosses or joined by polygon lines in a nominated colour.  Points
    are also erasable.  The final set of co-ordinates and the number
    of points are written to output parameters XP, YP, and NUMBER
    respectively.

  \item  \htmlref{FFCLEAN}{FFCLEAN} (formerly CLEANER) can filter
   1-dimensional NDFs.

  \item  A bug in \htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN} and
    \htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN}, where BITPIX=8 FITS data would generate
    a \_BYTE type data array instead of the correct
    \htmlref{\_UBYTE}{ap:HDStypes} type, has been cured.  FITSIN no
    longer rewinds the tape before reading it.  The suggested default
    for parameter FMTCNV in both FITSIN and FITSDIN has been changed
    from {\tt FALSE} to {\tt TRUE}.

  \item  \htmlref{FOURIER}{FOURIER} no longer uses NAG and calls the
    FFTPACK routines of the \PDAref\ library.  As a result it is slightly
    faster, and is now available on all supported systems.  It can now
    operate upon 1-dimensional NDFs too.

  \item  \htmlref{GAUSMOOTH}{GAUSMOOTH} (formerly GAUSS) will now
    smooth 1-dimensional NDFs.

  \item  When reading from a text file, \htmlref{GLITCH}{GLITCH}
    interprets integer positions as pixel indices, and floating-point
    positions as pixel co-ordinates.

  \item  \htmlref{GLOBALS}{GLOBALS} reports the current transformation
    structure.

  \item  \htmlref{HISTAT}{HISTAT} has been converted to NDF\_.  It
    supports all NDF array components, and operates on NDFs of
    arbitrary dimensionality.

  \item  \htmlref{HISTEQ}{HISTEQ} has been converted to NDF\_.  It
    operates on NDFs of arbitrary dimensionality.

  \item  \htmlref{HISTOGRAM}{HISTOGRAM} has been converted to NDF\_.  It
    supports all NDF array components, and operates on NDFs of
    arbitrary dimensionality.  The histogram may be saved to an NDF
    (with the bad-pixel flag set to {\tt FALSE}); and/or plotted, with
    several parameters available for controlling the appearance of the
    graphics.

  \item  In \htmlref{INSPECT}{INSPECT} the defaults for parameters
    HISTOGRAM and SLICE have changed to null, meaning do not produce
    an output NDF.  Cursor mode using a workstation or X-terminal is
    fully controllable using the mouse buttons; pressing the mouse
    middle button allows sampling of the region or slice, or erasure
    of points in the {\tt XYcur} mode.

  \item  \htmlref{LUTABLE}{LUTABLE} requires fewer required pens (8 if
    FULL={\tt TRUE} or 24 if FULL={\tt FALSE}).  Works directly on
    double-precision NDFs for the histogram equalisation.

  \item  \htmlref{LUTHILITE}{LUTHILITE}, \htmlref{LUTROT}{LUTROT},
    \htmlref{LUTTWEAK}{LUTTWEAK} have a FULL parameter to allow
    manipulation of the full colour table.

  \item  \htmlref{LUTSAVE}{LUTSAVE} now creates NDF with data array
    having the simple variant, and the bad-pixel flag set to {\tt FALSE}. 

  \item  \htmlref{LUTVIEW}{LUTVIEW} has new NN and LUT parameters, to
    read in a lookup table NDF into the colour table.

  \item  \htmlref{MATHS}{MATHS} supports tokens for pixel and data
     co-ordinates, and so can generate test data of virtually
     arbitrary functions.  When there are no input NDFs, the bounds of
     the output NDF is controlled either by parameters or a template
     NDF.  There are also new tokens for variance and sub-expressions.

  \item  \htmlref{MEDIAN}{MEDIAN} has been converted to NDF\_.

  \item  \htmlref{MEM2D}{MEM2D} no longer uses NAG and calls the
     FFTPACK routines of the PDA library.  As a result it is slightly
     faster, and is now available on all supported systems.  The 
     limitation on the array size has been relaxed.

  \item  \htmlref{NDFTRACE}{NDFTRACE} has 28 output parameters.  There
     is now also a QUIET flag to suppress output for procedures.

  \item  \htmlref{NOGLOBALS}{NOGLOBALS} erases the current transformation
    structure.

  \item  \htmlref{NOMAGIC}{NOMAGIC} has been converted to NDF\_.  There
    is a new SIGMA parameter, to allow the replacement values to be
    replaced with random numbers of a Gaussian distribution about the
    replacement value.  All array components may be processed.

  \item \htmlref{NUMB}{NUMB} has been converted to NDF\_.  All array
    components may be processed.  There are new parameters ABS and
    ABOVE.  {\tt NUMB ABS} is equivalent to the defunct NUMBA: it finds the
    number of pixels whose absolute value exceeds or is less than a
    threshold.  The ABOVE parameter controls the sense of the comparison.

  \item  \htmlref{PALENTRY}{PALENTRY} and \htmlref{PALDEF}{PALDEF}
    permit the DEVICE to be of class MATRIX\_PRINTER and have the
    reset attribute.  In other words you can call these for output to
    coloured PostScript.

  \item  \htmlref{PICDEF}{PICDEF} has an ASPECT parameter for
    controlling the aspect ratio of pictures defined by the TBC and
    LRC positioning modes. Parameter FRACTION can have different
    values for the two axes. The order of the positional parameters
    has changed: DEVICE and CURRENT were removed, XPIC and YPIC were
    added at positions 3 and 4, and LBOUND and UBOUND at positions 5
    and 6.  These modifications were needed to make
    \htmlref{PICGRID}{PICGRID} and \htmlref{PICXY}{PICXY} work.

  \item  \htmlref{PICIN}{PICIN} writes the bounds of the picture in
    raster co-ordinates to parameters RCX1, RCX2, RCY1, and RCY2.

  \item  \htmlref{PICLABEL}{PICLABEL} documentation explains what
    happens if the new label already exists in the database.

  \item  \htmlref{PICLIST}{PICLIST} does not report the list of pictures when
    a value for parameter PICNUM is supplied on the command line.
    PICNUM may take the value {\tt "Last"} to select the last picture
    in the graphics database.

  \item  \htmlref{PIXDUPE}{PIXDUPE} has been converted to NDF\_.  It
    operates on NDFs of arbitrary dimensions.  The expansion factors
    may be different along each axis.

  \item  \htmlref{PSF}{PSF} allows greater control of the plotting
    style, including the option to plot along the major axis of an
    elliptical point-spread function, and scaling of the abscissa from
    pixels to physical units.  It now aborts correctly at a prompt for
    the POSCOLS parameter, and computes the correct dimensions for the
    output point-spread function NDF.

  \item  \htmlref{ROTATE}{ROTATE} has been converted to NDF\_.
    Variance and quality information may be rotated.

  \item  \htmlref{SEGMENT}{SEGMENT} has been converted to NDF\_.  The
    $x$-$y$ positions may be specified through parameters, from a text
    file, and by using the graphics cursor.  The chosen points may be
    marked with crosses, or connected with polygon lines in a
    nominated colour.  Variance and quality information may be copied.
    The number of polygons can be constrained between limits.

  \item  \htmlref{SETMAGIC}{SETMAGIC} has been converted to NDF\_.  All
    array components may be processed.

  \item  \htmlref{SHADOW}{SHADOW} has been converted to NDF\_.  The
  shifts have been combined into a single SHIFT parameter

  \item  \htmlref{THRESH}{THRESH} has been converted to the NDF\_.  All
    array components may be processed.

  \item  \htmlref{TRANDAT}{TRANDAT} has a new parameter LBOUND for
    setting the array lower bounds in automatic mode.  The created NDF
    uses the simple variant for the data array.
\end{itemize}

\section{Release Notes---V0.10}
This release includes four new applications, three new synonyms, and
enhancements to existing applications.  Five applications have been
withdrawn, two to enable {\footnotesize KAPPA} to be NAG-free.

\subsection{Global changes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item  The NAG library is no longer used, and thus {\footnotesize
    KAPPA} is available via the Starlink Software Store.
 
  \item  Standardized the implementation status in the reference section,
    and corrected the HISTORY processing.

  \item  Improved the documentation: clarified and reduced the usage of
    the term ``magic pixel''; added more warnings about metacharacters in
    C-shell usage; updated the related applications; extended the FITS
    airlock to include the new editing commands; added a new section
    on bad-pixel removal; and corrected various typographical errors,
    mostly in the reference section.

  \item  The reference dataset in the AGI database may be a foreign file
    and/or include an NDF section.

  \item Several tasks use a faster method of managing workspace.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{New applications}
\begin{description}

  \item [\htmlref{DRAWSIG}{DRAWSIG}] 
     Draws ${\pm}n$ standard-deviation lines on a line plot.  There is
     clipping, and the statistics may be reported too.  It is
     expected to be used in conjunction with LINPLOT or HISTOGRAM.

  \item [\htmlref{FITSMOD}{FITSMOD}]  
     Edits an NDF FITS extension via a text file or parameters.  This
     allows you to manipulate ancillary data not in a special extension.

  \item [\htmlref{KSTEST}{KSTEST}]
     Compares datasets against a reference dataset using the 
     Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and combines statistically similar data
     into an output vector dataset.  You can supply a single dataset,
     which is divided for the comparisons.

  \item [\htmlref{SUBSTITUTE}{SUBSTITUTE}] 
     Replaces all occurrences of a given value in an NDF array with
     another value.

\end{description}

\subsection{New synonyms}
\begin{description}

  \item [\htmlref{FITSEXIST}{FITSEXIST}]
     Inquires whether or not a keyword exists in an NDF's FITS extension.
     It is intended for scripts.

  \item [\htmlref{FITSVAL}{FITSVAL}]
     Reports the value of a keyword in the FITS extension.

  \item [\htmlref{FITSWRITE}{FITSWRITE}]
     Writes a new keyword and optional comment to the FITS extension.

\end{description}

\subsection{Withdrawn applications}
\begin{description}

   \item [BLINK]
     Does not work with X-windows.  Use \GAIAref\@.

   \item [COLUMNAR]
     No suitable public-domain equivalent plotting could be found to
     replace the NAG graphics.  This command may reappear if an
     adequate replacement subroutine can be located.

   \item [HIDE]
     See COLUMNAR.

   \item [IDUNZOOM]
     Does not work with X-windows.  Use \GAIAref\@.

   \item [IDVISIBLE]
     Does not work with X-windows.

\end{description}

\subsection{Modified applications}
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Examples added to \htmlref{CHPIX}{CHPIX} documentation.

  \item  \htmlref{CONTOVER}{CONTOVER}, \htmlref{CONTOUR}{CONTOUR},
    and \htmlref{TURBOCONT}{TURBOCONT} have had several improvements.  There are
    two new methods for selecting the contour heights using percentiles
    (MODE={\tt "Equalised"} and {\tt "Percentiles"}).  There is a CONCOL parameter
    for selecting the colour of the contours.  Dashed contours may be
    plotted for those with heights below the value of a new DASHED
    parameter.  There is a new THICK parameter for CONTOVER akin to
    those in other tasks.  The maximum thickness has been increased to
    10.  The tessellation size has been increased to 512 pixels for
    CONTOVER and TURBOCONT.  There are new examples.

  \item  The smoothed contouring and annotation facilities in CONTOUR
    have been withdrawn, possibly temporarily, as they called NAG
    graphics routines.  Thus parameters ANNOTA, LABELFREQ, MAXRES,
    NOISY, RESOLUTION, and SMOOTHING are no longer available.

  \item  CONTOUR has a new parameter---STATS---which, if set to
    {\tt TRUE}, will compute the number of closed contours and the
    total contour length at each height.  The statistics are written
    to new output parameters called NUMBER and LENGTH respectively.

  \item  \htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN} has a REWIND parameter to enable
    tape rewinding between invocations.  \htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN}
    and FITSIN are available from Linux.

  \item  \htmlref{FITSURFACE}{FITSURFACE} computes and records the
    variances of the polynomial coefficients.

  \item  \htmlref{FITSTEXT}{FITSTEXT} has improved validation of the FITS
    headers.

  \item  \htmlref{LINPLOT}{LINPLOT} has had a big overhaul to make it
    easier to use, especially for composite plots, and to offer more
    facilities. 

    There is an option through parameter ERRBAR to plot error bars
    with a choice of styles (SHAPE) and including co-ordinate errors.
    To avoid clutter the frequency of errors bars is controllable
    using parameter FREQ.  There is a choice of graph styles via
    parameter MODE; these include the histogram form, or points marked
    with a symbol from a selection of five.  Parameters ERRCOL,
    LINCOL, and SYMCOL allow you to select the colours of the error
    bars, graph lines, and symbols respectively.  Thick lines now work
    for all parts of the plot, and the maximum thickness is 10.
    There are new examples.

    LINPLOT was redesigned to allow easy production of composite
    plots, controlled using the CLEAR parameter.  When CLEAR is {\tt
    FALSE} the axis limits are inquired from the graphics database.
    The abscissa limits are now adjustable, so there is a new
    parameter called AXLIM which replaces ORDLIM and applies to both
    axes.  ORDLIM now specifies the ordinate limits, replacing ORDLOW
    and ORDUPP.  The abscissa limits may be adjusted through parameter
    ABSLIM.  Both ABSLIM and ORDLIM have sensible (dynamic) defaults.

    Using the new facilities it is possible to create colour hardcopy
    graphs combining graphs from multiple datasets, with each plotted
    in a different colour and/or linestyle.

  \item  \htmlref{MAKESURFACE}{MAKESURFACE} can create a variance
    array when the new parameter VARIANCE is set to {\tt TRUE}.

  \item  In \htmlref{MLINPLOT}{MLINPLOT}, the LNINDX parameter prompts
    with the current value as the suggested default.

  \item  The \htmlref{SETAXIS}{SETAXIS} documentation has an improved
    description of parameter EXPRS and additional examples.

  \item  \htmlref{SURFIT}{SURFIT} has been rewritten to use the NDF
    library and thus can take advantage of NDF facilities including
    sections and history, and can accept foreign-format files.

    Several of the parameters have been renamed to their standard
    values (INPIC to IN, OUTPIC to OUT, OTITLE to TITLE, WLIMIT to
    WLIM), or combined to make array parameters (IX and IY have become
    BINDIM, NXPAR and NYPAR have become ORDER or KNOTS depending on
    wheher a polyomial or spline fit is selected).  If you use SURFIT
    in scripts, you should check the usage carefully.

  \item  The \htmlref{TRANDAT}{TRANDAT} description has been improved
    and there is an additional example.

  \item  Relaxed the limits of parameter UCOORD in
    \htmlref{TRANSFORMER}{TRANSFORMER}.

\end{itemize}

\section{Release Notes---V0.12}
V0.12 introduces limited support for the NDF WCS component which allows
descriptions of world coordinate systems to be stored within NDF data
structures. Currently, this support only includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item the creation of WCS components by FITSIN and FITSDIN, on the basis of
appropriate keywords supplied in the FITS files.
\item the propagation of WCS components when new NDFs are created based 
on existing NDFs. 
\end{itemize}

The applications affected by these changes are included in the list of
modified applications below.

\subsection{Modified applications}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \htmlref{COMPADD}{COMPADD} now correctly processes NDFs with more
than 2 axes.
  \item \htmlref{COMPAVE}{COMPAVE} now correctly processes NDFs with more
than 2 axes.
  \item \htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY} changed to avoid a spurious error
previously reported if double precision data is displayed which requires
compression to fit in the display.
  \item \htmlref{DIV}{DIV} now stores standard Starlink bad values in the
output NDF for any pixel where the denominator NDF has a zero value. This
used to be the case only on Solaris. Correct behaviour on Linux and
Digital UNIX has required the removal of the facility for trapping
floating overflow conditions which used to be available on Solaris.
  \item \htmlref{DRAWSIG}{DRAWSIG} changed to avoid spurious clearing of
X displays when using two or more GWM windows under ICL.
  \item \htmlref{FFCLEAN}{FFCLEAN} bug fixed which caused parameter
THRESH to be ignored when using a \_DOUBLE data array.
  \item \htmlref{FILLBAD}{FILLBAD} now ignores any input VARIANCE component
if all the variances are bad or zero. Also added protection against
division by zero which occurred if the variance array contained any isolated 
zeros.
  \item \htmlref{FITSEDIT}{FITSEDIT} now creates a new FITS extension if
the specified NDF does not already contain a FITS extension.
  \item \htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN} now creates an NDF WCS component (if
possible) storing a description of any world coordinate systems defined
in the FITS headers.
  \item \htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN} now creates an NDF WCS component (if
possible) storing a description of any world coordinate systems defined
in the FITS headers.
  \item \htmlref{LINPLOT}{LINPLOT} changed to avoid spurious clearing of
X displays when using two or more GWM windows under ICL.
  \item \htmlref{PARGET}{PARGET} bug fixed which caused the application
to terminate if the specified parameter is an array with only a single
element.
  \item \htmlref{ROTATE}{ROTATE} bug fixed which prevented 2-D slices
from n-D cubes being processed.
  \item  \htmlref{TRANMAKE}{TRANMAKE} no longer reports a compilation error 
if a null value is given for parameter CLASS.
\end{itemize}

The following applications now propagate the WCS component of an NDF
structure:

SUBSTITUTE SURFIT THRESH WIENER ZAPLIN

\section{Release Notes---V0.13}
Several applications have been changed to enable them to make use of the
NDF WCS component, which stores descriptions of world co-ordinate systems 
within NDF data structures. In some cases, this has involved major
changes, including the removal of existing parameters and the addition of
new parameters.

\begin{quote}
\emph{ Scripts which make use of any of the removed or modified parameters
will fail when run with KAPPA V0.13. Such scripts will need to be changed
to take account of the new features introduced in this release. Check the
lists below for details.}
\end{quote}

Several new applications have also been written to support the use of the 
WCS component. If no WCS component is present within an NDF, applications
which read the WCS component will attempt to find suitable WCS information 
in one of two other sources. Firstly, any IRAS90 astrometry structure 
contained within an NDF extension will be used. If no such structure can 
be found, any FITS header cards in the FITS extension will be used.
Applications which write WCS information to an NDF will always write it
in the form of a WCS component.

One of the major changes is that some graphics applications which
previously had many parameters to control the appearance of the plot
(ABSLAB, ORDLAB, FONT, PLTITL, {\it etc}), now use a single STYLE
parameter instead. The value supplied for a STYLE parameter should be a
group of {\em plotting attributes}. Defaults for unspecified plotting
attributes are read from text files within \$KAPPA\_DIR (\emph{e.g.}
\verb+$KAPPA_DIR/style.def+}. Alternative defaults files may be specified 
by setting environment variables (\emph{e.g.} {\tt KAPPA\_STYLE}) to hold 
the name of the defaults file to use.

Another major change is that the new and modified applications no longer
use the global COSYS parameter to select \emph{data} ({\it{i.e.}}\ axis) or
\emph{world} ({\it{i.e.}}\ pixel) co-ordinates. Instead, each NDF carries knowledge 
around with it of several co-ordinate ``Frames'', one of which is
nominated as the \emph{current} co-ordinate Frame. This information is
stored in the WCS component of each NDF. All interaction with a given NDF
uses the current co-ordinate Frame when referring to positions within the
NDF. The new application \htmlref{WCSFRAME}{WCSFRAME} can be used to
change the current co-ordinate Frame in an NDF.

A more minor change is that the PXSIZE and PYSIZE parameters have been
removed from the modified graphics applications. These parameters were
previously used to specify the absolute size of the picture in metres.
PICDEF can now be used to do this, using the new SIZE parameter. A picture
of the required size should be created before running the appropriate 
plotting application.

Section \ref{se:agitate} of SUN/95 ``Graphics Database'' has been
completely re-written to illustrate the new WCS facilities of the AGI
graphics database. In addition, two new sections have been added, section
\ref{se:wcsuse} describing the use of WCS information within NDFs, and
section \ref{se:style} the use of graphical style parameters.

\subsection{Modified applications}
   \begin{description}

      \item [\htmlref{COMPADD}{COMPADD}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item The way in which the pixel index bounds of the output
                  NDF are chosen has been changed in order to retain the
                  pixel origin. The compression is now centred on the
                  origin of pixel co-ordinates (previously the lower left
                  corner of the output NDF was assigned the arbitrary
                  pixel indices $[1,1,...]$ irrespective of the origin of
                  the supplied NDF).
            \item Bug fixed which caused errors to be reported if COMPADD
                  was used to compress 1-dimensional data.
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{COMPAVE}{COMPAVE}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item The choice of origin for the output NDF has been changed.
                  See COMPADD above.
            \item Bug fixed which caused errors to be reported if COMPAVE
                  was used to compress 1-dimensional data.
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{COMPICK}{COMPICK}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item The choice of origin for the output NDF has been changed.
                  See COMPADD above.
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{CONTOUR}{CONTOUR}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Axes are now annotated with values in the current co-ordinate
                  Frame of the supplied NDF.
            \item Information describing the co-ordinate Frames available
                  in the supplied NDF is stored with the DATA picture in 
                  the AGI graphics database.
            \item If the screen is not cleared before plotting a contour
                  map ({\it{i.e.}}\ if the parameter CLEAR is set to {\tt FALSE}), then
                  an attempt will be made to align the new contour map 
                  spatially with any existing DATA picture. This alignment
                  occurs by preference in the current co-ordinate Frame
                  of the supplied NDF, but may occur in another Frame if
                  the existing DATA picture does not have suitable WCS 
                  information stored with it.
            \item There is now much greater control over the appearance
                  of the map. This is provided through the STYLE and
                  KEYSTYLE parameters which allow plotting attributes to
                  be set.
            \item The position of the key can now be controlled both
                  vertically and horizontally.

            \item The following parameters have been removed (alternatives to 
                  using these old parameters are indicated): 

               \begin{description}
                  \item[ABSLAB] -- Use the STYLE parameter to specify a

                                   Label(1)}.
                  \item[BORDER] -- Set AXES=TRUE, and suppress everything
                                   but the border by setting suitable plotting 
                                   attributes (eg {\tt MajTickLen=0, 
                                   MinTickLen=0, TextLab=0} {\it etc}).
                  \item[CONCOL] -- Use the {\tt Colour(Cont)} plotting 
                                   attribute (or parameter PENS).
                  \item[COSYS] -- Use application WCSFRAME to set the required 
                                  co-ordinate Frame first.
                  \item[FONT] -- Use the {\tt Font} plotting attributes.

                  \item[MINTIC] -- Use the {\tt MinTick} plotting attribute.
                  \item[ORDLAB] -- Use {\tt Label(2)} plotting attribute.
                  \item[OUTTIC] -- Use {\tt MajTickLen} and {\tt MinTickLen} 
                                   plotting attributes.
                  \item[PLTITL] -- Use the {\tt Title} plotting attribute.
                  \item[PXSIZE] -- Create the picture first using PICDEF,
                                   specifying the required picture size using 
                                   the new parameter SIZE.
                  \item[PYSIZE] -- See PXSIZE.
                  \item[THICK] -- Use the {\tt Width} plotting attributes.
               \end{description}

            \item The following new parameters have been added: KEYPOS, 
                  KEYSTYLE, MARGIN, PENS, STYLE, USEAXIS.
         
            \item The following parameters have been modified:
               \begin{description}
                  \item [AXES] -- Axes are now annotated with the current
                               co-ordinate Frame of the NDF.
                  \item [CLEAR] -- Setting CLEAR={\tt FALSE} cause the new contour map
                               to be aligned spatially with any existing DATA 
                               picture (if possible).
                  \item [KEY] -- The appearance of the key can now be controlled
                              using parameter KEYSTYLE, and the position of the
                              key can be controlled using parameter KEYPOS.
               \end{description}

         \begin{itemize}
            \item The positions are now reported in the current co-ordinate
                  Frame of the picture (by default). This can be changed
                  using the new parameter FRAME.

            \item The format of the reported positions has changed (axis
                  symbols and units are now included, and the picture 
                  comment, name and label are displayed on a separate
                  line).

            \item There are now many more options for marking the positions
                  on the screen. Detailed control over the appearance
                  of these graphics is provided through the new STYLE 
                  parameter.

            \item Control is now available over the minimum and maximum number 
                  of position which may be supplied.

            \item The following parameters have been removed: 
               \begin{description}
                  \item [COLOUR] -- Use the STYLE parameter to specify values
                                    for the {\tt Colour} plotting attributes.

               \begin{description}
                  \item [PLOT] -- Option ``Cross'' has been changed (it now
                               produces a full-screen cross-hair), and 
                               the new options ``Mark'', ``Chain'', ``Box'',
                               ``Vline'', ``Hline'' and ``Text'' have been 
                               added.

            \item Information describing the co-ordinate Frames available
                  in the supplied NDF is stored with the DATA picture in 
                  the AGI graphics database.

            \item There is now much greater control over the appearance
                  of the axes or border. This is provided through the STYLE and
                  BORSTYLE parameters which allow plotting attributes to
                  be set.

            \item The following parameters have been removed:

                               which should be given the formatted 
                               co-ordinates of the position to put at the
                               centre of the picture. These co-ordinates
                               should be expressed within the current 
                               co-ordinate Frame of the NDF.
                  \item [CLEAR] -- The default value is now the current value
                               instead of {\tt FALSE}.
                  \item [FILL] -- The default value is now {\tt TRUE} if the input
                               NDF is 1-dimensional, and {\tt FALSE} otherwise.
                  \item [XMAGN] -- This used to be the number of device
                               pixels per NDF pixel along the horizontal
                               axis. It is now a scaling factor, with a
                               value of 1.0 producing an image which just
                               fills the available width on the screen.
                  \item [YMAGN] -- This has been changed in the same way as
                               XMAGN.
                 \end{description}

         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{LINPLOT}{LINPLOT}] \mbox{} 
         \begin{itemize}
            \item NDFs in which the current co-ordinate Frame has more
                  than 1 dimension can now be handled. For example, a 1-d 
                  trace through a 2-d image will in general have a 2-d current 
                  co-ordinate Frame, even though the pixel array itself is 
                  only 1-d. In this case, the current co-ordinate Frame gives 
                  the position of each pixel within the original 2-d image.

            \item The horizontal axis is now annotated using the 
                  current co-ordinate Frame of the supplied NDF. If this
                  has more than one dimension, then the horizontal axis 
                  can be annotated using any specified axis in the
                  current Frame. Alternatively, the distance from the starting 
                  point to each position on the horizontal axis may be
                  used for the annotation.

            \item There is now much greater control over the appearance
                  of the plot. This is provided through the STYLE
                  parameter.

            \item A key can now be produced indicating the starting and ending 
                  points of the plot within the current co-ordinate Frame
                  of the NDF. Its appearance can be controlled using the
                  KEYSTYLE parameter.

            \item The following parameters have been removed: 

               \begin{description}
                  \item[ABSLAB] -- Use the STYLE parameter to specify a value for the plotting attribute {\tt Label(1)}.
                  \item[ABSLIM] -- Use parameters YBOT and YTOP.
                  \item[AXLIM] -- Use parameter ALIGN.
                  \item[COSYS] -- Use application WCSFRAME to set the required co-ordinate Frame first.
                  \item[ERRCOL] -- Use the {\tt Colour(ErrBars)} plotting attribute.
                  \item[FONT] -- Use the {\tt Font} plotting attributes.
                  \item[LINCOL] -- Use the {\tt Colour(Lines)} plotting attribute.
                  \item[MAJTIC] -- Use the {\tt Gap} plotting attributes.
                  \item[MINTIC] -- Use the {\tt MinTick} plotting attribute.
                  \item[ORDLAB] -- Use {\tt Label(2)} plotting attribute.
                  \item[ORDLIM] -- Use parameters XLEFT and XRIGHT.
                  \item[OUTTIC] -- Use {\tt MajTickLen} and {\tt MinTickLen} plotting attributes.
                  \item[PLTITL] -- Use the {\tt Title} plotting attribute.
                  \item[PXSIZE] -- Create the picture first using PICDEF,
                                   specifying the required picture size using 
                                   the new parameter SIZE.
                  \item[PYSIZE] -- See PXSIZE.
                  \item[SYMCOL] -- Use the {\tt Colour(Symbols)} plotting attribute.
                  \item[THICK] -- Use the {\tt Width} plotting attributes.
                  \item[XLOG] -- Logarithmic X axes are not currently supported.
               \end{description}

            \item The following new parameters have been added: ALIGN,
                  AXES, KEY, KEYSTYLE, MARGIN, MARKER, STYLE, USEAXIS,
                  XLEFT, XRIGHT, XSIGMA, YTOP, YBOT, YSIGMA.
         
            \item The following parameters have been modified:
               \begin{description}
                  \item [MODE] -- The option of supplying an integer marker type
                               has been removed (replaced by parameter MARKER).
                               Options ``Mark'' and ``Chain'' have been added.
                  \item [YLOG] -- Logarithmic data values are now
                               represented as equally spaced values of 
                               $\log(data)$, instead of logarithmically
                               spaced values of $data$.
               \end{description}

         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{NATIVE}{NATIVE}] \mbox{} 
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Any floating point NaN or Inf values in the supplied
                  HDS object are now converted to the appropriate Starlink 
                  bad value. This occurs even if the object already has
                  the appropriate primitive data representation for the
                  machine in use.
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{NDFTRACE}{NDFTRACE}] \mbox{} 
         \begin{itemize}
            \item This now displays the available WCS information within
                  an NDF. If a WCS component is not present within the 
                  NDF, then it will display WCS information derived from
                  an IRAS90 astrometry structure or FITS extension (if
                  possible) as described earlier.

            \item The following new parameters have been added: CURRENT, FDIM,
                  FDOMAIN, FTITLE, FULLFRAME, FULLWCS, WCS.

         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{PICDEF}{PICDEF}] \mbox{} 
         \begin{itemize}
            \item This now allows the picture size to be specified in
                  absolute units (centimetres).

            \item The following new parameter has been added: SIZE

         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{PSF}{PSF}] \mbox{} 
         \begin{itemize}
            \item  This now allows the gamma coefficient to be constrained
                   to be two.  A failure to meet the tolerance test is no 
                   longer fatal. Warning messages showing the requested and 
                   used tolerances replace the error message.

            \item The following new parameter has been added: GAUSS

         \end{itemize}

   \end{description}

\subsection{New applications}
\begin{description}
   \item [\htmlref{CHAIN}{CHAIN}] -- Concatenates a series of NDFs, in the order
         supplied and treated as vectors, to form a 1-dimensional output
         NDF.  The dimensions of the NDFs may be different, and indeed so
         may their dimensionalities.

   \item [\htmlref{COPYBAD}{COPYBAD}] -- Copies the bad pixels from one
         NDF into another.

   \item [\htmlref{LISTMAKE}{LISTMAKE}] -- Creates a catalogue holding a
         \emph{positions list}. These are used to communicate positions
         between applications, together with associated WCS information.
         In addition to numerical axis values, they also contain an
         integer identifier for each position, and a description of the
         available co-ordinate Frames. The positions are supplied by the
         user in a file or in response to parameter prompts. Alternatively,
         the pixel centres in a specified NDF may be used.

   \item [\htmlref{LISTSHOW}{LISTSHOW}] -- Shows a sub-set of the positions
         contained within a \emph{positions list} catalogue, in any 
         of the co-ordinate Frames described within the catalogue. It can also
         write the selected positions to a new
         positions list. The positions are displayed on the screen, and
         can also be marked on the current graphics device in a variety
         of ways.

   \item [\htmlref{PROFILE}{PROFILE}] -- Produces a 1-dimensional NDF
         containing a profile through an N-dimensional NDF, retaining the
         current co-ordinate Frame of the n-dimensional NDF. The data
         values in the output NDF are samples taken along a specified
         1-dimensional curve through the input NDF. 
    
   \item [\htmlref{RESHAPE}{RESHAPE}] -- This application reshapes an NDF to 
         create another NDF by copying array values.  The array components 
         in the input NDF are treated as vectors.  Each output array is 
         filled in order with values from the input vector, until it is 
         full or the input vector is exhausted.  

   \item [\htmlref{WCSADD}{WCSADD}] -- Allows a new co-ordinate Frame to be
         added into the WCS component of an NDF. The new Frame must be
         linearly related to an existing Frame.

   \item [\htmlref{WCSALIGN}{WCSALIGN}] -- Resamples a group of
         2-dimensional NDFs in order to align them with a specified
         reference NDF. The WCS information within the NDFs is used to
         determine the transformations required to achieve alignment.

   \item [\htmlref{WCSATTRIB}{WCSATTRIB}] -- Allows attributes within the
         WCS component of an NDF to be examined or changed.

   \item [\htmlref{WCSCOPY}{WCSCOPY}] -- Copies the WCS component from one
         NDF to another. One use of this is to allow WCS information to
         be re-instated in an NDF after being stripped out by an
         application which does not propagate WCS information.

   \item [\htmlref{WCSFRAME}{WCSFRAME}] -- Allows the current co-ordinate
         Frame within an NDF to be examined and changed.
   
   \item [\htmlref{WCSREMOVE}{WCSREMOVE}] -- Removes one or more co-ordinate
         Frames from the WCS component of an NDF.

   \item [\htmlref{WCSTRAN}{WCSTRAN}] -- Transforms a position from one NDF 
         WCS co-ordinate Frame to another.

\end{description}

\section{Release Notes---V0.13-6}
 No new applications or facilities have been introduced or changed, but 
 the following bugs have been fixed:

\begin{itemize}
\item ARDMASK now sets the bad pixel flag in the output NDF so that 
    other applications interpret the selected pixels as bad.

\item COMPAVE now traps zero variance values, preventing a divide by 
    zero error.

\item CONTOUR no longer draws contours in the background colour if the
    requested contour colour is not available on the selected device.
    This previously could cause contours to be invisible when using a
    monochrome postscript device.

\item History information written to NDFs now contain the up-to-date
    KAPPA package version number.

\item DISPLAY now uses independant compression factors for both axes.
    Previously, an inappropriate compression factor could be used for 
    one of the axes if the lengths of the two axes were very different.
    Also, the default value for MARGIN used when annotated axes are 
    produced, has been changed from 0.16 to 0.2 in order to avoid 
    clipping of labels on certain devices.

\item Trailing spaces are now stripped from the Title attribute of the 
    current WCS Frame.

\item A bug in MATHS which could cause zero variances to be produced sometimes
    when using double precision data has been fixed.

\item NOMAGIC and FILLBAD now set the bad bits flag in the output NDF to
    zero. Previously, NDFs containing QUALITY arrays could still seems
    to contain bad pixels after running NOMAGIC or FILLBAD. This no
    longer happens.

\item WCSREMOVE now issues a warning instead of aborting if an attempt is 
    made to remove the Base Frame of the WCS FrameSet.

\item NATIVE now correctly replaces IEEE NaN and Inf values by Starlink bad
    values on Solaris systems.

\item The global parameter POSITIONS\_LIST has been replaced by CATALOGUE.

\item CONTOUR no longer core dumps if an abort ({\tt !!}) is given for
    parameter PERCENTILES.
 
\end{itemize}
\end{htmlonly}

\section{Release Notes---V0.14-5}

More applications have been changed to enable them to make use
of the NDF WCS component, which stores descriptions of world
co-ordinate systems within NDF data structures. More graphics 
applications have also been changed to use the STYLE parameter 
system introduced in V0.13 to control the detailed appearance of
the plot. In some cases, these have involved major changes, 
including the removal of existing parameters and the addition of 
new parameters.

\begin{quote}
\emph{ Scripts which make use of any of the removed or modified parameters
will fail when run with KAPPA V0.14-5. Such scripts will need to be changed
to take account of the new features introduced in this release. Check the
lists below for details.}
\end{quote}

In addition, KAPPA commands which process individual NDFs or positions
lists can now be supplied with a group of such files, and the application 
will automatically be re-invoked to process the entire group. See section
\latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:multinvoc}}{\htmlref{here}{se:multinvoc}}.

\subsection{Modified applications}
The following applications have been modified:
   \begin{description}

      \item [\htmlref{CENTROID}{CENTROID}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}

            \item Positions can now be read from and written to position
	    list catalogues such as created by CURSOR, LISTMAKE, etc.

            \item All positions, both given by the user and returned by
	    the program, now refer to the Current Frame of the NDF.

            \item Either the initial or final positions may now be marked
	    on the screen (see parameter MARK).

            \item There is now much greater control over the appearance
	    of any annotation draw over the screen. This is provided
	    through the PLOTSTYLE parameter which allow plotting
	    attributes to be set.

            \item The error on the final position is now returned in
	    parameters XERR and YERR.

            \item The following parameters have been removed
	    (alternatives to using these old parameters are indicated):

               \begin{description}
                  \item[COSYS] -- Use application WCSFRAME to set the required
                                  co-ordinate Frame first.
               \end{description}

            \item The following new parameters have been added: DESCRIBE,
	    ERROR, GUESS, INCAT, MARKER, OUTCAT, PLOTSTYLE, QUIET, TITLE,
	    XERR, YERR.

            \item The following parameters have been modified:
               \begin{description}

                  \item[CENTRE] -- This is now a string parameter in
		  which is returned the formatted co-ordinates of the
		  last centroid position, in the current Frame of the
		  NDF.

                  \item[INIT] -- This is now a string parameter which
		  should be given the co-ordinates of the initial guess
		  in the Current Frame of the NDF.

                  \item[MARK] -- Now indicates whether the initial or
		  final positions should be marked on the screen.

                  \item[MODE] -- Now accepts the extra value "Catalogue".

                  \item[XCEN,YCEN] -- These are now string parameters
		  which return the formatted X and Y co-ordinates of the
		  last centroid position, in the current Frame of the
		  NDF.

               \end{description}
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{COMPADD}{COMPADD}] \mbox{}
         A bug has been fixed which could produce incorrect WCS
	 co-ordinates in the output NDF if the lower bounds of the input
	 NDF were not (1,1).

      \item [\htmlref{COMPAVE}{COMPAVE}] \mbox{}
         A bug has been fixed which could produce incorrect WCS
	 co-ordinates in the output NDF if the lower bounds of the input
	 NDF were not (1,1).

      \item [\htmlref{CONTOVER}{CONTOVER}] \mbox{}
         CONTOVER has been scheduled for withdrawl at the next release of
         KAPPA, and a warning message is now displayed every time
         CONTOVER is run. Use ``CONTOUR CLEAR=NO'' instead to draw a contour
         map over an existing data picture.

      \item [\htmlref{CURSOR}{CURSOR}] \mbox{}
         A bug has been fixed which resulted in CURSOR running out of
         picture identifiers (and consequently aborting) if more than
         40 positions were given.

      \item [\htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY}] \mbox{}
         New parameters KEY, KEYPOS and KEYSTYLE have been added, allowing
         DISPLAY to create a key containing a colour ramp in the same style 
         as LUTVIEW.

      \item [\htmlref{DRAWSIG}{DRAWSIG}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item There is now much greater control over the appearance
                  of the lines drawn. Each line may be drawn with a
                  different appearance. This is provided through the 
                  STYLE parameter which allow plotting attributes to
                  be set for each line drawn.

            \item The following parameters have been removed (alternatives to 
                  using these old parameters are indicated): 

               \begin{description}
                  \item[LINESTYLE] -- Use the STYLE parameter to specify a
                                   value for the plotting attribute {\tt 
                                   Style(Lines)}.
                  \item[SIGCOL] -- Use the {\tt Colour(Lines)} plotting attributes.
                  \item[THICK]  -- Use the {\tt Width(Lines)} plotting attributes.
               \end{description}

            \item The following new parameters have been added: STYLE.
         
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{EXP10}{EXP10}] \mbox{}
         This command is now a synonym for {\tt expon base=10D0}.

      \item [\htmlref{EXPE}{EXPE}] \mbox{}
         This command is now a synonym for {\tt expon base=natural}.

      \item [\htmlref{EXPON}{EXPON}] \mbox{}
         Re-written to use NDF data structures.

      \item [\htmlref{FITSMOD}{FITSMOD}] \mbox{}
         A new output parameter EXISTS has been added to store the result
         of the final "Exist" operation.

      \item [\htmlref{GREYPLOT}{GREYPLOT}] \mbox{}
         GREYPLOT has been scheduled for withdrawl at the next release of
         KAPPA, and a warning message is now displayed every time
         GREYPLOT is run. DISPLAY can now produce a key to the colour
         table using the new KEY parameter, so there is no longer any
         real need for GREYPLOT.

      \item [\htmlref{HISTOGRAM}{HISTOGRAM}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item There is now much greater control over the appearance
                  of the plot. This is provided through the STYLE parameter 
                  which allow plotting attributes to be set.

            \item The following parameters have been removed (alternatives to 
                  using these old parameters are indicated): 

               \begin{description}
                  \item[ABSLAB] -- Use the STYLE parameter to specify a
                                   value for the plotting attribute {\tt 
                                   Label(1)}.
                  \item[FONT]   -- Use the {\tt Font} plotting attributes.
                  \item[MAJTIC] -- Use the {\tt Gap} plotting attributes.
                  \item[MINTIC] -- Use the {\tt MinTick} plotting attribute.
                  \item[ORDLAB] -- Use {\tt Label(2)} plotting attribute.
                  \item[OUTTIC] -- Use {\tt MajTickLen} and {\tt MinTickLen} 
                                   plotting attributes.
                  \item[PLTITL] -- Use the {\tt Title} plotting attribute.
                  \item[PXSIZE] -- Create the picture first with the

                  \item[XLOG] -- If a logarithmic horizontal axis is 
                  requested, the axis is now annotated with equally spaced
                  values of the logarithm (base 10) of the data value.

                  \item[YLOG] -- If a logarithmic vertical axis is requested, 
                  the vertical axis is now annotated with equally spaced

         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{LINPLOT}{LINPLOT}] \mbox{}
         A new parameter LMODE has been added to allow the default limits
         for the vertical axis to be chosen in various ways (for instance
         using percentiles, multiples of the standard deviation, \emph{etc}).

      \item [\htmlref{LOG10}{LOG10}] \mbox{}
         This command is now a synonym for {\tt logar base=10D0}.

            ramp and annotation can be specified in a variety of co-ordinate
            systems (specified by the new parameter FRAME).

            \item The following parameters have been removed
	    (alternatives to using these old parameters are indicated):

               \begin{description}

                  \item[ANNOTA] -- Use the STYLE parameter to specify
                  which elements of the annotation (if any) are required.
                  For instance, set "NumLab(1)=0" to suppress the
                  numerical data values.

                  \item[OUTLINE] -- Use the STYLE parameter to specify
                  which elements of the annotation (if any) are required.
                  For instance, set "Border=0" to suppress the box drawn

                  parameter type is now LITERAL rather than \_REAL.

                  \item[UBOUND] -- Now gives the upper bounds in the
                  co-ordinate Frame specified by parameter FRAME. The

	    line width, etc) can now be specified individually using the
	    new PENS and MODE parameters.

            \item Vertical error bars can now be displayed if the
	    supplied NDF has a Variance component (see new parameter
	    ERRBAR).

            \item If the display is not cleared (using parameter CLEAR),
	    then an attempt is made to align the new plot with any
	    existing plot.

            \item The vertical and horizontal position of the key can now
	    be controlled using new parameter KEYPOS, and its appearance
	    can be controlled using new parameter KEYSTYLE.

            \item The following parameters have been modified:
               \begin{description}

                  \item[LNINDX] -- Ranges of pixel indices are now
                  specified using a colon (``:'') instead of a minus sign
                  (``-''). So for instance, pixel rows 5 to 10 would now
                  be given as ``5:10'' and not ``5-10''.

                  \item[OFFSET] -- Now double precision.

                  \item[SPACE] -- Now accepts the additional value ``None''
                  which specifies that all curves should be drawn with

                  \item[YLOG] -- If a logarithmic vertical axis is requested, 
                  the vertical axis is now annotated with equally spaced
                  values of the logarithm (base 10) of the supplied data.
                  Also, the curves are drawn with the vertical offsets
                  specified by parameter SPACE, and the appearance
                  specified by parameters PENS and STYLE.

               \end{description}
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{NORMALIZE}{NORMALIZE}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item There is now much greater control over the appearance
                  of the normalization plot. This is provided through the 
                  STYLE parameter which allow plotting attributes to
                  be set.

            \item The following parameters have been removed (alternatives to 
                  using these old parameters are indicated): 

               \begin{description}
                  \item[ABSLAB] -- Use the STYLE parameter to specify a
                                   value for the plotting attribute {\tt 
                                   Label(1)}.
                  \item[FONT] -- Use the {\tt Font} plotting attributes.
                  \item[MAJTIC] -- Use the {\tt Gap} plotting attributes.

                  \item[ORDLAB] -- Use {\tt Label(2)} plotting attribute.
                  \item[OUTTIC] -- Use {\tt MajTickLen} and {\tt MinTickLen} 
                                   plotting attributes.
                  \item[PTITLE] -- Use the {\tt Title} plotting attribute.
               \end{description}

            \item The following new parameters have been added: AXES, MARGIN, 
                  MARKER, STYLE, XLEFT, XRIGHT, YBOT, YTOP.
         
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{PIXDUPE}{PIXDUPE}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Modified so that pixel origin information is not lost. 
            For instance, if you expand two aligned images by the same 
            factor, they will still be aligned after the expansion.
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{PSF}{PSF}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}

            \item Positions can now be read from position list catalogues 
            such as created by CURSOR, LISTMAKE, etc.

            \item All positions and distances, both given by the user and 
            returned by program, now refer to the Current Frame of the NDF.
            For instance, this means that if the Current Frame of the NDF
            is a SKY Frame, then:

               \begin{itemize}
               \item celestial co-ordinates must be provided for the star 
               positions.
               \item the FWHM will be displayed in arc-seconds. 
               \item the radial distance in the plot will be displayed in 
               arc-seconds.
               \item the orientation of the major axis will be given as a
               position angle (from north through east).
               \end{itemize}

            Note, it is assumed that the image scale does not vary 
            significantly across the image, so you should be cautious
            about using PSF with very large images.

            If, instead, the Current Frame of the NDF is the PIXEL Frame,
            then:

               \begin{itemize}
               \item pixel co-ordinates must be provided for the star 
               positions.
               \item the FWHM will be displayed in pixels. 
               \item the plot will be annotated in pixels.
               \item the orientation of the major axis will be given as the
               angle from the first (X) axis through the second (Y) axis.
               \end{itemize}

            \item The appearance of the annotated axes can now be
	    controlled in much greater detail using the new STYLE
	    parameter.

            \item If the display is not cleared (using parameter CLEAR),
	    then an attempt is made to align the new plot with any
	    existing plot.

            \item The following parameters have been removed
	    (alternatives to using these old parameters are indicated):

               \begin{description}

                  \item[ABSLAB] -- Use the STYLE parameter to specify a
		  value for the plotting attribute {\tt Label(1)}.

                  \item[COSYS] -- Use application WCSFRAME to set the required
                                  co-ordinate Frame first.
                  \item[FONT] -- Use the {\tt Font} plotting attributes.

                  \item[MAJTIC] -- Use the {\tt Gap} plotting attributes.

                  \item[MINTIC] -- Use the {\tt MinTick} plotting attribute.

                  \item[ORDLAB] -- Use {\tt Label(2)} plotting attribute.

                  \item[OUTTIC] -- Use {\tt MajTickLen} and {\tt
		  MinTickLen} plotting attributes.

                  \item[PLTITL] -- Use the {\tt Title} plotting attribute.

                  \item[PXSIZE] -- Create the picture first using PICDEF,
		  the required picture size using the SIZE.

                  \item[PYSIZE] -- See PXSIZE.

                  \item[RADUNITS] -- Use application WCSFRAME to set the required
                                  co-ordinate Frame first, or set the Unit
                                  attribute for axis 1 of the input NDF
                                  using application WCSATTRIB.

                  \item[SCALE] -- Use application WCSFRAME to set the required
                                  co-ordinate Frame first. Create a new
                                  Frame if necessary using application WCSADD.

               \end{description}

            \item The following new parameters have been added: AXES,
            INCAT, MARGIN, MARKER, STYLE, USEAXIS, XLEFT, XRIGHT, YBOT, YTOP.
         
            \item The following parameters have been modified:
               \begin{description}

                  \item[OUT] -- The pixel origin is no longer [1,1].
                  Instead, the pixel bounds are chosen to align the model
		  PSF with the first fitted star in pixel co-ordinates.
		  As a consequence, the PSF centre may not be exactly at
		  the centre of the output image (it will, however, still
		  be within one pixel of the centre). A WCS component is
		  stored in the output NDF holding a copy of the input
		  WCS component. An additional Frame with Domain name
		  OFFSET is added, and is made the current Frame. This
		  Frame measures the distance from the PSF centre in the
		  units in which the FWHM is reported. These changes
		  allows the model PSF to be aligned with the input NDF
		  for comparison purposes, using WCSALIGN, CONTOUR,
   		  \emph{etc}. Also, the output NDF is now created with
                  the same type as the input NDF.

               \end{description}

         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{ROTATE}{ROTATE}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Modified so that rotation occurs around the origin of
            pixel co-ordinates. This means that origin information is not 
            lost. For instance, if you rotate two aligned images by the
            same angle, they will still be aligned after the rotation.
            Negative rotation angles are now accepted.
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{TURBOCONT}{TURBOCONT}] \mbox{}
         TURBOCONT has been scheduled for withdrawl at the next release of
         KAPPA, and a warning message is now displayed every time
         TURBOCONT is run. To retain TURBOCONT would require it to be
         converted to use PGPLOT/AST. This would slow it down so that it
         would offer little speed benefit over CONTOUR. In these days of
         higher powered workstatations the small difference in speed would 
         not justify having two essentially identical applications.

      \item [\htmlref{VECPLOT}{VECPLOT}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Axes are now annotated with values in the current co-ordinate
                  Frame of the supplied NDF.
            \item Information describing the co-ordinate Frames available
                  in the supplied NDF is stored with the DATA picture in 
                  the AGI graphics database.
            \item If the screen is not cleared before plotting a vector
                  map ({\it{i.e.}}\ if the parameter CLEAR is set to {\tt FALSE}), then
                  an attempt will be made to align the new contour map 
                  spatially with any existing DATA picture. This alignment
                  occurs by preference in the current co-ordinate Frame
                  of the supplied vector magnitude NDF, but may occur in 
                  another Frame if the existing DATA picture does not have 
                  suitable WCS information stored with it.
            \item There is now much greater control over the appearance
                  of the map. This is provided through the STYLE and
                  KEYSTYLE parameters which allow plotting attributes to
                  be set.
            \item The position of the key can now be controlled both
                  vertically and horizontally.
            \item The following parameters have been removed (alternatives to 
                  using these old parameters are indicated): 

               \begin{description}
                  \item[ABSLAB] -- Use the STYLE parameter to specify a
                                   value for the plotting attribute {\tt 
                                   Label(1)}.
                  \item[BORDER] -- Set AXES=TRUE, and suppress everything
                                   but the border by setting suitable plotting 
                                   attributes (eg {\tt MajTickLen=0, 
                                   MinTickLen=0, TextLab=0} {\it etc}).
                  \item[COSYS] -- Use application WCSFRAME to set the required

                                  co-ordinate Frame of the NDF.
                  \item [CLEAR] -- Setting CLEAR={\tt FALSE} cause the new contour map
                               to be aligned spatially with any existing DATA 
                               picture (if possible).
                  \item [KEY] -- The appearance of the key can now be controlled
                              using parameter KEYSTYLE, and the position of the
                              key can be controlled using parameter KEYPOS.
               \end{description}
         \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{WCSALIGN}{WCSALIGN}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Several new interpolation methods have been added, and an
            improved algorithm is now used which should be more efficient in 
            some cases.
         \end{itemize}

   \end{description}

\subsection{New applications}
\begin{description}
   \item [\htmlref{COLCOMP}{COLCOMP}] -- Produces a colour composite image 
    from 1, 2 or 3 individual NDFs.
   \item [\htmlref{SCATTER}{SCATTER}] -- Displays a scatter plot between
    data in two n-dimension NDFs.
   \item [\htmlref{KAPVERSION}{KAPVERSION}] -- Check the version number of the 
    installed package.
\end{description}

\subsection{Other Changes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The use of MARGIN parameters to determine the width of the margins 
to place around annotated axes has been changed. The widths of the margins
used to be specified as fractions of the height or width of the
corresponding DATA plot. They are now given as fractions of the height or
width of the current picture. Applications affected include CONTOUR,
DISPLAY, LINPLOT.

\item A bug has been fixed in the random number generators which could
cause the same set of random numbers to be used on succesive invocations
of an application, if the invocations occurred within one second of each
other. For instance, if \htmlref{CREFRAME}{CREFRAME} were used twice to
create two small frames of Gaussian noise with no delay inbetween, then the
resulting images could previously have been identical. Another affected
application is CENTROID -- estimates of the variance of the centroid positions
will now be rather different because previous estimates were based on 
correlated random shifts.

\item Several significant memory leaks have been fixed.

\item The WCS information stored with each picture in the graphics database
now includes a Frame with Domain CURPIC which represents normalized
co-ordinates with in each individual picture. 

\item Defaults for style parameters can now be set for individual
applications. See \latexelsehtml{Section~\ref{se:styles}}
{\htmlref{here}{se:styles}}.

\item The following applications have been converted to use the GKS version of 
PGPLOT instead of SGS/NCAR (there are no changes in functionality): 
\htmlref{GDNAMES}{GDNAMES}, \htmlref{GDCLEAR}{GDCLEAR}, \htmlref{IDCLEAR}{IDCLEAR},
\htmlref{OVCLEAR}{OVCLEAR}, \htmlref{GDSET}{GDSET}, \htmlref{IDSET}{IDSET},
\htmlref{OVSET}{OVSET}, \htmlref{PALENTRY}{PALENTRY}, \htmlref{PALDEF}{PALDEF},
\htmlref{PALSAVE}{PALSAVE}, \htmlref{PALREAD}{PALREAD}.

\item The implementation of dynamic defaults for parameters has been changed.
These were previously indicated in the reference documentation by an
empty default at the end of the parameter description (\emph{i.e.}
\verb+[]+). Such parameters have been changed so that they now have a
null value \verb+[!]+ for the default. This null value is taken as an 
indication that the parameter should use a suitable default value. This 
has been necessary to enable the automatic re-invocation of applications
to process groups of data files. The most noticable result of this change 
will probably be that the parameter values actually used are no longer
stored in the application's parameter file in the user's ADAM directory,
and so they cannot be obtained using \htmlref{PARGET}{PARGET} for instance.
This is a rather unlikely thing to want to do however!

\item A bug has been fixed which could prevent numerical axis labels from
appearing when a set of annotated axes is drawn.

\item The example C-shell script, {\tt multiplot.csh} (see 
\latexelsehtml{section~\ref{se:cshscript}}{\htmlref{here}{se:cshscript}})
has been updated to work with the current version of KAPPA. It now also
uses the Starlink version of \PSMERGEref\ even if another command of that
name is defined.

\end{itemize}

\section{Release Notes---V0.15-9}

More applications have been changed to enable them to make use
of the NDF WCS component, which stores descriptions of world
co-ordinate systems within NDF data structures. More graphics 
applications have also been changed to use the STYLE parameter 
system introduced in V0.13 to control the detailed appearance of
the plot. In some cases, these have involved major changes, 
including the removal of existing parameters and the addition of 
new parameters.

\begin{quote}
\emph{ Scripts which make use of any of the removed or modified parameters
will fail when run with KAPPA V0.15-9. Such scripts will need to be changed
to take account of the new features introduced in this release. Check the
lists below for details.}
\end{quote}

\subsection{New applications}
A new application called \htmlref{COLLAPSE}{COLLAPSE} has been added.
This allows (for instance) a selected range of planes in a 3-D cube to be
collapsed into a single 2-D image, or a range of rows in a 2-D image to
be collapsed into a single 1-D array.

\subsection{Modified applications}
The following applications have been modified:

\begin{description}

   \item [\htmlref{COMPADD}{COMPADD}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item New parameters TRIM and ALIGN have been added to give
               greater control over the exact placement of the compression 
               bins within the input image.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{COMPAVE}{COMPAVE}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item New parameters TRIM and ALIGN have been added to give
               greater control over the exact placement of the compression 
               bins within the input image.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{FITSIN}{FITSIN}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Now supports the new FITS WCS standards based on keywords
               CDi\_j, PVj\_m, \emph{etc}, plus explicit support for the
               previous draft standard (based on PCjjjiii keywords), and
               the AIPS WCS system (based on keywords CDELTj and CROTAj).
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{FITSDIN}{FITSDIN}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Now supports the new FITS WCS standards based on keywords
               CDi\_j, PVj\_m, \emph{etc}, plus explicit support for the
               previous draft standard (based on PCjjjiii keywords), and
               the AIPS WCS system (based on keywords CDELTj and CROTAj).
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{GAUSMOOTH}{GAUSMOOTH}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item The FWHM parameter can now accept values up to 10000.0.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{GDSTATE}{GDSTATE}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}

         \item The bounds of the current picture can now be reported
         in any of the co-ordinate Frames included in the WCS
         information stored with the picture.

         \item The graphical attributes of the box drawn round the
         current picture can now be controlled using the new STYLE 
         parameter.

         \item The Domain of the current Frame associated with the
         picture is now writen to an output parameter.

         \item The following parameters have been removed
	    (alternatives to using these old parameters are indicated):

            \begin{description}
               \item[NCX1, NCX2, etc.] -- Set FRAME=BASEPIC and use X1, 
                               X2, \emph{etc.}, remembering that NCX1
				  \emph{etc.} referred to a Frame in
				  which the longer axis had unit length,
				  where-as the \emph{shorter} axis has unit
				  length in the BASEPIC Frame .
               \item[WCX1, WCX2, etc.] -- Set FRAME=! and use X1, X2,
                               \emph{etc.}
            \end{description}

         \item The following new parameters have been added: DESCRIBE,
	    EPOCH, FRAME, STYLE.

      \end{itemize}

      \item [\htmlref{GLITCH}{GLITCH}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}

            \item GLITCH has been rewritten to use the NDF library and 
            thus can take advantage of NDF facilities including
            sections and history, and can accept foreign-format files.

            \item Variance information is now propagated from input to
            output. The variance associated with each replaced pixel
            is the variance on the median of the corresponding input
            pixels.

            \item When supplying the positions of bad pixels in a text 
            file, the first line in no longer treated as an informational
            header line. Each line in the file must be either a comment 
            starting with the character \verb+#+ or \verb+!+, or a valid 
            position in the current co-ordinate Frame of the input NDF.

            \item The supplied pixel positions now refer to the 
            current co-ordinate Frame of the input NDF, which need not
            necessarily be pixel co-ordinates.

            \item Pixel positions can now be supplied in a positions list
	    catalogue such as created by CURSOR, LISTMAKE, etc.

            \item The WHERE parameter has been renamed as MODE, and the 
            FILENAME parameter has been renamed as INFILE.

            \item The XCOORD and YCOORD parameters have been replaced by
            the single parameter PIXPOS.

            \item The AGAIN parameter has been removed. Looping now
            always occurs in Interface mode unless a value for parameter
            PIXPOS is supplied on the command line.

         \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{HISTOGRAM}{HISTOGRAM}] now supports various methods
         for specifying the upper and lower horizontal limits of the plot.
         See parameter RANGE.

   \item [\htmlref{HISTAT}{HISTAT}] \mbox{}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Now uses an improved algorithm for calculating
                  the median and percentiles which reduces the effect of 
                  extreme outliers on the results.
            \item The NUMBIN parameter has been removed.
         \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{IDSTATE}{IDSTATE}] The changes made to GDSTATE have
   also been made to IDSTATE.

   \item [\htmlref{NDFCOPY}{NDFCOPY}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item New parameters TRIM, TRIMWCS and USEAXIS control the
         removal of output axes which span only a single pixel. Thus,
         NDFCOPY can now be used to extract a single plane from a cube
         and create a genuinely 2 dimensional output image (previously,
         the third pixel axis was retain with bounds spanning a single
         pixel). 
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{PSF}{PSF}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item The default normalization of the model PSF is now chosen
               to give a peak value of exactly 1.0. Previously, the peak
               value could be higher or lower than 1.0 depending on whether
               the PSF was narrower or wider than a Gaussian.
         \item New parameters NORM and AMP1 have been added. NORM allows
               the peak value of the model PSF to be set equal to the
               fitted peak value of the first usable star, instead of
               the default value of 1.0. AMP1 is an output parameter
               which receives the fitted peak value of the first usable
               star, in the data units of the input NDF.
         \item A bug has been fixed which could cause PSF to fail if the
               search box contains any bad pixels.
         \item A bug has been fixed which could incorrect star positions
               to be used (sometimes moving them entirely off the image) 
               if the current Frame of the NDF is AXIS.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{SEGMENT}{SEGMENT}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}

         \item Input positions may now be supplied in the form of
         positions lists as produced by CURSOR, LISTMAKE, \emph{etc.}

         \item In "Interface" and "File" modes, co-ordinates are now
         required in the current Frame of the first supplied input NDF.

         \item A wider range of graphics are now available to mark the
         supplied positions when using cursor mode, and the attributes of 
         these graphics can now be controlled using the new STYLE 
         parameter.

         \item The following parameters have been removed
	    (alternatives to using these old parameters are indicated):

            \begin{description}
               \item[AXES] -- Use new parameter USEAXIS. Note, if the
               data array has more than 2 dimensions and the axes of the 
               current co-ordinate Frame are not parallel to the pixel
               axes, it is usually advisable to set the current co-ordinate
               Frame to PIXEL before using SEGMENT.

               \item[CLEAR] -- Use command {\tt gdclear current} before
               runnning SEGMENT.

               \item[COLOUR] -- Use the new STYLE parameter to set the
               Colour attribute.

               \item[COSYS] -- Use application WCSFRAME to set the required 
                               co-ordinate Frame first.
            \end{description}

         \item The following new parameters have been added: INCAT1 - INCAT20, 
         MARKER, STYLE, USEAXIS. 

         \item The following parameters have been changed:

            \begin{description}
               \item[COORDS] -- Now has type LITERAL instead of \_REAL.
               The position should be given as a pair of formatted axis
               value within the current co-ordinate Frame of the first 
               specified input NDF.

               \item[MODE] -- Now recognizes ``Catalogue'' as a valid
               value.

               \item[PLOT] -- New values ``Chain'' and ``Mark'' replace 
               the old value ``Cross''.

               \item[POLY1-POLY20] -- The supplied files should now
               contain positions in the current co-ordinate Frame of the 
               first specified input NDF.

            \end{description}

      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{SETAXIS}{SETAXIS}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Axis structures can now be added to an NDF by copying them
         from another NDF. The template NDF is specified using the new
         parameter LIKE.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{SURFIT}{SURFIT}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item A new output parameter called RMS has been added. The RMS
         deviation of the fit from the original data (per pixel) is 
         stored in this output parameter on exit.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{ZAPLIN}{ZAPLIN}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}

         \item Positions are now supplied and reported in the current
         co-ordinate Frame of the input NDF.

         \item A wider range of graphics are now available to mark the
         supplied image areas when using cursor mode, and the attributes of 
         these graphics can now be controlled using the new STYLE 
         parameter.

         \item The following parameters have been removed
	    (alternatives to using these old parameters are indicated):

            \begin{description}
               \item[COSYS] -- Use application WCSFRAME to set the required 
                               co-ordinate Frame first.
               \item[MARK] -- Use new parameter PLOT to specify the type
                              of graphics to mark each position with.
            \end{description}

         \item The following new parameters have been added: MARKER, PLOT,
         STYLE, USEAXIS. 

         \item The following parameters have been changed:

            \begin{description}
               \item[COLIN] -- The text file supplied for parameter COLIN
               should now contain axis values in the current co-ordinate 
               Frame of the input NDF.
               \item[COLOUT] -- The created text file contains axis values 
               in the current co-ordinate Frame of the input NDF.
               \item[COLUMNS] -- The supplied values should now refer to the
               first axis in the current co-ordinate Frame of the input NDF.
               \item[LINES] -- The supplied values should now refer to the
               second axis in the current co-ordinate Frame of the input NDF.
            \end{description}

      \end{itemize}

\end{description}

\section{Release Notes---V0.16}

\begin{itemize}

\item The previously undocumented plotting attribute ``{\tt TextBackColour}''
has been included in \hyperref{the section on ``Plotting Styles and 
Attributes''}{section}{}{se:style}. This attributes controls the
background colour to use when drawing text strings within a plot. It can be 
set to a specified colour, or can be set to produce a transparent
background.

\item A bug has been fixed which could cause catalogues stored in a
``Small Text List'' format (\emph{i.e.} with a file type of {\tt .txt}) 
to be unreadable as a KAPPA positions list.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modified applications}
The following applications have been modified:

\begin{description}

   \item [\htmlref{CONTOUR}{CONTOUR}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item It is now possible to draw ``pseudo-contours'' which
               outline regions of the data array chosen in ways other than 
               than by simple data thresholding. Setting MODE to ``Good''
               will produce a ``contour'' which encloses all the good 
               pixel values. Setting MODE to ``Bounds'' will produce 
               a curve which traces the edges of the array.
         \item A new parameter LABPOS has been added which controls
               the position of labels produced when drawing outlines 
               using modes ``Good'' and ``Bounds''.
         \item The number of pen colours used in a cycle if PENROT is set 
               TRUE has been increased from 3 to 5.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{FILLBAD}{FILLBAD}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item A bug has been fixed in FILLBAD which caused the MEMORY=YES
               option to produce incorrect results.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{FITSEDIT}{FITSEDIT}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item FITSEDIT and FITSTEXT both now allow blank keyword values
               to be supplied. They also allow the equals sign to be omitted so 
               long as the keyword value is blank.
         \item A bug has been fixed which caused comments to be lost if
               they abut the keyword value in the text file.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{WCSATTRIB}{WCSATTRIB}] \mbox{} 
      \begin{itemize} 
         \item WCSATTRIB now reports an error if an attempt is made to
	       change attribute values in any of the Frames which are
	       managed internally by the NDF library (that is, Frames
	       with Domains PIXEL, AXIS and GRID). The exception to this
               is that the Domain attribute itself may be changed, thereby 
               adding a new Frame to the WCS component.
      \end{itemize}

\end{description}

\subsection{New applications}
The following new commands have been added:

\begin{description}
   \item [\htmlref{LUTWARM}{LUTWARM}] \mbox{}
       Loads a colour table which goes from black to white, passing
       through warm shades of yellow and brown, as popularised by
       \GAIAref\@.
   \item [\htmlref{OUTLINE}{OUTLINE}] \mbox{}
       Draws an outline of an NDF, optionally aligning it with an
       existing plot. This is a synonym for {\tt contour mode=bounds}.
   \item [\htmlref{PERMAXES}{PERMAXES}] \mbox{}
       Permutes the axes of an NDF. This rearranges the pixel values
       within the NDF and also rearranges the AXIS stuctures and WCS 
       FrameSet so that they refer to the correct pixel axes.
\end{description}

\section{Release Notes---V0.18}

\subsection{New Commands}
The following new applications have been added:
\begin{description}

   \item [\htmlref{ARDPLOT}{ARDPLOT}] \mbox{}
      Plots the boundaries of regions described in an ARD file, over the
      top of a previously displayed picture.

\end{description}

\subsection{Removed Commands}
The following obsolete commands have been removed from KAPPA -
alternatives are indicate below. Many of these commands have been
archived in a new package called \KAPRHref\ in order to satisfy any occasional
need that may occur for them (see SUN/239).
\begin{description}
\item [CONTOVER] Use \htmlref{CONTOUR}{CONTOUR} instead setting parameter
CLEAR to ``N''.
\item [GREYPLOT] Use \htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY} instead setting parameter
KEY to ``Y''.
\item [INSPECT] Use \GAIAref\ instead.
\item [MOSAIC] Use \CCDPACKref\ makemos instead.
\item [QUILT] Use \CCDPACKref\ makemos instead.
\item [SNAPSHOT] Use a commonly available utility such as {\tt xv} instead.
\item [TURBOCONT] Use \htmlref{CONTOUR}{CONTOUR} instead.
\end{description}

\subsection{Modified Commands}
The following applications have been modified:

\begin{description}

   \item [\htmlref{ARDGEN}{ARDGEN}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Re-written to use the PGPLOT graphics library.
         \item The output ARD file now contains WCS information.
         \item A new parameter called STYLE has been added to specify
         the plotting style.
         \item The PALNUM and POICOL parameters have been removed. Use the
         new STYLE parameter instead.
         \item Three new options have been added for parameter OPTION:

      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{ARDMASK}{ARDMASK}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item The COSYS parameter has been removed. Unless the ARD file
               indicates otherwise, positions within the ARD file are now 
               assumed to be in the current Frame of the NDF. The ARD file 
               can contain COFRAME and WCS statements to indicate that
               positions are given in some other co-ordinate Frame.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{COLLAPSE}{COLLAPSE}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item A bug has been fixed which caused unnecessary memory to be
         allocated when ESTIMATOR=MEAN, resulting in an error if insufficient
         memory was available.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{CREFRAME}{CREFRAME}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Now produces an NDF data structure instead of an IMAGE

         \item Parameter FILENAME has been replaced by LOGFILE.
         \item Parameter IDIMS, XDIM and YDIM have been replaced by 
         LBOUND, UBOUND and LIKE.
         \item Parameters BADROW and BADCOL are now INTEGER parameters
         which specify the number of bad rows or columns to add, not
         LOGICAL parameters.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{DISPLAY}{DISPLAY}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item The colour table key can optionally now take the form of 
         coloured histogram of pen numbers, or graphs of RGB intensity 
         against data value. These new facilities are controlled using 
         the KEYSTYLE parameter.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{ELPROF}{ELPROF}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item A new parameter called ESTIMATOR has been added. It allows
               the user to select the method to be used to calculate the 
               output pixel values. At the moment, it gives the choice of 
               a simple mean or a weighted mean, but other options may be
               added in the future.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{LOOK}{LOOK}] \mbox{} 
      \begin{itemize} 
         \item LOOK has been completely re-written to support the full
         features of the NDF data structure. All parameter names have
         changed.
         \item The region to be listed can now be specified either by 
         centre and size, or by bounds, or by an ARD description. See the
         new parameter MODE. Positions should be supplied in the current
         co-ordinate Frame of the NDF.
         \item The output listing can now be produced in several formats
         (see the new parameter FORMAT).
         \item The top right pixel value in the listing is now written to a
         new output parameter, VALUE.
      \end{itemize}
       
   \item [\htmlref{LUTVIEW}{LUTVIEW}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item In addition to a colour ramp, LUTVIEW can now produce keys
          in the form of a coloured histogram of pen numbers, or graphs
          of RGB intensity against data value. These new facilities are
          controlled using the STYLE parameter.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{NORMALIZE}{NROMALIZE}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item The MINPIX parameter now has a default of 2, making it
          much less likely that bins will be rejected from the fit.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{PICCUR}{PICCUR}] \mbox{}

      \begin{itemize}
         \item PICCUR should no longer be used to obtain co-ordinates from a
         graphics device. CURSOR should be used for this purpose. The sole 
         purpose of PICCUR is to allow a new current picture to be selected 
         using a cursor. The position of the cursor is now reported in
         millimetres from the bottom left corner of the screen, but the
         cursor positions cannot be saved.
         \item The parameters COSYS, DOUBLE, LOGFILE and MODE have
         been removed.
         \item New parameters SINGLE and QUIET have been added.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{PICIN}{PICIN}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item A new parameter called FRAME has been added to select the
         co-ordinate Frame for which bounds are to be reported.
         \item The output parameters which were previously used to store
         the bounds of the picture in device, raster and world
         co-ordinates have been replaed with a single set of bounds 
         parameters X1, X2, Y1, and Y2.
         \item An additional output parameter DOMAIN has been added in
         which is stored the Domain of the current co-ordinate system 
         associated with the picture.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{PICTRANS}{PICTRANS}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item The parameters COSYS, INXY, TOBASE, OUTX and OUTY have
         been removed.
         \item Both the input and the output co-ordinate system can now
         be specified, using the parameters FRAMEIN and FRAMEOUT.
         \item The formatted input values are now obtained using parameter 
         POSIN.
         \item The formatted output values are now written to the
         parameter POSOUT.
         \item There is now an option to supress screen output.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{PSF}{PSF}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item A new parameter called PROFOUT has been added. It which allows 
         the displayed profile to be saved in a 1-dimensional NDF.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{SETAXIS}{SETAXIS}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item The MODE parameter can now take the new value ``WCS'',
         which causes the AXIS centre values to be copied from the 
         corresponding axis of the current coordinate Frame in the 
         WCS component of the NDF.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{THRESH}{THRESH}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item A bug has been fixed which could cause bad values in the output
         to be treated as good values.
      \end{itemize}

   \item [\htmlref{WCSALIGN}{WCSALIGN}] \mbox{}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Can now be used with 1-dimensional NDFs.
      \end{itemize}

\end{description}

\subsection{KAPPA Subroutine Libraries}
Many of the internal subroutines used within KAPPA are of potential
use to people developing their own applications. To make it easier for
such people to use the internal facilities of KAPPA, the following
internal subroutine libraries have been removed from KAPPA and are now
distributed as a separate software item called KAPLIBS (see SUN/238):

\begin{itemize}
\item libaif.a   
\item libctg.a   
\item libfits.a  
\item libira.a
\item libkapgen.a
\item libkapgrf.a (contains grf\_kappa.o)
\item liblpg.a
\end{itemize}

If you have applications which used to link against any of these
libraries, you should now include {\tt `kaplibs\_link\_adam`} in your
linking command.

\section{\xlabel{se_changes}Release Notes---V0.19\label{se:changes}}

\subsection{General Changes}
\begin{itemize}

\item Graphics applications are now linked with native PGPLOT, instead
of the Starlink GKS-based version of PGPLOT. Graphics device names can be
given either in the native PGPLOT style (\emph{e.g.} ``/CPS'' for
landscape colour encapsulated postscript) or in the equivalent
traditional Starlink style (\emph{e.g.} ``epsfcol\_l''). Note, postscript
output is now written to a file called \verb+pgplot.ps+ by default, and
each graphics command will over-write any existing file with this name.
That is, no sequence number is added to the end of the file name as used
to be the case with the GKS version of PGPLOT. In order to avoid
over-writing previous graphics files, you can specify an alternative 
output file to use when giving the device name, as in the following 
examples; \verb+fred.ps/CPS+ or \verb+epsfcol_l;fred.ps+.

\item The distinction getween graphics devices and image displays has
been removed. All graphics output from all commands now goes to the 
current \emph{graphics device} set with GDSET. The ID... commands have been
removed.

\item Support for overlay devices has been removed since there are no
native PGPLOT drivers for them. The OV... commands have been removed.

\item Colours can now be specified as RGB intensity triplets, or as HTML
colour codes, in addition to the previous forms.

\item The appearance of textual labels, numerical labels, tick marks,
and axes can now be specified independantly for the two axes of a plot.
See \hyperref{here}{section }{}{se:styles}.

\item 
Each picture in the graphics database now has a co-ordinate Frame with
Domain ``NDC'' associated with it. This Frame covers the whole graphics
device is (0,0) at the bottom left corner and (1,1) at the top right
corner. The name ``NDC'' can now be used with applications such as 
\htmlref{GDSTATE}{GDSTATE}.

\item Applicatons which read positions lists from catalogue files can now
read lists from catalogues which do not contain a WCS FrameSet. If no WCS
FrameSet is found, then a search is made for columns called ``RA'' and
``DEC''. If these columns are found, they are used (is possible), and
qualified by any EPOCH and EQUINOX parameters in the catalogue. If no
such columns are found, a search is made for columns called ``X'' and
``Y''. If found, they are assumed to hold positions in the GRID
co-ordinate Frame. GRID co-ordinates are like PIXEL co-ordinates except
the centre of the bottom left pixel always has GRID co-ordinates ( 1.0,
1.0 ). If a ``Z'' column also exists, the GRID co-ordinates are assumed
to be 3-dimensional.

\item Applications which create catalogues holding positions lists
now allow the user to specify the co-ordinate Frame in which positions
should be stored within the catalogue columns. This is done using a new
parameter called CATFRAME which has been added to all appropriate
commands. Previously positions were always stored in the base Frame of
the associated WCS information. Now, the default is to use SKY coordinates
if available, otherwise PIXEL coordinates.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{New Commands}
The following new applications have been added:

\begin{description}
   \item [\htmlref{LUTCOLD}{LUTCOLD}] \mbox{}
       Loads a colour table which goes from black to white, passing
       through cold shades of pale blue and grey.
   \item [\htmlref{LUTEDIT}{LUTEDIT}] \mbox{}
      Creates or edits an graphics device colour table. It uses a graphical
      user interface to allow interactive manipulation of the colour
      table in many ways.
   \item [\htmlref{RESAMPLE}{RESAMPLE}] \mbox{}
      Applies an arbitrary geometrical transformation to an NDF. This is a 
      WCS-aware replacement for the old TRANSFORMER command.
\end{description}

\subsection{Removed Commands}
The following obsolete commands have been removed from KAPPA -
