      SUBROUTINE KPG1_ARCOL( NDF, INLIST, EXLIST, LENGTH, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_ARCOL

*  Purpose:
*     Forms a list of the available array components in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPG1_ARCOL( NDF, INLIST, EXLIST, LENGTH, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine takes a list of array components and checks whether
*     or not each is defined within an NDF, and if it is, copy the
*     component name to the output list.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF to be inspected for certain array
*        components.
*     INLIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A comma-separated list of the array components whose presence
*        is to be tested.  Valid component names are 'Data', 'Quality',
*        'Variance', and 'Error'.  The component names may be
*        abbreviated.
*     EXLIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        A comma-separated list of the array components of INLIST that
*        are defined in the NDF.  Its length should be as long as the
*        fully expanded list of components.  The components are tested
*        in the order supplied.  Note that mixed case components are
*        returned so that they may be used in reports to users.  Thus
*        the  returned values are 'Data', 'Quality', 'Variance', and
*        'Error' for the array components DATA, QUALITY, VARIANCE, and
*        ERROR respectively.
*     LENGTH = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The effective length of the output list. Returned equal to 1 if
*        an error occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*        Return LENGTH equal to 1 if an error occurs.
