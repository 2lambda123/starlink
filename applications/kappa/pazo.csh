#  Name:
#     pazo

#  Purpose:
#     Allows simple panning and zooming without using IDPAZO.

#  Language:
#     Unix C-shell

#  Invocation:
#     pazo [-d device] 

#  Description:
#     This script allows the user to explore a displayed NDF by displaying 
#     a series of sections from the NDF, selected using the cursor. 
#
#     Clicking the left mouse button twice over the displayed image defines 
#     a rectangular sub-section of the image to be re-displayed. This may be 
#     done repeatedly, resulting in a series of sections being displayed
#     (i.e. zoom in).
#
#     Clicking the left button once followed by the right button, results
#     in the previous sub-section being redisplayed (i.e. zoom out).
#
#     Clicking the right button once results in the script exiting.

#  Arguments:
#     -d
#        The device name.  Defaults to xwindows.

#  Notes:
#     -  Depending on your current settings for DISPLAY, the colour table
#     may change when each new section is displayed, as the scaling
#     algorithm adapts to the different set of pixel values being displayed.
#     -  For ease of use, it's recommended that you set up an alias for
#     this script, for example
#        alias pazo 'source /home/bm/scripts/pazo.csh'

#  Prior Requirements:
#     -  An image must already have been displayed.
