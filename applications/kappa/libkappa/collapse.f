      SUBROUTINE COLLAPSE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     COLLAPSE

*  Purpose:
*     Reduce the number of axes in an N-dimensional NDF by compressing 
*     it along a nominated axis.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL COLLAPSE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application collapses a nominated pixel axis of an 
*     N-dimensional NDF, producing an output NDF with one fewer pixel
*     axes than the input NDF.  A specified range of axis values can
*     be used instead of the whole axis (see parameters LOW and HIGH).
*
*     For each output pixel, all corresponding input pixel values 
*     between the specified bounds of the the nominated axis to be
*     collapsed are combined together using one of a selection of
*     estimators, including a mean, mode, or median, to produce the
*     output pixel value.
*
*     Possible uses include such things as collapsing a range of
*     wavelength planes in a three-dimensional RA/DEC/Wavelength cube to
*     produce a single two-dimensional RA/DEC image, or collapsing a
*     range of slit positions in a two-dimensional slit 
*     position/wavelength image to produce a one-dimensional wavelength
*     array.

*  Usage:
*     collapse in out axis [low] [high] [estimator] [wlim]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AXIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        The axis along which to collapse the NDF.  This can be
*        specified by its integer index within the current Frame of the 
*        input NDF (in the range 1 to the number of axes in the current
*        Frame), or by its symbol string.  A list of acceptable values
*        is displayed if an illegal value is supplied.  If the axes of 
*        the current Frame are not parallel to the NDF pixel axes, then
*        the pixel axis which is most nearly parallel to the specified
*        current Frame axis will be used.
*     ESTIMATOR = LITERAL (Read)
*        The method to use for estimating the output pixel values.  It
*        can be one of the following options.  The first four are
*        more for general collapsing, and the remainder are for cube
*        analysis.
*          "Mean"   -- Mean value
*          "WMean"  -- Weighted mean in wich each data value is weighted
*                      by the reciprocal of the associated variance.  
*          "Mode"   -- Modal value
*          "Median" -- Median value.  Note that this is extremely memory
*                      and CPU intensive for large datasets; use with 
*                      care!  If strange things happen, use "Mean".
*
*          "Absdev" -- Mean absolute deviation from the unweighted mean.
*          "Comax"  -- Co-ordinate of the maximum value.
*          "Comin"  -- Co-ordinate of the minimum value.
*          "Integ"  -- Integrated value, being the sum of the products 
*                      of the value and pixel width in world
*                      co-ordinates.
*          "Iwc"    -- Intensity-weighted co-ordinate, being the sum of 
*                      each value times its co-ordinate, all divided by
*                      the integrated value (see the "Integ" option).
*          "Iwd"    -- Intensity-weighted dispersion of the
*                      co-ordinate, normalised like "Iwc" by the 
*                      integrated value.
*          "Max"    -- Maximum value.
*          "Min"    -- Minimum value.
*          "Rms"    -- Root-mean-square value.
*          "Sigma"  -- Standard deviation about the unweighted mean.
*          "Sum"    -- The total value.
*        ["Mean"]
*     HIGH = LITERAL (Read)
*        A value for the axis specified by parameter AXIS.  For example,
*        if AXIS is 3 and the current Frame of the input NDF has axes
*        RA/DEC/Wavelength, then a wavelength value should be supplied.
*        If, on the other hand, the current Frame in the NDF was the
*        PIXEL Frame, then a pixel co-ordinate value would be required 
*        for the third axis (note, the pixel with index I covers a range
*        of pixel co-ordinates from (I-1) to I).  Together with 
*        parameter LOW, this parameter gives the range of axis values to
*        be compressed.  Note, HIGH and LOW should not be equal.  If a
*        null value (!) is supplied for either HIGH or LOW, the entire
*        range of the axis is collapsed. [!]
*     IN  = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF. 
*     LOW = LITERAL (Read)
*        A value for the axis specified by parameter AXIS.  For example,
*        if AXIS is 3 and the current Frame of the input NDF has axes
*        RA/DEC/Wavelength, then a wavelength value should be supplied.
*        If, on the other hand, the current Frame in the NDF was the
*        PIXEL Frame, then a pixel co-ordinate value would be required
*        for the third axis (note, the pixel with index I covers a range
*        of pixel co-ordinates from (I-1) to I).  Together with 
*        parameter HIGH, this parameter gives the range of axis values
*        to be compressed.  Note, LOW and HIGH should not be equal.
*        If a null value (!) is supplied for either LOW or HIGH, the
*        entire range of the axis is collapsed. [!]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF.
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output NDF structure.  A null value (!)
*        propagates the title from the input NDF to the output NDF. [!]
*     TRIM = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls whether the collapsed axis should be
*        removed from the coordinate syatems desceribing the output NDF.
*        If a TRUE value is supplied, the collapsed WCS axis will be
*        removed from the WCS FrameSet of the output NDF, and the
*        collapsed pixel axis will also be removed from the NDF,
*        resulting in the output NDF having one fewer pixel axes than 
*        the input NDF. If a FALSE value is supplied, the collapsed WCS 
*        and pixel axes are retained in the output NDF, resulting in the 
*        input and output NDFs having the same number of pixel axes. In
*        this case, the pixel index bounds of the collapse axis will be set 
*        to (1:1) in the output NDF (that is, the output NDF will span
*        only a single pixel on the collapse axis). Thus, setting TRIM to
*        FALSE allows information to be retained about the range of values 
*        over which the collapse ocurred. [TRUE]
*     VARIANCE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        A flag indicating whether a variance array present in the
*        NDF is used to weight data values while forming the estimator's
*        statistic, and to derive output variance.  If VARIANCE is TRUE 
*        and the NDF contains a variance array, this array will be
*        used to define the weights, otherwise all the weights will be
*        set equal.  [TRUE]
*     WCSATTS = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings which will be used to make temporary
*        changes to the properties of the current co-ordinate Frame in the WCS 
*        FrameSet before it is used. Supplying a list of attribute values for 
*        this parameter is equivalent to invoking WCSATTRIB on the input NDF 
*        prior to running this command, except that no permanent change
*        is made to the NDF (however the changes are propagated through
*        to the output NDF).
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text 
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files 
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are 
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the 
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a Frame attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute. Any unspecified attributes
*        will retain the value they have in the supplied NDF.  No attribute
*        values will be changed if a null value (!) is supplied.  Any 
*        unrecognised attributes are ignored  (no error is reported). [!]
*     WLIM = _REAL (Read)
*        If the input NDF contains bad pixels, then this parameter
*        may be used to determine the number of good pixels which must
*        be present within the range of collapsed input pixels before a 
*        valid output pixel is generated.  It can be used, for example,
*        to prevent output pixels from being generated in regions where
*        there are relatively few good pixels to contribute to the
*        collapsed result.
*
*        WLIM specifies the minimum fraction of good pixels which must
*        be present in order to generate a good output pixel.  If this 
*        specified minimum fraction of good input pixels is not present,
*        then a bad output pixel will result, otherwise an good output 
*        value will be calculated.  The value of this parameter should 
*        lie between 0.0 and 1.0 (the actual number used will be rounded
*        up if necessary to correspond to at least one pixel). [0.3]

*  Examples:
*     collapse cube slab lambda 4500 4550 
*        The current Frame in the input three-dimensional NDF called 
*        cube has axes with labels "RA", "DEC" and "Lambda", with the 
*        lambda axis being parallel to the third pixel axis.  The above 
*        command extracts a slab of the input cube between wavelengths 
*        4500 and 4550 Angstroms, and collapses this slab into a single
*        two-dimensional output NDF called slab with RA and DEC axes. 
*        Each pixel in the output NDF is the mean of the corresponding 
*        input pixels with wavelengths between 4500 and 4550 Angstroms.
*     collapse cube slab 3 4500 4550 
*        The same as above except the axis to collapse along is
*        specified by index (3) rather than label (lambda).
*     collapse cube slab 3 101.0 134.0
*        This is the same as the above examples, except that the current
*        Frame in the input NDF has been set to the PIXEL Frame (using
*        WCSFRAME), and so the high and low axis values are specified in
*        pixel co-ordinates instead of Angstroms.  Note the difference 
*        between floating-point pixel co-ordinates, and integer pixel 
*        indices (for instance the pixel with index 10 extends from 
*        pixel co-ordinate 9.0 to pixel co-ordinate 10.0).
*     collapse cube slab 3 low=99.0 high=100.0
*        This is the same as the above examples, except that a single
*        pixel plane in the cube (pixel 100) is used to create the
*        output NDF.  Following the usual definition of pixel 
*        co-ordinates, pixel 100 extends from pixel co-ordinate 99.0 to
*        pixel co-ordinate 100.0.  So the given HIGH and LOW values 
*        encompass the single pixel plane at pixel 100.

*  Notes:
*     -  The collapse is always performed along one of the pixel axes,
*     even if the current Frame in the input NDF is not the PIXEL Frame.
*     Special care should be taken if the current Frame axes are not
*     parallel to the pixel axes.  The algorithm used to choose the 
*     pixel axis and the range of values to collapse along this pixel
*     axis proceeds as follows.
*
*     The current Frame co-ordinates of the central pixel in the input
*     NDF are determined (or some other point if the co-ordinates of the
*     central pixel are undefined).  Two current Frame positions are
*     then generated by substituting in turn into this central position 
*     each of the HIGH and LOW values for the current Frame axis 
*     specified by parameter AXIS.  These two current Frame positions
*     are transformed into pixel co-ordinates, and the projections of 
*     the vector joining these two pixel positions on to the pixel axes 
*     are found.  The pixel axis with the largest projection is selected
*     as the collapse axis, and the two end points of the projection 
*     define the range of axis values to collapse.

*     KAPPA: WCSFRAME, COMPAVE, COMPICK, COMPADD.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, VARIANCE,
*     LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS, and HISTORY components of the input NDF
*     and propagates all extensions.  QUALITY is not propagated.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.
*     -  Any number of NDF dimensions is supported.
