      SUBROUTINE SEGMENT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SEGMENT

*  Purpose:
*     Copies polygonal segments from one NDF into another.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SEGMENT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine copies one or more polygonal segments from the first 
*     input NDF (parameter IN1), and pastes them into the second input 
*     NDF (parameter IN2) at the same pixel co-ordinates.  The resulting
*     mosaic is stored in the output NDF (see OUT).  Either input NDF 
*     may be supplied as null ("!") in which case the corresponding 
*     areas of the output NDF are filled with bad values.  For instance,
*     supplying a null value for IN2 allows segments to be cut from IN1
*     and pasted on to a background of bad values.  Supplying a null 
*     value for IN1 allows "holes" to be cut out of IN2 and filled with
*     bad values.
*
*     Each polygonal segment is specified by giving the positions of its
*     vertices. This may be done using a graphics cursor, by supplying
*     a positions list or text file containing the positions, or by
*     supplying the positions in response to a parameter prompt. The
*     choice is made by parameter MODE.
*
*     This application may also be used to cut and paste cylinders with 
*     polygonal cross-sections from NDFs with more than two dimensions. 
*     See the Notes section below for further details. 

*  Usage:
*     segment in1 in2 out { coords=?
*                         { incat1-incat20=?
*                         { poly1-poly20=?
*                         mode

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     COORDS = LITERAL (Read)
*        The co-ordinates of a single vertex for the current polygon.
*        If parameter MODE is set to "Interface", this parameter is 
*        accessed repeatedly to obtain the co-ordinates of all vertices
*        in the polygon.  A null value should be given when the final
*        vertex has been specified.  Each position should be supplied 
*        within the current co-ordinate Frame of the output NDF (see
*        parameter OUT).  Supplying a colon ":" will display details of
*        the required co-ordinate Frame.  No more than two formatted 
*        axis values (separated by a comma or space) may be supplied. 
*        If the co-ordinate Frame being used has more than two axes,
*        then the two axes to use must be specified using parameter 
*        USEAXIS.
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The name of the graphics device on which an image is displayed.
*        Only used if parameter MODE is given the value "Cursor".  Any 
*        graphics specified by parameter PLOT will be produced on this 
*        device.  This device must support cursor interaction.  [Current
*        graphics device]
*     IN1 = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF containing the data to be copied to the inside of
*        the supplied polygonal segments.  If a null value is supplied,
*        the inside of the polygonal segments will be filled with bad
*        values.
*     IN2 = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF containing the data to be copied to the outside
*        of the supplied polygonal segments.  If a null value is
*        supplied, the outside of the polygonal segments will be filled
*        with bad values.
*     INCAT1-INCAT20 = FILENAME (Read)
*        If MODE is "Catalogue", each of the parameters INCAT1 to 
*        INCAT20 are used to access catalogues containing the 
*        co-ordinates of the vertices of a single polygon.  Suitable 
*        catalogues may be created using CURSOR, LISTMAKE, etc.  If a
*        value is assigned to INCAT1 on the command line, you are not 
*        prompted for any of the remaining parameters in this group;
*        additional polygon catalogues must also be supplied on the 
*        command line.  Otherwise, you are prompted for INCAT1, then 
*        INCAT2, etc. until a null value is given or INCAT20 is reached.
*
*        The positions in each catalogue are mapped into the pixel
*        co-ordinate Frame of the output NDF by aligning the WCS
*        information stored in the catalogue with the WCS information in
*        the output NDF.  A message indicating the Frame in which the
*        positions were aligned with the output NDF is displayed.
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Write)
*        The name of a text file in which the co-ordinates of the
*        polygon vertices are to be stored.  A null value (!) means that
*        no file is created.  [!]
*     MARKER = INTEGER (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed if parameter PLOT is set to
*        "Chain" or "Mark". It specifies the type of marker with which 
*        each cursor position should be marked, and should be given as 
*        an integer PGPLOT marker type. For instance, 0 gives a box, 1 
*        gives a dot, 2 gives a cross, 3 gives an asterisk, 7 gives a 
*        triangle. The value must be larger than or equal to -31. 
*        [current value]
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The mode in which the co-ordinates of each polygon vertex are 
*        to be obtained.  The supplied string can be one of the 
*        following selection.
*
*        - "Interface" -- positions are obtained using parameter COORDS.
*        These positions must be supplied in the current co-ordinate
*        Frame of the output NDF (see parameter OUT).
*
*        - "Cursor" -- positions are obtained using the graphics cursor
*        of the device specified by parameter DEVICE.  The WCS 
*        information stored with the picture in the graphics database is
*        used to map the supplied cursor positions into the pixel 
*        co-ordinate Frame of the output NDF.  A message is displayed 
*        indicating the co-ordinate Frame in which the picture and the
*        output NDF were aligned.
*
*        - "Catalogue" -- positions are obtained from positions lists
*        using parameters INCAT1 to INCAT20. Each catalogue defines a
*        single polygon. The WCS information in each catalogue is used
*        to map the positions in the catalogue into the pixel 
*        co-ordinate Frame of the output NDF.  A message is displayed 
*        for each catalogue indicating the co-ordinate Frame in which 
*        the catalogue and the output NDF were aligned.
*
*        - "File" -- positions are obtained from text files using 
*        parameters POLY1 to POLY20.  Each file defines a single 
*        polygon.  Each line in a file must contain two formatted axis
*        values in the current co-ordinate Frame of the output NDF (see
*        parameter OUT), separated by white space or a comma.
*
*        [current value]
*     MAXPOLY = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The maximum number of polygons which can be used.  For
*        instance, this can be set to 1 to ensure that no more than one
*        polygon is used (this sort of thing can be useful when writing
*        procedures or scripts).  A null value causes no limit to be
*        imposed (unless MODE="File" or "Catalogue" in which case a
*        limit of 20 is imposed).  [!]
*     MINPOLY = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The minimum number of polygons which can be used.  For
*        instance, this can be set to 2 to ensure that at least 2
*        polygons are used.  The supplied value must be less than or
*        equal to the value given for MAXPOLY and must be greater than
*        zero.  [1]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF.  If only one input NDF is supplied (that is, if
*        one of IN1 and IN2 is assigned a null value), then the output
*        NDF has the same shape and size as the supplied input NDF. 
*        Also ancillary data such as WCS information is propagated from 
*        the supplied input NDF.  In particular, this means that the 
*        current co-ordinate Frame of the output NDF (in which vertex 
*        positions should be supplied if MODE is "File" or "Interface")
*        is inherited from the input NDF.  If two input NDFs are 
*        supplied, then the shape and size of the output NDF 
*        corresponds to the area of overlap between the two input NDFs 
*        (in pixel space), and the WCS information and current Frame 
*        are inherited from the NDF associated with parameter IN1.
*     PLOT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The type of graphics to be used to mark the position of each
*        selected vertex.  It is only used if parameter MODE is given
*        the value "Cursor".  The appearance of these graphics (colour, 
*        size, etc ) is controlled by the STYLE parameter.  PLOT can 
*        take any of the following values.
*
*        - "None" -- No graphics are produced.
*
*        - "Mark" -- Each position is marked with a marker of type 
*        specified by parameter MARKER.
*
*        - "Poly" -- Causes each position to be joined by a line to the 
*        previous position.  Each polygon is closed by joining the last 
*        position to the first.
*
*        - "Chain" -- This is a combination of "Mark" and "Poly".  Each 
*        position is marked by a marker and joined by a line to the 
*        previous position.  Parameter MARKER is used to specify the 
*        marker  to use.  [current value]
*     POLY1-POLY20 = FILENAME (Read)
*        If MODE is "File", each of the parameters POLY1 to POLY20 are 
*        used to access text files containing the co-ordinates of the 
*        vertices of a single polygon.  If a value is assigned to POLY1
*        on the command line, you are not prompted for any of the 
*        remaining parameters in this group; additional polygon files 
*        must also be supplied on the command line.  Otherwise, you are 
*        prompted for POLY1, then POLY2, etc. until a null value is 
*        given or POLY20 is reached.
*
*        Each position should be supplied within the current 
*        co-ordinate Frame of the output NDF (see parameter OUT).  No 
*        more than two formatted axis values (separated by a comma or 
*        space) may be supplied on each line.  If the co-ordinate Frame
*        being used has more than two axes, then the two axes to use 
*        must be specified using parameter USEAXIS.
*     QUALITY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a TRUE value is supplied for parameter QUALITY then quality
*        information is copied from the input NDFs to the output NDFs.
*        Otherwise, the quality information is not copied.  This
*        parameter is only accessed if all supplied input NDFs have
*        defined QUALITY components.  If any of the supplied input NDFs
*        do not have defined QUALITY components, then no quality is
*        copied.  Note, if a null input NDF is given then the
*        corresponding output QUALITY values are set to zero.  [TRUE]
*     STYLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the style to use when
*        drawing the graphics specified by parameter PLOT.
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text 
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files 
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are 
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the 
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied.  See section 
*        "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description of the 
*        available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are ignored
*        (no error is reported). 
*
*        The appearance of the lines forming the edges of each polygon 
*        is controlled by the attributes Colour(Curves), Width(Curves),
*        etc. (either of the synonyms Lines and Edges may be used in 
*        place of Curves).  The appearance of the vertex markers is 
*        controlled by the attributes Colour(Markers), Size(Markers), 
*        etc. (the synonyms Vertices may be used in place of Markers).  
*        [current value]
*     USEAXIS = GROUP (Read)
*        USEAXIS is only accessed if the current co-ordinate Frame of
*        the output NDF has more than two axes.  A group of two strings
*        should be supplied specifying the two axes spanning the plane 
*        in which the supplied polygons are defined.  Each axis can be
*        specified using one of the following options.
*
*        - An integer index of an axis within the current Frame of the 
*        output NDF (in the range 1 to the number of axes in the current
*        Frame).
*
*        - An axis symbol string such as "RA" or "VRAD".
*
*        - A generic option where "SPEC" requests the spectral axis, 
*        "TIME" selects the time axis, "SKYLON" and "SKYLAT" picks the 
*        sky longitude and latitude axes respectively.  Only those axis 
*        domains present are available as options.
*
*        A list of acceptable values is displayed if an illegal value is 
*        supplied.  If a null (!) value is supplied, the axes with the 
*        same indices as the first two significant NDF pixel axes are 
*        used.  [!]
*     VARIANCE = _LOGICAL (Read) 
*        If a TRUE value is supplied for parameter VARIANCE then
*        variance information is copied from the input NDFs to the
*        output NDFs.  Otherwise, the variance information is not
*        copied.  This parameter is only accessed if all supplied input
*        NDFs have defined VARIANCE components.  If any of the supplied
*        input NDFs do not have defined VARIANCE components, then no
*        variances are copied.  Note, if a null input NDF is given then
*        the corresponding output variance values are set bad.  [TRUE]

*  Examples:
*     segment in1=m51a in2=m51b out=m51_comp incat1=coords mode=cat
*        Copies a region of the NDF m51a to the corresponding position
*        in the output NDF m51_comp.  The region is defined by the list
*        of vertex co-ordinates held in catalogue coords.FIT.  All
*        pixels in the output NDF which fall outside this region are
*        given the corresponding pixel values from NDF m51b.
*     segment in1=m51a out=m51_cut mode=cursor plot=poly accept
*        Copies a region of the NDF m51a to the corresponding position
*        in the output NDF m51_cut.  The region is defined by selecting
*        vertices using a graphics cursor.  The image m51a should
*        previously have been displayed.  Each vertex is joined to the
*        previous vertex by a line on the graphics device.  The
*        ACCEPT keyword causes the suggested null default value for IN2
*        to be accepted.  This means that all pixels outside the region
*        identified using the cursor will be set bad in the output NDF.

*  Notes:
*     -  Supplied positions are mapped into the pixel co-ordinate Frame
*     of the output NDF before being used. This means that the two input
*     NDFs (if supplied) must be aligned in pixel space before using
*     this application.
*     -  The routine can handle NDFs of arbitrary dimensionality.  If
*     either input has three or more dimensions then all planes in the
*     NDF pixel arrays are processed in the same way, that is the same 
*     polygonal regions are extracted from each plane and copied to the
*     corresponding plane of the output NDF.  The plane containing the
*     polygons must be defined using parameter USEAXIS.  This plane is a
*     plane within the current co-ordinate Frame of the output NDF 
*     (which is inherited from the first supplied input NDF).  This
*     scheme will only work correctly if the selected plane in the 
*     current co-ordinate Frame is parallel to one of the planes of the 
*     pixel array.

*     SETMAGIC, THRESH.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine will propagate VARIANCE component values so long
*     as all supplied input NDFs have defined VARIANCE components, and
*     parameter VARIANCE is not FALSE.
*     -  This routine will propagate QUALITY component values so long
*     as all supplied input NDFs have defined QUALITY components, and
*     parameter QUALITY is not FALSE.
*     -  The UNITS, AXIS, LABEL, TITLE, WCS and HISTORY components are
*     propagated from the first supplied input NDF, together with all
*     extensions.
*     -  All non-complex numeric types are supported.  The following
*     data types are processed directly: _WORD, _INTEGER, _REAL,
*     _DOUBLE.
