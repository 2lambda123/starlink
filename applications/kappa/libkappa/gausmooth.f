      SUBROUTINE GAUSMOOTH( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GAUSMOOTH

*  Purpose:
*     Smooths a one- or two-dimensional image using a Gaussian filter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GAUSMOOTH( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application applies a symmetrical filter to a one- or
*     two-dimensional image so as to convolve it with a Gaussian point
*     spread function (PSF) of specified width, or widths and
*     orientation.  The image is held in an NDF data structure.

*  Usage:
*     gausmooth in out fwhm

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BOX() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The x and y sizes (in pixels) of the rectangular region over
*        which the Gaussian PSF should be applied at each point.  The
*        smoothing PSF will be set to zero outside this rectangle,
*        which should therefore be sufficiently large not to truncate
*        the PSF too early.  A square region is defined should only one
*        size be given.  For a one-dimensional or circular Gaussian a
*        second size is ignored.  Two values are expected when an
*        elliptical PSF is requested (see the description of parameter
*        FWHM).
*
*        The values given will be rounded up to positive odd integers
*        if necessary.  If a null (!) value is supplied, the value used
*        is just sufficient to accommodate the Gaussian PSF out to a
*        radius of 3 standard deviations.  Note that the time taken to
*        perform the smoothing increases in approximate proportion to
*        the value of this parameter for a circular Gaussian, and in
*        proportion to the product of the two box sizes for an
*        elliptical Gaussian. [!]
*     FWHM() = _REAL (Read)
*        This specifies whether a circular or elliptical Gaussian
*        point-spread function is used in smoothing a two-dimensional
*        image.  If one value is given it is the full-width at
*        half-maximum of a one-dimensional or circular Gaussian PSF.
*        (Indeed only one value is permitted for a one-dimensional
*        array.)  If two values are supplied, this parameter becomes the
*        full-width at half-maximum of the major and minor axes of an
*        elliptical Gaussian PSF.  Values between 0.1 and 100.0 pixels
*        should be given.  Note that unless a non-default value is
*        specified for the BOX parameter, the time taken to perform the
*        smoothing will increase in approximate proportion to the
*        value(s) of FWHM.  The suggested default is the current value.
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF containing the one- or two-dimensional image to
*        which Gaussian smoothing is to be applied.
*     ORIENT = _REAL (Read)
*        The orientation of the major axis of the elliptical Gaussian
*        PSF, measured in degrees in an anti-clockwise direction from
*        the x axis of the NDF.  ORIENT is not obtained if FWHM has one
*        value, i.e. a circular Gaussian PSF will be used to smooth the
*        image, or the input NDF is one-dimensional.  The suggested
*        default is the current value.
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF which is to contain the smoothed image.
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Value for the title of the output NDF.  A null value will cause
*        the title of the input NDF to be used.  [!]
*     WLIM = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        If the input image contains bad pixels, then this parameter
*        may be used to determine the number of good pixels which must
*        be present within the PSF area before a valid output pixel is
*        generated.  It can be used, for example, to prevent output
*        pixels from being generated in regions where good pixels are
*        only present in the wings of the PSF.
*
*        By default, a null (!) value is used for WLIM, which causes
*        the pattern of bad pixels to be propagated from the input
*        image to the output image unchanged. In this case, smoothed
*        output values are only calculated for those pixels which are
*        not bad in the input image.
*
*        If a numerical value is given for WLIM, then it specifies the
*        minimum PSF-weighted fraction of good pixels which must be
*        present in the PSF area (i.e. box) in order to generate a good
*        output pixel.  The maximum value, in the absence of bad
*        pixels, is unity.  If the specified minimum fraction of good
*        input pixels is not present, then a bad output pixel will
*        result, otherwise a smoothed output value will be calculated.
*        The value of this parameter should lie between 1E-6 and 1.0.
*        [!]

*  Examples:
*     gausmooth image1 image2 5.0
*        Smooths the two-dimensional image held in the NDF structure
*        image1 using a symmetrical Gaussian PSF with a full-width at
*        half-maximum of 5 pixels.  The smoothed image is written to
*        image2.  If any pixels in the input image are bad, then the
*        corresponding pixels in the output image will also be bad.
*     gausmooth spectrum1 spectrum2 5.0 box=9
*        Smooths the one-dimensional image held in the NDF structure
*        spectrum1 using a symmetrical Gaussian PSF with a full-width
*        at half-maximum of 5, and is evaluated over a length of 9
*        pixels.  The smoothed image is written to spectrum2.  If any
*        pixels in the input image are bad, then the corresponding
*        pixels in the output image will also be bad.
*     gausmooth in=a out=b fwhm=3.5 box=31
*        Smooths the two-dimensional image held in the NDF structure a,
*        writing the result into the structure b. The Gaussian
*        smoothing PSF has a full-width at half-maximum of 3.5 pixels
*        and is evaluated over a large square of size 31x31 pixels.
*     gausmooth in=a out=b fwhm=[4,3] orient=52.7 box=[29,33]
*        Smooths the two-dimensional image held in the NDF structure a,
*        writing the result into the structure b.  The elliptical
*        Gaussian smoothing PSF has full-width at half-maximum of 4
*        pixels along its major axis and three pixels along its minor
*        axis, and is evaluated over a large rectangle of size 29x33
*        pixels.  The major axis of the PSF is oriented 52.7 degrees
*        anti-clockwise from the x axis of the data array.
*     gausmooth ngc1097 ngc1097s fwhm=7.2 wlim=0.1
*        Smooths the specified image data using a Gaussian PSF with a
*        full-width at half-maximum of 7.2.  An output value is
*        calculated for any pixel for which the PSF-weighted fraction
*        of good input pixels is at least 0.1.  This will cause the
*        smoothing operation to fill in moderately sized regions of bad
*        pixels.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: BLOCK, CONVOLVE, FFCLEAN, MATHS, MEDIAN, PSF; Figaro:
*     ICONV3, ISMOOTH, IXSMOOTH, MEDFILT.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     VARIANCE, LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS and HISTORY components of the
*     input NDF and propagates all extensions.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.  The bad-pixel flag is also written for the data and
*     variance arrays.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  Arithmetic
*     is performed using single-precision floating point, or double
*     precision, if appropriate.

*  Timing:
*     For a circular PSF, the execution time is approximately
*     proportional to the number of pixels in the image to be smoothed
*     and to the value given for the BOX parameter.  By default, this
*     latter value is proportional to the value given for FWHM.  For an
*     elliptical PSF, the execution time is approximately proportional
*     to the number of pixels in the image to be smoothed and to the
*     product of the values given for the BOX parameter.  By default,
*     these latter values are approximately proportional to the values
*     given for FWHM.  Execution time will be approximately doubled if
*     a variance array is present in the input NDF.
