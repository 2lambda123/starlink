      SUBROUTINE LISTSHOW( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     LISTSHOW

*  Purpose:
*     Reports the positions stored in a positions list.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LISTSHOW( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application reports positions contained in a catalogue.  The
*     catalogue should have the form of a positions list as produced,
*     for instance, by applications LISTMAKE and CURSOR.  By default all
*     positions in the catalogue are reported, but a subset may be
*     reported by specifying a range of "position identifiers" (see
*     parameters FIRST, LAST and STEP).
*
*     Positions may be reported in a range of co-ordinate Frames
*     dependent on the information stored in the supplied positions
*     list (see Parameter FRAME).  The selected positions are written
*     to an output parameter (Parameter POSNS), and may also be written
*     to an output positions list (see Parameter OUTCAT).  The formatted
*     screen output can be saved in a logfile (see Parameter LOGFILE).
*     The formats used to report the axis values can be controlled
*     using Parameter STYLE.
*
*     Graphics may also be drawn marking the selected positions (see
*     parameters PLOT and LABEL).  The supplied positions are aligned
*     with the picture specified by Parameter NAME.  If possible, this
*     alignment occurs  within the co-ordinate Frame specified using
*     Parameter FRAME.  If this is not possible, alignment may occur in
*     some other suitable Frame.  A message is displayed indicating the
*     Frame in which alignment occurred.  If the supplied positions are
*     aligned successfully with a picture, then the range of Frames in
*     which the positions may be reported on the screen is extended to
*     include all those associated with the picture.

*  Usage:
*     listshow incat [frame] [first] [last] [plot] [device]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     CATFRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string determining the co-ordinate Frame in which positions
*        are to be stored in the output catalogue associated with
*        Parameter OUTCAT.  See Parameter FRAME for a description of the
*        allowed values for this parameter.  If a null (!) value is
*        supplied, the positions will be stored in the Frame used to
*        specify positions within the input catalogue. [!]
*     CATEPOCH = DOUBLE PRECISION (Read)
*        The epoch at which the sky positions stored in the output
*        catalogue were determined.  It will only be accessed if an
*        epoch value is needed to qualify the co-ordinate Frame
*        specified by COLFRAME.  If required, it should be given as a
*        decimal years value, with or without decimal places ("1996.8",
*        for example).  Such values are interpreted as a Besselian epoch
*        if less than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch otherwise.
*     CLOSE = LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed if Parameter PLOT is set to
*        "Chain" or "Poly".  If TRUE, polgons will be closed by joining
*        the first position to the last position.  [Current value]
*     DESCRIBE = LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, a detailed description of the co-ordinate Frame in
*        which the positions will be reported is displayed before the
*        positions.  [Current value]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics workstation.  Only accessed if Parameter PLOT
*        indicates that graphics are required.
*        [The current graphics device]
*     DIM = _INTEGER (Write)
*        The number of axes for each position written to output
*        Parameter POSNS.
*     EPOCH = DOUBLE PRECISION (Read)
*        If an IRAS90 Sky Co-ordinate System specification is supplied
*        (using Parameter FRAME) for a celestial co-ordinate system,
*        then an epoch value is needed to qualify it.  This is the epoch
*        at which the supplied sky positions were determined.  It should
*        be given as a decimal years value, with or without decimal
*        places ("1996.8" for example).  Such values are interpreted as
*        a Besselian epoch if less than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch
*        otherwise.
*     FIRST = INTEGER (Read)
*        The identifier for the first position to be displayed.
*        Positions are only displayed which have identifiers in the
*        range given by parameters FIRST and LAST.  If a null (!) value
*        is supplied, the value used is the lowest identifier value in
*        the positions list.  [!]
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string determining the co-ordinate Frame in which positions
*        are to be reported.  This application can report positions in
*        any of the co-ordinate Frames stored with the positions list.
*        The string supplied for FRAME can be one of the following.
*
*        - A Domain name such as SKY, AXIS, PIXEL, etc.
*
*        - An integer value giving the index of the required Frame.
*
*        - An IRAS90 Sky Co-ordinate System (SCS) values such as
*        EQUAT(J2000) (see SUN/163).
*
*        If a null value (!) is supplied, positions are reported in the
*        co-ordinate Frame which was current when the positions list was
*        created.  The user is re-prompted if the specified Frame is not
*        available within the positions list.  The range of Frames
*        available will include all those read from the supplied
*        positions list.  In addition, if a graphics device is opened
*        (i.e. if Parameter PLOT is set to anything other than NONE),
*        then all the Frames associated with the picture specified by
*        Parameter NAME will also be available.  [!]
*     GEODESIC = LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed if Parameter PLOT is set to
*        "Chain" or "Poly".  It specifies whether the curves drawn
*        between positions should be stright lines, or should be
*        geodesic curves.  In many co-ordinate Frames geodesic curves
*        will be simple straight lines.  However, in others (such as the
*        majority of celestial co-ordinate Frames) geodesic curves will
*        be more complex curves tracing the shortest path between two
*        positions in a non-linear projection.  [FALSE]
*     INCAT = FILENAME (Read)
*        A catalogue containing a positions list such as produced by
*        applications LISTMAKE, CURSOR, etc.
*     JUST = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string specifying the justification to be used when
*        displaying text strings at the supplied positions.  This
*        parameter is only accessed if Parameter PLOT is set to "Text".
*        The supplied string should contain two characters; the first
*        should be "B", "C", or "T", meaning bottom, centre, or top
*        respectively.  The second should be "L", "C", or "R", meaning
*        left, centre, or right respectively.  The text is displayed so
*        that the supplied position is at the specified point within
*        the displayed text string.  ["CC"]
*     LABEL = LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE the positions are labelled on the graphics device
*        specified by Parameter DEVICE.  The offset of the centre of
*        each label from the corresponding position is controlled using
*        the "NumLabGap(1)" and "NumLabGap(2)" plotting attributes, and
*        the appearance of the labels is controlled using attributes
*        "Colour(NumLab)", "Size(NumLab)", etc.  These attributes may be
*        specified using Parameter STYLE.  The content of the label is
*        determined by Parameter LABTYPE.  [FALSE]
*     LABTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Determines what sort of labels are drawn if the LABEL parameter
*        is set TRUE. It can be either of the following.
*
*        - "ID" -- causes the integer identifier associated with each
*        row to be used as the label for the row.
*
*        - "LABEL" -- causes the textual label associated with each row
*        to be used as the label for the row.  These strings are read
*        from the "LABEL" column of the supplied catalogue.
*
*        If a null (!) value is supplied, a default of "LABEL" will be
*        used if the input catalogue contains a "LABEL" column.
*        Otherwise, a default of "ID" will be used.  [!]
*     LAST = INTEGER (Read)
*        The identifier for the last position to be displayed.
*        Positions are only displayed which have identifiers in the
*        range given by parameters FIRST and LAST.  If a null (!) value
*        is supplied, the value used is the highest identifier value
*        in the positions list.  [!]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Write)
*        The name of the text file in which the formatted co-ordinates
*        of the selected positions may be stored.  This is intended
*        primarily for recording the screen output, and not for
*        communicating positions to subsequent applications.  A null
*        string (!) means that no file is created.  [!]
*     MARKER = INTEGER (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed if Parameter PLOT is set to
*        "Chain" or "Mark".  It specifies the type of marker with which
*        each position should be marked, and should be given as an
*        integer PGPLOT marker type.  For instance, 0 gives a box, 1
*        gives a dot, 2 gives a cross, 3 gives an asterisk, 7 gives a
*        triangle.  The value must be larger than or equal to -31.
*        [current value]
*     NAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        Determines the graphics database picture with which the
*        supplied positions are to be aligned.  Only accessed if
*        Parameter PLOT indicates that some graphics are to be produced.
*        A search is made for the most recent picture with the
*        specified name (e.g. DATA, FRAME or KEY) within the current
*        picture.  If no such picture can be found, or if a null value
*        is supplied, the current picture itself is used.  The name BASE
*        can also be supplied as a special case, which causes the BASE
*        picture to be used even though it will not in general fall
*        within the current picture.  ["DATA"]
*     NUMBER = _INTEGER (Write)
*        The number of positions selected.
*     OUTCAT = FILENAME (Write)
*        The output catalogue in which to store the selected positions.
*        If a null value is supplied, no output catalogue is produced.
*        See Parameter COLFRAME.  [!]
*     PLOT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The type of graphics to be used to mark the positions on the
*        graphics device specified by Parameter DEVICE.  The appearance
*        of these graphics (colour, size, etc.) is controlled by the
*        STYLE parameter.  PLOT can take any of the following values.
*
*        - "None" -- No graphics are produced.
*
*        - "Mark" -- Each position is marked with a marker of type
*        specified by Parameter MARKER.
*
*        - "Poly" -- Causes each position to be joined by a line to the
*        previous position.   These lines may be simple straight lines
*        or geodesic curves (see Parameter GEODESIC).  The polygons may
*        optionally be closed by joining the last position to the first
*        (see Parameter CLOSE).
*
*        - "Chain" -- This is a combination of "Mark" and "Poly".  Each
*        position is marked by a marker and joined by a line to the
*        previous position.  Parameters MARKER, GEODESIC and CLOSE are
*        used to specify the markers and lines to use.
*
*        - "Box" -- A rectangular box with edges parallel to the edges
*        of the graphics device is drawn between each pair of positions.
*
*        - "Vline" -- A vertical line is drawn through each position,
*        extending the entire height of the selected picture.
*
*        - "Hline" -- A horizontal line is drawn through each position,
*        extending the entire width of the selected picture.
*
*        - "Cross" -- A combination of "Vline" and "Hline".
*
*        - "STCS" -- Indicates that each position should be marked using
*        the two-dimensional STC-S shape read from the catalogue column
*        specified by Parameter STCSCOL.
*
*        - "Text" -- A text string is used to mark each position.  The
*        string is drawn horizontally with the justification specified
*        by Parameter JUST.  The strings to use for each position are
*        specified using Parameter STRINGS.
*
*        - "Blank" -- The graphics device is opened and the picture
*        specified by Parameter NAME is found, but no actual graphics
*        are drawn to mark the positions.  This can be useful if you
*        just want to transform the supplied positions into one of the
*        co-ordinate Frames associated with the picture, without drawing
*        anything (see Parameter FRAME).
*
*        Each position may also be separately labelled with its integer
*        identifier value by giving a TRUE value for Parameter LABEL.
*        ["None"]
*     POSNS() = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        The unformatted co-ordinates of the positions selected by
*        parameters FIRST and LAST, in the co-ordinate Frame selected by
*        FRAME.  The axis values are stored as a 1-dimensional vector.
*        All the axis-1 values for the selected positions are stored
*        first, followed by the axis-2 values, etc.  The number of
*        positions in the vector is written to the output parameter
*        NUMBER, and the number of axes per position is written to the
*        output Parameter DIM.  The axis values may not be in the same
*        units as the formatted values shown on the screen.  For
*        instance, unformatted celestial co-ordinate values are stored
*        in units of radians.
*     STEP = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The increment between position identifiers to be displayed.
*        Specifying a value larger than 1 causes a subset of the position
*        identifiers between FIRST and LAST to be displayed. [1]
*     STCSCOL = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of a catalogue column containing an STC-S description
*        of a two-dimensional spatial shape associated with each
*        position. The STC-S format is an IVOA proposal for describing
*        regions of space, time and spectral position. For further
*        details, see the STC-S document on the IVOA web site
*        (http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/). An STC-S description of a
*        shape includes the co-ordinate system in which the shape is
*        defined. This application assumes that all the STC-S shapes
*        read from the specified column will be defined within the same
*        co-ordinate system. The transformation from the STC-S co-ordinate
*        system to the co-ordinate system of the displayed image is
*        determined once from the first shape plotted, and then re-used
*        for all later shapes. ["Shape"]
*     STRINGS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A group of text strings which are used to mark the supplied
*        positions if Parameter PLOT is set to "TEXT".  The first
*        string in the group is used to mark the first position, the
*        second string is used to mark the second position, etc.  If
*        more positions are given than there are strings in the group,
*        then the extra positions will be marked with an integer value
*        indicating the index within the list of supplied positions.
*        (Note, these integers may be different from the position
*        identifiers in the supplied positions list).  If a null value
*        (!) is given for the parameter, then all positions will be
*        marked with the integer indices, starting at 1.
*
*        A comma-separated list should be given in which each element is
*        either a marker string, or the name of a text file preceded by
*        an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files should contain
*        further comma-separated lists which will be read and
*        interpreted in the same manner.  Note, strings within text
*        files can be separated by new lines as well as commas.
*     STYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the style to use when
*        formatting the co-ordinate values displayed on the screen, and
*        when drawing the graphics specified by Parameter PLOT.
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be
*        read and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings
*        are applied in the order in which they occur within the list,
*        with later settings overriding any earlier settings given for
*        the same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied.  See section
*        "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description of the
*        available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are ignored
*        (no error is reported).
*
*        In addition to the attributes which control the appearance of
*        the graphics (Colour, Font, etc), the following attributes may
*        be set in order to control the appearance of the formatted axis
*        values reported on the screen: Format, Digits, Symbol, Unit.
*        These may be suffixed with an axis number (e.g. "Digits(2)") to
*        refer to the values displayed for a specific axis.
*        [current value]

*  Examples:
*     listshow stars pixel
*        This displays the pixel co-ordinates of all the positions
*        stored in the FITS binary catalogue stars.fit.  They are all
*        written to the output Parameter POSNS.
*     listshow star outcat=star-gal catframe=gal quiet
*        This copies a position list from catalogue "star" to a new
*        catalogue called "star-gal".  The positions are stored in
*        galactic co-ordinates in the output catalogue.
*     listshow stars.fit equat(J2010) first=3 last=3
*        This extracts Position 3 from the catalogue stars.fit
*        transforming it into FK5 equatorial RA/DEC co-ordinates
*        (referenced to the J2010 equinox), if possible.  The RA/DEC
*        values (in radians) are written to the output Parameter POSNS.
*     listshow stars_2.txt style="digits(1)=5,digits(2)=7"
*        This lists the positions in the STL format catalogue contained
*        in text file stars_2.txt in their original co-ordinate Frame.
*        By default, five digits are used to format Axis-1 values, and 7
*        to format Axis-2 values.  These defaults are overridden if the
*        attributes Format(1) and/or Format(2) are assigned values in
*        the description of the current Frame stored in the positions
*        list.
*     listshow s.txt plot=marker marker=3
*              style="colour(marker)=red,size=2"
*        This marks the positions in s.txt on the currently selected
*        graphics device using PGPLOT Marker 3 (an asterisk).  The
*        positions are aligned with the most recent DATA picture in the
*        current picture.  The markers are red and are twice the
*        default size.  The positions are likely not to be reported on
*        the screen.

*  Notes:
*     -  This application uses the conventions of the CURSA package
*     (SUN/190) for determining the formats of input and output
*     catalogues.  If a file type of .fits is given, then the catalogue
*     is assumed to be a FITS binary table.  If a file type of .txt is
*     given, then the catalogue is assumed to be stored in a text file
*     in "Small Text List" (STL) format.  If no file type is given, then
*     ".fit" is assumed.
*     -  The positions are not displayed on the screen when either the
*     message filter environment variable MSG_FILTER is set to NORMAL
*     and any graphics or labels are being plotted (see Parameters PLOT
*     and LABEL); or when MSG_FILTER is set to QUIET and no graphics
*     are produced.  The creation of output parameters and files is
*     unaffected by MSG_FILTER.
