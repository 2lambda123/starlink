      SUBROUTINE CONVOLVE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CONVOLVE

*  Purpose:
*     Convolves a pair of NDFs where the smoothing NDF is one- or
*     two-dimensional

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CONVOLVE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application smooths an NDF using a Point-Spread Function
*     given by a second NDF.  The output NDF is normalised to the same
*     mean data value as the input NDF, and is the same size as the
*     input NDF.

*     The NDF being smoothed may have up to three dimensions.  If it
*     has three significant dimensions, then the filter must be
*     two-dimensional, and it is applied in turn to each plane in the
*     cube and the result written to the corresponding plane in the
*     output cube.  The orientation of the smoothing plane can be
*     specified using the AXES parameter.

*  Usage:
*     convolve in psf out xcentre ycentre

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AXES(2) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed if the NDF has exactly three
*        significant pixel axes.  It should be set to the indices of the
*        NDF pixel axes which span the plane in which smoothing is to
*        be applied.  All pixel planes parallel to the specified plane
*        will be smoothed independently of each other.  The dynamic
*        default is the indices of the first two significant axes in
*        the NDF. []
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF containing the array to be smoothed.
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF which is to contain the smoothed array.
*     PSF = NDF (Read)
*        An NDF holding the Point-Spread Function (PSF) with which the
*        input array is to be smoothed.  An error is reported if the
*        PSF contains any bad pixels.  The PSF can be centred anywhere
*        within the array (see parameters XCENTRE and YCENTRE).  A
*        constant background is removed from the PSF before use.  This
*        background level is equal to the minimum of the absolute value
*        in the four corner pixel values.  The PSF is assumed to be
*        zero beyond the bounds of the supplied NDF.  It should have
*        the same number of dimensions as the NDF being smoothed, unless
*        the input NDF has three significant dimensions, whereupon the
*        PSF must be two-dimensional.
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A title for the output NDF.  A null (!) value means using the
*        title of the input NDF. [!]
*     WLIM = _REAL (Read)
*        If the input array contains bad pixels, then this parameter
*        may be used to determine the number of good pixels which must
*        be present within the smoothing box before a valid output
*        pixel is generated.  It can be used, for example, to prevent
*        output pixels from being generated in regions where there are
*        relatively few good pixels to contribute to the smoothed
*        result.
*
*        By default, a null (!) value is used for WLIM, which causes
*        the pattern of bad pixels to be propagated from the input
*        array to the output array unchanged.  In this case, smoothed
*        output values are only calculated for those pixels which are
*        not bad in the input array.
*
*        If a numerical value is given for WLIM, then it specifies the
*        minimum total weight associated with the good pixels in the
*        smoothing box required to generate a good output pixel
*        (weights for each pixel are defined by the normalised PSF).
*        If this specified minimum weight is not present, then a bad
*        output pixel will result, otherwise a smoothed output value
*        will be calculated.  The value of this parameter should lie
*        between 0.0 and 1.0.  A value of 0.0 will result in a good
*        output pixel being created even if only one good input pixel
*        contributes to it.  A value of 1.0 will result in a good output
*        pixel being created only if all the input pixels which
*        contribute to it are good. [!]
*     XCENTRE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The x pixel index (column number) of the centre of the PSF
*        within the supplied PSF array.  The suggested default is the
*        centre of the PSF array.  (This is how the PSF command would
*        generate the array.)
*     YCENTRE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The y pixel index (line number) of the centre of the PSF
*        within the supplied PSF array.  The suggested default is the
*        centre of the PSF array.  (This is how the PSF command would
*        generate the array.)

*  Examples:
*     convolve ccdframe iraspsf ccdlores 50 50
*        The image in the NDF called ccdframe is convolved using the
*        PSF in NDF iraspsf to create the smoothed image ccdlores.  The
*        centre of the PSF image in iraspsf is at pixel indices
*        (50,50).  Any bad pixels in the input image are propagated to
*        the output.
*     convolve ccdframe iraspsf ccdlores 50 50 wlim=1.0
*        As above, but good output values are only created for pixels
*        which have no contributions from bad input pixels.
*     convolve ccdframe iraspsf ccdlores \
*        As in the first example except the centre of the PSF is located
*        at the centre of the PSF array.

*  Notes:
*     -  The algorithm used is based on the multiplication of the
*     Fourier transforms of the input array and PSF array.
*     -  A PSF can be created using the PSF command or MATHS if the
*     PSF is an analytic function.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: BLOCK, FFCLEAN, GAUSMOOTH, MATHS, MEDIAN, PSF; Figaro:
*     ICONV3, ISMOOTH, IXSMOOTH, MEDFILT.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     VARIANCE, LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS and HISTORY components of the
*     input NDF and propagates all extensions.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  Arithmetic
*     is performed using double-precision floating point.
