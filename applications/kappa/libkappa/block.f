      SUBROUTINE BLOCK( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     BLOCK

*  Purpose:
*     Smooths an NDF using an n-dimensional rectangular box filter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL BLOCK( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application smooths an n-dimensional NDF using a rectangular 
*     box filter, whose dimensionality is the same as that of the NDF 
*     being smoothed.   Each output pixel is either the mean or the 
*     median of the input pixels within the filter box.  The mean 
*     estimator provides one of the fastest methods of smoothing an
*     image and is often useful as a general-purpose smoothing
*     algorithm when the exact form of the smoothing point-spread
*     function is not important.  
*
*     It is possible to smooth in selected dimensions by setting
*     the boxsize to 1 for the dimensions not requiring smoothing.
*     For example you can apply two-dimensional smoothing to the planes
*     of a three-dimensional NDF (see Parameter BOX).  If it has three
*     dimensions, then the filter is applied in turn to each plane in
*     the cube and the result written to the corresponding plane in the 
*     output cube.

*  Usage:
*     block in out box [estimator]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BOX() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The sizes (in pixels) of the rectangular box to be applied to 
*        smooth the data.  These should be given in axis order.  A value
*        set to 1 indicates no smoothing along that axis.  Thus, for
*        example, BOX=[3,3,1] for a three-dimensional NDF would apply a 
*        3x3-pixel filter to all its planes independently.
*
*        If fewer values are supplied than the number of dimensions of
*        the NDF, then the final value will be duplicated for the
*        missing dimensions.
*
*        The values given will be rounded up to positive odd integers, if
*        necessary, to retain symmetry.
*     ESTIMATOR = LITERAL (Read)
*        The method to use for estimating the output pixel values.  It
*        can be either "Mean" or "Median". ["Mean"]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF to which box smoothing is to be applied.
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF which is to contain the smoothed data.
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Value for the title of the output NDF. A null value will cause
*        the title of the input NDF to be used. [!]
*     WLIM = _REAL (Read)
*        If the input image contains bad pixels, then this parameter
*        may be used to determine the number of good pixels which must
*        be present within the smoothing box before a valid output
*        pixel is generated.  It can be used, for example, to prevent
*        output pixels from being generated in regions where there are
*        relatively few good pixels to contribute to the smoothed
*        result.
*
*        By default, a null (!) value is used for WLIM, which causes
*        the pattern of bad pixels to be propagated from the input
*        image to the output image unchanged. In this case, smoothed
*        output values are only calculated for those pixels which are
*        not bad in the input image.
*
*        If a numerical value is given for WLIM, then it specifies the
*        minimum fraction of good pixels which must be present in the
*        smoothing box in order to generate a good output pixel.  If
*        this specified minimum fraction of good input pixels is not
*        present, then a bad output pixel will result, otherwise a
*        smoothed output value will be calculated.  The value of this
*        parameter should lie between 0.0 and 1.0 (the actual number
*        used will be rounded up if necessary to correspond to at least
*        1 pixel). [!]

*  Examples:
*     block aa bb 9
*        Smooths the two-dimensional image held in the NDF structure aa,
*        writing the result into the structure bb.  The smoothing box is
*        9 pixels square.  If any pixels in the input image are bad,
*        then the corresponding pixels in the output image will also be
*        bad.  Each output pixel is the mean of the corresponding input
*        pixels.
*     block spectrum spectrums 5 median title="Smoothed spectrum"
*        Smooths the one-dimensional data in the NDF called spectrum
*        using a box size of 5 pixels, and stores the result in the NDF
*        structure spectrums.  Each output pixel is the median of the
*        corresponding input pixels.  If any pixels in the input image
*        are bad, then the corresponding pixels in the output image
*        will also be bad.  The output NDF has the title "Smoothed
*        spectrum".
*     block ccdin(123,) ccdcol [1,9] 
*        Smooths the 123rd column in the two-dimensional NDF called
*        ccdin using a box size of 9 pixels, and stores the result in
*        the NDF structure ccdcol.  The first value of the smoothing box
*        is ignored as the first dimension has only one element.  Each
*        output pixel is the mean of the corresponding input pixels.
*     block in=image1 out=image2 box=[5,7] estimator=median
*        Smooths the two-dimensional image held in the NDF structure
*        image1 using a rectangular box of size 5x7 pixels.  The
*        smoothed image is written to the structure image2.  Each
*        output pixel is the median of the corresponding input pixels.
*     block etacar etacars box=[7,1] wlim=0.6
*        Smooths the specified image data using a rectangular box 7x1
*        pixels in size.  Smoothed output values are generated only if
*        at least 60% of the pixels in the smoothing box are good,
*        otherwise the affected output pixel is bad.
*     block in=cubein out=cubeout box=[3,3,7]
*        Smooths the three-dimensional NDF called cubein using a box
*        that has three elements along the first two axes and seven
*        along the third.  The smoothed cube is written to NDF cubeout.
*     block in=cubein out=cubeout box=[3,1,7]
*        As the previous example, except that planes comprising the
*        first and third axes are smoothed independently for all
*        lines.

*     ISMOOTH, IXSMOOTH, MEDFILT.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS and HISTORY components of the input NDF
*     and propagates all extensions.  In addition, if the mean estimator
*     is used, the VARIANCE component is also processed.  If the median
*     estimator is used, then the output NDF will have no VARIANCE
*     component, even if there is a VARIANCE component in the input
*     NDF.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.  The bad-pixel flag is also written for the data and
*     variance arrays.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  Arithmetic
*     is performed using single-precision floating point, or double
*     precision, if appropriate.

*  Timing:
*     When using the mean estimator, the execution time is
*     approximately proportional to the number of pixels in the image
*     to be smoothed and is largely independent of the smoothing box
*     size. This makes the routine particularly suitable for applying
*     heavy smoothing to an image.  Execution time will be
*     approximately doubled if a variance array is present in the input
*     NDF.
*
*     The median estimator is much slower than the mean estimator, and
*     is heavily dependent on the smoothing box size.
