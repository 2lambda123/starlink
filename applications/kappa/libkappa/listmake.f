      SUBROUTINE LISTMAKE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     LISTMAKE

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a catalogue holding a positions list.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LISTMAKE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a catalogue containing a list of
*     positions supplied by the user, together with information
*     describing the co-ordinate Frames in which the positions are
*     defined.  Integer position identifiers which allow positions to be
*     distinguished are also stored in the catalogue.  The catalogue may
*     be manipulated using the CURSA package (SUN/190), and is stored in
*     either FITS binary format or the "Small Text List" (STL) format
*     defined by CURSA.
*
*     If an NDF is specified using parameter NDF, then the positions
*     should be given in the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF.
*     Information describing the co-ordinate Frames available within the
*     NDF will be copied to the output positions list.  Subsequent
*     applications can use this information in order to align the
*     positions with other data sets.
*
*     If no NDF is specified, then the user must indicate the
*     co-ordinate Frame in which the positions will be supplied using
*     parameter FRAME.  A description of this Frame will be written to
*     the output positions list for use by subsequent applications.
*
*     The positions themselves may be supplied within a text file,
*     or may be given in response to repeated prompts for a parameter.
*     Alternatively, pixel centres in the NDF supplied for parameter
*     NDF can be used (see parameter MODE).
*
*     The output can be initialised by copying positions from an
*     existing positions list.  Any positions supplied directly by the
*     user are then appended to the end of this initial list (see
*     parameter INCAT).

*  Usage:
*     listmake outcat [ndf] [mode] { file=?
*                                  { position=?
*                                  mode

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     CATFRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string determining the co-ordinate Frame in which positions
*        are to be stored in the output catalogue associated with
*        parameter OUTCAT.  The string supplied for CATFRAME can be one
*        of the following options.
*
*        - A Domain name such as SKY, AXIS, PIXEL, etc.
*
*        - An integer value giving the index of the required Frame.
*
*        - An IRAS90 Sky Co-ordinate System (SCS) values such as
*        EQUAT(J2000) (see SUN/163).
*
*        If a null (!) value is supplied, the positions will be stored
*        in the current Frame. [!]
*     CATEPOCH = DOUBLE PRECISION (Read)
*        The epoch at which the sky positions stored in the output
*        catalogue were determined.  It will only be accessed if an
*        epoch value is needed to qualify the co-ordinate Frame
*        specified by COLFRAME.  If required, it should be given as a
*        decimal years value, with or without decimal places ("1996.8"
*        for example).  Such values are interpreted as a Besselian epoch
*        if less than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch otherwise.
*     DESCRIBE = LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, a detailed description of the co-ordinate Frame in
*        which positions are required will be displayed before the
*        positions are obtained using either parameter POSITION or FILE.
*        [Current value]
*     DIM = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of axes for each position.  It is only accessed if
*        a null value is supplied for parameter NDF.
*     EPOCH = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        If an IRAS90 Sky Co-ordinate System specification is supplied
*        (using parameter DOMAIN) for a celestial co-ordinate system,
*        then an epoch value is needed to qualify it.  This is the epoch
*        at which the supplied sky positions were determined.  It should
*        be given as a decimal years value, with or without decimal
*        places ("1996.8" for example).  Such values are interpreted as
*        a Besselian epoch if less than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch
*        otherwise.
*     FILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        A text file containing the positions to be stored in the output
*        positions list. Each line should contain the formatted axis
*        values for a single position, separated by white space.  It is
*        only accessed if parameter MODE is given the value "File".
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the co-ordinate Frame of the positions supplied through
*        Parameters POSITION or FILE.  There is a cascade of allowed
*        interpretations of this parameter value; the search for the
*        co-ordinate Frame ends once there is a successful interpretation,
*        otherwise the search moves on to the next possible meaning in
*        the following order.
*
*        -  An HDS path containing a WCS FrameSet, whose current
*        Frame defines the co-ordinate Frame.
*
*        -  The name of an NDF, whose current WCS co-ordinate Frame
*        is used.
*
*        -  If the parameter value ends with ".FIT", an attempt is
*        made to interpret the parameter value as the name of a FITS
*        file.  If successful, the primary WCS co-ordinate system from
*        the primary HDU headers is used.
*
*        -  A text file containing either an AST Frame dump (such as
*        produced by commands in the ATOOLS package), or a set of FITS
*        WCS headers.
*
*        -  An IRAS90 "Sky Co-ordinate System" (SCS) string such as
*        "EQUAT(J2000)" (see SUN/163}), whereupon the positions are
*        assumed to be two-dimensional celestial co-ordinates in the
*        specified system.
*
*        -  Domain name without any interpretation.  Any Domain name may
*        be supplied, but normally one of the standard Domain names,
*        such as GRID, PIXEL, GRAPHICS should be given.  Parameter DIM
*        is used to determine the number of axes in the Frame.
*
*        This parameter is only accessed if the parameter NDF is given a
*        null value.
*     INCAT = FILENAME (Read)
*        A catalogue containing an existing positions list which is to
*        be included at the start of the output positions list.  These
*        positions are mapped into the current co-ordinate Frame of the
*        supplied NDF, or into the Frame specified by parameter FRAME if
*        no NDF was supplied.  A message is displayed indicating the
*        Frame in which alignment occurred.  They are then stored in the
*        output list before any further positions are added.  A null
*        value may be supplied if there is no input positions list.  [!]
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The mode by which the positions are to be obtained.  The
*        options are as follows.
*
*        - "Interface" -- The positions are obtained using parameter
*        POSITION.
*
*        - "File" -- The positions are to be read from a text file
*        specified using parameter FILE.
*
*        - "Good" -- The positions used are the pixel centres in the
*        data file specified by parameter NDF.  Only the pixels that
*        have good values in the Data array of the NDF are used.
*
*        - "Pixel" -- The positions used are the pixel centres in the
*        data file specified by parameter NDF.  All pixel are used,
*        whether the pixel values are good or not.
*
*        ["Interface"]
*     NDF = NDF (READ)
*        The NDF which defines the available co-ordinate Frames in the
*        output positions list.  If an NDF is supplied, the positions
*        obtained using parameter POSITION or FILE are assumed to be in
*        the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF, and the WCS component
*        of the NDF is copied to the output positions list.  If a null
*        value is supplied, the single co-ordinate Frame defined by
*        parameter FRAME is stored in the output positions list, and
*        supplied positions are assumed to be in the same Frame.  [!]
*     OUTCAT = FILENAME (Write)
*        The catalogue holding the output positions list.  See also
*        parameter CATFRAME.
*     POSITION = LITERAL (Read)
*        The co-ordinates of a single position to be stored in the
*        output positions list.  Supplying ":" will display details of
*        the co-ordinate Frame in which the position is required.  The
*        position should be given as a list of formatted axis values
*        separated by white space.  You are prompted for new values for
*        this parameter until a null value is entered.   It is only
*        accessed if parameter MODE is given the value "Interface".
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A title for the output positions list.  If a null (!) value is
*        supplied, the value used is obtained from the input positions
*        list if one is supplied.  Otherwise, it is obtained from the
*        NDF if one is supplied.  Otherwise, it is "Output from
*        LISTMAKE".  [!]

*  Examples:
*     listmake newlist frame=pixel dim=2
*        This creates a FITS binary catalogue called newlist.FIT
*        containing a list of positions, together with a description of
*        a single two-dimensional pixel co-ordinate Frame.  The
*        positions are supplied as a set of space-separated pixel
*        co-ordinates in response to repeated prompts for the parameter
*        POSITION.
*     listmake stars.txt frame=equat(B1950) epoch=1962.3
*        This creates a catalogue called stars.txt containing a list of
*        positions, together with a description of a single FK4
*        equatorial RA/DEC co-ordinate Frame (referenced to the B1950
*        equinox).  The catalogue is stored in a text file using the
*        CAT "Small Text List" format ("STL" - see SUN/190).  The
*        positions were determined at epoch B1962.3.  The epoch of
*        observation is required since the underlying model on which the
*        FK4 system is based is non-inertial and rotates slowly with
*        time, introducing fictitious proper motions.  The positions are
*        supplied hours and degrees values in reponse to repeated
*        prompts for parameter POSITIONS.
*     listmake outlist ndf=allsky mode=file file=stars catframe=gal
*        This creates a FITS binary catalogue called outlist.FIT
*        containing a list of positions, together with descriptions of
*        all the co-ordinate Frames contained in the NDF allsky.  The
*        positions are supplied as co-ordinates within the current
*        co-ordinate Frame of the NDF.  Application WCSFRAME can be used
*        to find out what this Frame is.  The positions are supplied in
*        a text file called stars.  The positions are transformed into
*        galactic co-ordinates before being stored in the output.
*     listmake out.txt incat=old.fit frame=gal
*        This creates an STL format catalogue stored in a text file
*        called out.txt containing a list of positions, together with a
*        description of a single galactic co-ordinate Frame.  The
*        positions contained in the existing binary FITS catalogue
*        old.fit are mapped into galactic co-ordinates (if possible)
*        and stored in the output positions list.  Further galactic
*        co-ordinate positions are then obtained by repeated prompting
*        for the parameter POSITION.  These positions are appended to
*        the positions obtained from file old.fit.
*     listmake out.txt incat=old.fit ndf=cobe
*        As above but the output positions list contains copies of all
*        the Frames in the NDF cobe.  The positions in old.fit are
*        mapped into the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF (if
*        possible) before being stored in the output positions list.
*        The new positons must also be supplied in the same Frame (using
*        parameter POSITION).
*     listmake profpos.fit ndf=prof1 mode=pixel
*        This creates a positions list called profpos.fit containing the
*        positions of all the pixel centres in the one-dimensional NDF
*        called prof.  This could for instance be used as input to
*        application PROFILE in order to produce another profile in
*        which the samples are at the same positions as those in NDF
*        prof.

*  Notes:
*     -  This application uses the conventions of the CURSA package
*     for determining the formats of input and output catalogues.  If a
*     file type of .fit is given, then the catalogue is assumed to be a
*     FITS binary table.  If a file type of .txt is given, then the
*     catalogue is assumed to be stored in a text file in STL format.
*     If no file type is given, then ".fit" is assumed.
*     -  There is a limit of 200 on the number of positions which can be
*     given using parameter POSITION.  There is no limit on the number
*     of positions which can be given using parameter FILE.
*     -  Position identifiers are asigned to the supplied positions in
*     the order in which they are supplied.  If no input positions list
*     is given using parameter INCAT, then the first supplied position
*     will be assigned the identifier "1".  If an input positions list
*     is given, then the first supplied position is assigned an
*     identifier one greater than the largest identifier in the input
*     positions list.
