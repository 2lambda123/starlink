      SUBROUTINE PSF( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PSF

*  Purpose:
*     Determines the parameters of a model star profile by fitting star
*     images in a two-dimensional NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PSF( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application finds a set of parameters to describe a model
*     Gaussian star image.  It can be used for profile-fitting stellar
*     photometry, to evaluate correction terms to aperture photometry, 
*     or for filtering.
*
*     The model has a radial profile:
*
*        D =  A exp(-0.5 * (r/sigma) ** gamma )
*
*     where r is calculated from the true radial distance from the star
*     centre allowing for image ellipticity, sigma is the Gaussian
*     precision constant or profile width.  The application combines a
*     number of star images you specify and determines a mean
*     seeing-disc size, radial fall-off parameter (gamma), axis ratio,
*     and orientation of a model star image.
*
*     A table, giving details of the seeing and ellipticity of each
*     star image used can be reported to an output text file.  This
*     table indicates if any star could not be used.  Reasons for 
*     rejecting stars are too-many bad pixels present in the image,
*     the star is too close to the edge of the data array, the
*     `star' is a poor fit to model or it could not be located.
*
*     An optional plot of the mean profile and the fitted function may
*     be produced.  The two-dimensional point-spread function may be 
*     stored in an NDF for later use, as may the one-dimensional fitted 
*     profile.

*  Usage:
*     psf in incat [device] [out] [cut] [range] [isize] [poscols]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AMP1 = _REAL (Write)
*        The fitted peak amplitude of the first usable star, in the data
*        units of the input NDF.
*     AXES = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if labelled and annotated axes are to be drawn around the
*        plot. The width of the margins left for the annotation may be 
*        controlled using parameter MARGIN.  The appearance of the axes 
*        (colours, fonts, etc) can be controlled using the parameter
*        STYLE. [TRUE]
*     AXISR = _REAL (Write)
*        The axis ratio of the star images: the ratio of the major
*        axis length to that of the minor axis.
*     CLEAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE the current picture is cleared before the plot is 
*        drawn.  If CLEAR is FALSE not only is the existing plot 
*        retained, but also an attempt is made to align the new picture 
*        with the existing picture.  Thus you can generate a composite 
*        plot within a single set of axes, say using different colours 
*        or modes to distinguish data from different datasets.  [TRUE]
*     COFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of a text file containing the co-ordinates of the stars
*        to be used.  It is only accessed if parameter INCAT is given a
*        null (!) value.  Each line should contain the formatted axis 
*        values for a single position, in the current Frame of the NDF. 
*        Columns can be separated by spaces, tabs or commas.  The file 
*        may contain comment lines with the first character # or !. 
*        Other columns may be included in the file, in which case the 
*        columns holding the required co-ordinates should be specified 
*        using parameter POSCOLS.
*     CUT = _REAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls the size of the output NDF.  If it is
*        null, !, the dimension of the square NDF will be the size of
*        the region used to calculate the radial profile, which usually
*        is given by RANGE * width in pixels * AXISR, unless truncated.
*        If CUT has a value it is the threshold which must be included
*        in the PSF NDF, and it is given as the fraction of the peak
*        amplitude of the PSF.  For example, if CUT=0.5 the NDF would
*        contain the point-spread function to half maximum.  CUT must
*        be greater than 0 and less than 1.  The suggested default is
*        0.0001.  [!]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics workstation on which to produce a plot of the
*        mean radial profile of the stars and the fitted function.  A
*        null (!) name indicates that no plot is required. 
*        [current graphics device]
*     FWHM = _REAL (Write)
*        The seeing-disc size: the full width at half maximum across the
*        minor axis of the stars.  It is in units defined by the current
*        Frame of the NDF. For instance, a value in arc-seconds will be
*        reported if the current Frame is a SKY Frame, but pixels will
*        be used if it is a PIXEL Frame.
*     GAMMA = _REAL (Write)
*        The radial fall-off parameter of the star images. See the 
*        description for more details.  A gamma of two would be a
*        Gaussian.
*     GAUSS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the gamma coefficient is fixed to be 2; in other words
*        the best-fitting two-dimensional Gaussian is evaluated.  If
*        FALSE, gamma is a free parameter of the fit, and the derived
*        value is returned in parameter GAMMA.  [FALSE]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF containing the star images to be fitted.
*     INCAT = FILENAME (Read)
*        A catalogue containing a positions list (such as produced by
*        applications CURSOR, LISTMAKE, etc.) giving the star positions
*        to use.  If a null (!) value is supplied parameter COFILE will 
*        be used to get the star positions from a simple text file.
*     ISIZE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The side of the square area to be used when forming the 
*        marginal profiles for a star image, given as a number of 
*        pixels.  It should be sufficiently large to contain the entire 
*        star image.  It should be an odd number and must lie in the 
*        range from 3 to 101.  [15]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Text file to contain the table of parameters for each star.  A
*        null (!) name indicates that no log file is required.  [!]
*     MARGIN( 4 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The widths of the margins to leave for axis annotation, given 
*        as fractions of the corresponding dimension of the current 
*        picture.  Four values may be given, in the order: bottom, 
*        right, top, left.  If fewer than four values are given, extra 
*        values are used equal to the first supplied value.  If these 
*        margins are too narrow, any axis annotation may be clipped.  If
*        a null (!) value is supplied, the value used is 0.15 (for all 
*        edges) if either annotated axes or a key are produced, and zero
*        otherwise.  [current value]
*     MARKER = INTEGER (Read)
*        The PGPLOT marker type to use for the data values in the plot. 
*        [current value]
*     MINOR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If MINOR is TRUE the horizontal axis of the plot is annotated
*        with distance along the minor axis from the centre of the PSF.
*        If MINOR is FALSE, the distance along the major axis is used.  
*        [TRUE]
*     NORM = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the model PSF is normalized so that it has a peak
*        value of unity.  Otherwise, its peak value is equal to the peak
*        value of the first usable star, in the data units of the input
*        NDF.  [TRUE]
*     ORIENT = _REAL (Write)
*        The orientation of the major axis of the star images, in 
*        degrees.  If the current Frame of the NDF is a SKY Frame, this 
*        will be a position angle (measured from north through east).  
*        Otherwise, it will be measured from the positive direction of 
*        the first current Frame axis ("X") towards the second current 
*        Frame axis ("Y").
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The NDF containing the fitted point-spread function evaluated
*        at each pixel.  If null, !, is entered no output NDF will be 
*        created.  The dimensions of the array are controlled by 
*        parameter CUT.  The pixel origin is chosen to align the model 
*        PSF with the fitted star in pixel co-ordinates, thus allowing 
*        the NDF holding the model PSF to be compared directly with the 
*        input NDF.  A WCS component is stored in the output NDF holding
*        a copy of the input WCS component.  An additional Frame with 
*        Domain name OFFSET is added, and is made the current Frame. 
*        This Frame measures the distance from the PSF centre in the 
*        units in which the FWHM is reported.  [!]
*     POSCOLS = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Column positions of the co-ordinates (x then y) in an input 
*        record of the file specified by parameter COFILE.  The columns
*        must be different amongst themselves.  If there is duplication
*        new values will be requested.  Only accessed if INCAT is given
*        a null (!) value.  If a null (!) value is supplied for POSCOLS,
*        the values [1,2] will be used.  [!] 
*     PROFOUT = NDF (Write)
*        The NDF containing the one-dimensional fitted profile as 
*        displayed in the plot.  If null, !, is entered no output NDF 
*        will be created.  The DATA component of this NDF holds the 
*        fitted PSF value at each radial bin.  The VARIANCE component 
*        holds the square of the residuals between the fitted values and
*        the binned values derived from the input NDF.  An AXIS 
*        component is included in the NDF containing the radial distance
*        as displayed in the plot.  [!]
*     RANGE = _REAL (Read)
*        The number of image profile widths out to which the radial
*        star profile is to be fitted.  (There is an upper limit of 100
*        pixels to the radius at which data are actually used.)  [4.0]
*     STYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to
*        use when drawing the annotated axes, data values, and the model
*        profile.
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files 
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are 
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with 
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the 
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied.  See section 
*        "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description of the 
*        available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are ignored 
*        (no error is reported). 
*
*        The appearance of the model curve is controlled by the 
*        attributes Colour(Curves), Width(Curves), etc. (the synonym 
*        Line may be used in place of Curves).  The appearance of the 
*        markers representing the real data is controlled by 
*        Colour(Markers), Width(Markers), etc. (the synonym Symbols may 
*        be used in place of Markers).  [current value]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The title for the NDF to contain the fitted point-spread
*        function.  If null (!) is entered the NDF will not contain a
*        title.  ["KAPPA - PSF"]
*     USEAXIS = GROUP (Read)
*        USEAXIS is only accessed if the current co-ordinate Frame of 
*        the NDF has more than two axes.  A group of two strings should 
*        be supplied specifying the two axes which are to be used when
*        determining distances, reporting positions, etc.  Each axis can
*        be specified either by its integer index within the current 
*        Frame (in the range 1 to the number of axes in the current 
*        Frame), or by its Symbol attribute.  A list of acceptable 
*        values is displayed if an illegal value is supplied.  If a null
*        (!) value is supplied, the axes with the same indices as the 
*        two significant NDF pixel axes are used.  [!]
*     XLEFT = _REAL (Read)
*        The axis value to place at the left hand end of the horizontal
*        axis of the plot.  If a null (!) value is supplied, a suitable
*        default value will be found and used.  The value supplied may
*        be greater than or less than the value supplied for XRIGHT.
*        [!]
*     XRIGHT = _REAL (Read)
*        The axis value to place at the right hand end of the horizontal
*        axis of the plot.  If a null (!) value is supplied, a suitable
*        default value will be found and used.  The value supplied may
*        be greater than or less than the value supplied for XLEFT. 
*        [!]
*     YBOT = _REAL (Read)
*        The axis value to place at the bottom end of the vertical axis
*        of the plot.  If a null (!) value is supplied, a suitable 
*        default value will be found and used.  The value supplied may 
*        be greater than or less than the value supplied for YTOP.  [!]
*     YTOP = _REAL (Read)
*        The axis value to place at the top end of the vertical axis of 
*        the plot.  If a null (!) value is supplied, a suitable default
*        value will be found and used.  The value supplied may be 
*        greater than or less than the value supplied for YBOT.  [!]

*  Examples:
*     psf ngc6405i starlist.FIT \
*        Derives the mean point-spread function for the stars images
*        in the NDF called ngc6405i that are situated near the 
*        co-ordinates given in the positions list starlist.FIT. A
*        plot of the profile is drawn on the current graphics device.
*     psf ngc6405i starlist device=!
*        As above but there is no graphical output, and the file type of
*        the input positions list is defaulted.
*     psf ngc6405i cofile=starlist.dat gauss \
*        As the first example, except the psf is fitted to a
*        two-dimensional Gaussian, and the positions are given in a
*        simple text file instead of a positions list.
*     psf incat=starlist.FIT in=ngc6405i logfile=fit.log fwhm=(seeing) \
*        As the first example, but the results, including the fits to
*        each star, are written to the text file fit.log.  The
*        full-width half-maximum is written to the ICL variable SEEING
*        rather than the parameter file.
*     psf ngc6405i starlist isize=31 style="'title=Point spread function'"
*        As the first example, but the area including a star image is
*        31 pixels square, say because the seeing is poor or the pixels
*        are smaller than normal.  The graph is titled "Point spread 
*        function".

*  Notes:
*     -  Values for the FWHM seeing are given in arc-seconds if the
*     Current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF is a SKY Frame.
*     -  The stars used to determine the mean image parameters should
*     be chosen to represent those whose magnitudes are to be found
*     using a stellar photometry application, and to be sufficiently
*     bright, uncrowded, and noise-free to allow an accurate fit to be
*     made.
*     -  It is assumed that the image scale does not vary significantly
*     across the image.
*     -  The iterative method to calculate the fit is as follows.
*        -  Marginal profiles of each star image are formed in four
*        directions: at 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees to the x axis.  The 
*        profiles are cleaned via an iterative modal filter that 
*        removes contamination such as neighbouring stars; moving from 
*        the centre of the star, the filter prevents each data point 
*        from exceeding the maximum of the two previous data values.
*        -  A Gaussian curve and background is fitted to each profile
*        iteratively refining the parameters until parameters differ
*        by less than 0.1 per cent from the previous iteration.  If
*        convergence is not met after fifteen iterations, each fit
*        parameter is approximately the average of its last pair of
*        values.  The initial background is the lower quartile.
*        Using the resulting four Gaussian centres, a mean centre is 
*        found for each star.  Iterations cease when the mean centroid 
*        position shifts by less 0.001 from the previous iteration, or
*        after three iterations if the nominal tolerance is not
*        achieved.
*        -  The four Gaussian widths of all the stars are combined
*        modally, using an amplitude-weighted average with rejection of 
*        erroneous data (using a maximum-likelihood function for a
*        statistical model in which any of the centres has a constant
*        probability of being corrupt).  From the average widths along
*        the four profiles, the seeing-disc size, axis ratio and axis 
*        inclination are calculated.
*        -  The data surrounding each star is then binned into isophotal
*        zones which are elliptical annuli centred on the star---the 
*        ellipse parameters being those just calculated.  The data in 
*        each zone is processed to remove erroneous points (using the 
*        aforementioned maximum-likelihood function) and to find an 
*        average value.  A Gaussian profile is fitted to these average
*        values and the derived amplitude is used to normalise the
*        values to an amplitude of unity.  The normalised values are put
*        into bins together with the corresponding data from all other 
*        stars and these binned data represent a weighted average radial
*        profile for the set of stars, with the image ellipticity
*        removed.  Finally a radial profile is fitted to these data,
*        giving the radial profile parameter gamma and a final 
*        re-estimate of the seeing-disc size.

*     PHOTOM; Starman.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     LABEL, WCS and TITLE components of an NDF data structure.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  The output
*     point-spread-function NDF has the same type as the input NDF.

*     1991 August 20 (MJC):
*        Added FONT parameter.
*     1992 March 3 (MJC):
*        Replaced AIF parameter-system calls by the extended PAR
*        library.
*     1992 April 21 (MJC):
*        Made to handle significant dimensions for user-defined
*        sections.
*     1992 November 30 (MJC):
*        Does not use non-monotonic axis centres.
*     1993 August 27 (MJC):
*        Added ABSLAB, ORDLAB, PLTITL, RADUNITS, SCALE, and MINOR
*        parameters for adjustment of the plotting style, for scaling
*        from pixels to physical units, and for minor-axis profiles.
*     1998 May 26 (MJC):
*        Added GAUSS parameter.  A failure to meet the tolerance test
*        is no longer fatal.  Warning messages showing the requested
*        and used tolerances replace the error message.
*     16-JUL-1999 (TDCA):
*        Converted to use AST/PGPLOT for graphics. Blank lines in
*        co-ordinate file are now ignored, rather than causing a
*        fatal error.
*     20-SEP-1999 (DSB):
*        Modified to expect input positions in the current WCS Frame of
*        the NDF. Removed parameter COSYS, RADUNITS, SCALE. Added INCAT.
*        USEAXIS.

*        Made MARGIN a fraction of the current picture, not the DATA
*        picture.
*     2-MAY-2000 (DSB):
*        Added parameters AMP1 and NORM.
*     17-MAY-2000 (DSB):
*        Added data units to Y axis label of the plot if NORM is FALSE.
*     22-MAY-2000 (DSB):
*        Use an inverted copy of MAP1 when creating MAP3 instead of just
*        temporarily inverting MAP1 itself. This is because the call to
*        AST_SIMPLIFY could otherwise sometimes return a pointer to MAP1
*        (eg if MAP2 was a UnitMap), and so subsequently re-inverting 
*        MAP1 would also invert MAP3.
