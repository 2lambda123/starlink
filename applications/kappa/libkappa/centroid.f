      SUBROUTINE CENTROID ( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CENTROID

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the centroids of star-like features in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CENTROID( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine takes an NDF and returns the co-ordinates of the
*     centroids of features in its data array given approximate initial
*     co-ordinates.  A feature is a set of connected pixels which are
*     above or below the surrounding background region.  For example, a
*     feature could be a star or galaxy on the sky, although the
*     applications is not restricted to 2-dimensional NDFs.
*
*     Four methods are available for obtaining the initial positions, 
*     selected using parameter MODE:
*
*     - from the parameter system (see parameter INIT);
*
*     - using a graphics cursor to indicate the feature in a previously
*     displayed data array (see parameter DEVICE);
*
*     - from a specified positions list (see parameter INCAT); or
*
*     - from a simple text file containing a list of co-ordinates (see
*     parameter COIN).
*
*     In the first two modes the application loops, asking for new
*     feature co-ordinates until it is told to quit or encounters an 
*     error.
*
*     The results may optionally be written to an output positions list
*     which can be used to pass the positions on to another application
*     (see parameter OUTCAT), or to a log file geared more towards human
*     readers, including details of the input parameters (see parameter
*     LOGFILE).  
*
*     The uncertainty in the centroid positions may be estimated if
*     variance values are available within the supplied NDF (see
*     parameter CERROR).

*  Usage:
*     centroid ndf [mode] { init   [search] [maxiter] [maxshift] [toler]
*                         { coin=?
*                         { incat=?
*                       mode

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     CATFRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string determining the co-ordinate Frame in which positions 
*        are to be stored in the output catalogue associated with 
*        parameter OUTCAT.  The string supplied for CATFRAME can be one 
*        of the following options.
*
*        - A Domain name such as SKY, AXIS, PIXEL, etc. 
*
*        - An integer value giving the index of the required Frame.
*
*        - An IRAS90 Sky Co-ordinate System (SCS) values such as 
*        EQUAT(J2000) (see SUN/163).
*
*        If a null (!) value is supplied, the positions will be stored 
*        in a SKY Frame, if a SKY Frame is available within the input 
*        catalogue.  Otherwise, they will be stored in PIXEL 
*        co-ordinates, if a PIXEL Frame is available within the input 
*        catalogue.  Otherwise, they are stored in the base Frame of 
*        the supplied  WCS information.  [!]
*     CATEPOCH = DOUBLE PRECISION (Read)
*        The epoch at which the sky positions stored in the output
*        catalogue were determined.  It will only be accessed if an
*        epoch value is needed to qualify the co-ordinate Frame 
*        specified by COLFRAME.  If required, it should be given as a
*        decimal years value, with or without decimal places ("1996.8" 
*        for example).  Such values are interpreted as a Besselian epoch
*        if less than  1984.0 and as a Julian epoch otherwise. 
*     CENTRE = LITERAL (Write)
*        The formatted co-ordinates of the last centroid position, in
*        the current Frame of the NDF.  
*     CERROR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, errors in the centroided position will be calculated.
*        The input NDF must contain a VARIANCE component in order to 
*        compute errors.  [FALSE]
*     COIN = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of a text file containing the initial guesses at the 
*        co-ordinates of features to be centroided.  It is only accessed
*        if parameter MODE is given the value "File".  Each line should
*        contain the formatted axis values for a single position, in the
*        current Frame of the NDF. Axis values can be separated by 
*        spaces, tabs or commas.  The file may contain comment lines 
*        with the first character # or !. 
*     DESCRIBE = LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, a detailed description of the co-ordinate Frame in 
*        which  the centroided positions will be reported is displayed 
*        before the positions themselves.  [current value]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics device which is to be used to give the initial
*        guesses at the centroid positions.  It is only accessed if 
*        parameter MODE is given the value "Cursor".  
*        [Current graphics device]
*     ERROR = LITERAL (Write)
*        The errors associated with the position written to parameter
*        CENTRE.
*     GUESS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then the supplied guesses for the centroid positions
*        will be included in the screen and log file output, together
*        with the accurate positions.  [current value]
*     INCAT = FILENAME (Read)
*        A catalogue containing a positions list giving the initial
*        guesses at the centroid positions, such as produced by
*        applications CURSOR, LISTMAKE, etc.  It is only accessed if 
*        parameter MODE is given the value "Catalogue". 
*     INIT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An initial guess at the co-ordinates of the next feature to be 
*        centroided, in the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF
*        (supplying a colon ":" will display details of the current 
*        co-ordinate Frame).  The position should be supplied as a 
*        list of formatted axis values separated by spaces or commas. 
*        INIT is only accessed if parameter MODE is given the value 
*        "Interface".  If the initial co-ordinates are supplied on the 
*        command line only one centroid will be found; otherwise the 
*        application will ask for further guesses, which may be
*        terminated by supplying the null value (!). 
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the text file to log the results.  If null, there
*        will be no logging.  Note this is intended for the human reader
*        and is not intended for passing to other applications.  [!]
*     MARK = LITERAL (Read)
*        Only accessed if parameter MODE is given the value "Cursor". 
*        It indicates which positions are to be marked on the screen 
*        using the marker type given by parameter MARKER.  It can take
*        any of the following values.
*
*        - "Initial"  -- The position of the cursor when the mouse
*                        button is pressed is marked.
*
*        - "Centroid" -- The corresponding centroid position is marked.
*
*        - "None"     -- No positions are marked.
*
*        [current value]
*     MARKER = INTEGER (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed if parameter MARK is set TRUE.
*        It specifies the type of marker with which each cursor position
*        should be marked, and should be given as an integer PGPLOT
*        marker type.  For instance, 0 gives a box, 1 gives a dot, 2 
*        gives a cross, 3 gives an asterisk, 7 gives a triangle.  The 
*        value must be larger than or equal to -31.  [current value]
*     MAXITER = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Maximum number of iterations to be used in the search.  It must
*        be in the range 1--9.  The dynamic default is 3.  [9]
*     MAXSHIFT() = _REAL (Read)
*        Maximum shift in each dimension allowed between the guess and
*        output positions in pixels.  Each must lie in the range
*        0.0--26.0.  If only a single value is given, then it will be
*        duplicated to all dimensions.  The dynamic default is half of
*        SEARCH + 1.  [9.0]
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The mode in which the initial co-ordinates are to be obtained.
*        The supplied string can be one of the following values.
*
*        - "Interface" -- positions are obtained using parameter INIT.
*
*        - "Cursor"    -- positions are obtained using the graphics 
*                         cursor of the device specified by parameter 
*                         DEVICE.
*
*        - "Catalogue" -- positions are obtained from a positions list
*                         using parameter INCAT.
*
*        - "File"      -- positions are obtained from a text file using 
*                         parameter COIN.
*
*        [current value]
*     NDF = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF structure containing the data array to be analysed.  In
*        cursor mode (see parameter MODE), the run-time default is the 
*        displayed data, as recorded in the graphics database.  In other
*        modes, there is no run-time default and the user must supply a
*        value.  []
*     NSIM = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of simulations or realisations using the variance
*        information in order to estimate the error in the centroid
*        position.  The uncertainty in the centroid error decreases
*        as one over the square root of NSIM.  The range of acceptable
*        values is 3--10000.  [100]
*     OUTCAT = FILENAME (Write)
*        The output catalogue in which to store the centroided
*        positions.  If a null value (!) is supplied, no output
*        catalogue is produced.  See also parameter CATFRAME.  [!]
*     PLOTSTYLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the style to use when
*        drawing the graphics markers specified by parameter MARK. 
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text 
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files 
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are 
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied.  See section 
*        "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description of the 
*        available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are ignored
*        (no error is reported).  [current value]
*     POSITIVE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE, if array features are positive above the background. 
*        [TRUE]
*     QUIET = LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then the centroid positions are not displayed on the 
*        screen.  Output parameters and files are still created.
*        [FALSE]
*     SEARCH() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Size in pixels of the search box to be used. If only a single
*        value is given, then it will be duplicated to all dimensions
*        so that a square, cube or hypercube region is searched.
*        Each value must be odd and lie in the range 3--51.  [9]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A title to store with the output catalogue specified by
*        parameter OUTCAT, and to display before the centroid positions 
*        are listed.  If a null (!) value is supplied, the title is 
*        taken from any input catalogue specified by parameter INCAT, or
*        is a fixed string including the name of the NDF.  [!]
*     TOLER = _REAL (Read)
*        Accuracy in pixels required in centroiding.  Iterations will
*        stop when the shift between successive centroid positions
*        is less than the accuracy.  The accuracy must lie in the range
*        0.0--2.0.  [0.05]
*     XCEN = LITERAL (Write)
*         The formatted X co-ordinate of the last centroid position, in
*         the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF. 
*     XERR = LITERAL (Write)
*         The error associated with the value written to parameter XCEN.
*     YCEN = LITERAL (Write)
*         The formatted Y co-ordinate of the last centroid position, in
*         the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF. 
*     YERR = LITERAL (Write)
*         The error associated with the value written to parameter YCEN.

*  Examples:
*     centroid cluster cu
*        This finds the centroids in the NDF called cluster via the
*        graphics cursor on the current graphics device.
*     centroid cluster cu search=21 mark=ce plotstyle='colour=red'
*        This finds the centroids in the NDF called cluster via the
*        graphics cursor on the current graphics device.  The search
*        box for the centroid is 21 pixels in each dimension.  The 
*        centroid positions are marked using a red symbol.
*     centroid cluster i "21.7,5007.1"
*        This finds the centroid of the object in the two-dimensional
*        NDF called cluster around the current Frame co-ordinate 
*        (21.7,5007.1).
*     centroid arp244(6,,) i "40,30" toler=0.01
*        This finds the 2-dimensional centroid of the feature near
*        pixel (6,40,30) in the three-dimensional NDF called arp244 
*        (assuming the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF is PIXEL).
*        The centroid must be found to 0.01 pixels.
*     centroid cluster cu xcen=(xp) ycen=(yp)
*        This finds the centroid of an object in the two-dimensional NDF
*        called cluster using a graphics cursor, and writes the
*        centroid co-ordinates to ICL variables XP and YP for use in
*        other applications.
*     centroid cluster mode=file coin=objects.dat logfile=centroids.log
*        This finds the centroids in the NDF called cluster.  The
*        initial positions are given in the text file objects.dat in
*        the current co-ordinate Frame.  A log of the input parameter
*        values, initial and centroid positions is written to the text
*        file centroids.log.
*     centroid cluster mode=cat incat=a outcat=b catframe=ecl
*        This example reads the initial guess positions from the
*        positions list in file a.FIT, and writes the accurate centroid
*        positions to positions list file b.FIT, storing the output 
*        positions in ecliptic co-ordinates.  The input file may, for
*        instance, have been created using the application CURSOR.

*  Notes:
*     -  All positions are supplied and reported in the current 
*     co-ordinate Frame of the NDF.  A description of the co-ordinate
*     Frame being used  is given if parameter DESCRIBE is set to a TRUE
*     value.  Application WCSFRAME can be used to change the current
*     co-ordinate Frame of the NDF before running this application if
*     required.
*     -  In Cursor or Interface mode, only the first 200 supplied 
*     positions will be stored in the output catalogue.  Any further 
*     positions will be displayed on the screen but not stored in the
*     output catalogue.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: PSF, CURSOR, LISTSHOW, LISTMAKE.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  The processing of bad pixels and all non-complex numeric types
*     is supported.

*  Estimation of Centroid Positions:
*     Each centroid position is obtained by projecting the data values
*     within a search box centred on the supplied position, on to each
*     axis in turn.  This forms a set of profiles for the feature, one 
*     for each axis.  An estimate of the background at each point in 
*     these profiles is made and subtracted from the profile.  This 
*     flattens the profile backgrounds, removing any slope in the data. 
*     Once the profiles have been flattened in this way, and estimate of
*     the background noise in each is made.  The centroid of the feature
*     is then found using only the data above the noise level.
*
*     Successive estimates of the centroid position are made by using
*     the previous estimate of the centroid as the initial position for
*     another estimation. This loop is repeated up to a maximum number
*     of iterations, though it normally terminates when a desired
*     accuracy has been achieved. 
*
*     The achieved accuracy is affected by noise, and the presence of
*     non-Gaussian or overlapping features, but typically an accuracy
*     better than 0.1 pixel is readily attainable for stars.  The error
*     in the centroid position may be estimated by a Monte-Carlo method
*     using the data variance to generate realisations of the data about
*     the feature (see parameter CERROR).  Each realisation is processed
*     identically to the actual data, and statistics are formed to
*     derive the standard deviations.
