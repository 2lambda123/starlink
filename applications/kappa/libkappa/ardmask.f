      SUBROUTINE ARDMASK( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARDMASK

*  Purpose:
*     Uses an ARD file to set some pixels of an NDF to be bad.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARDMASK( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This task allows regions of an NDF's to be masked, so
*     that they can (for instance) be excluded from subsequent data
*     processing.  ARD (ASCII Region Definition) descriptions stored in
*     a text file define which pixels of the data array are masked.  An
*     output NDF is created which is the same as the input file except
*     that all pixels specified by the ARD file have been assigned either
*     the bad value or a specified constant value. This value can be
*     assigned to either the inside or the outside of the specified
*     ARD region.
*
*     If positions in the ARD description are given using a co-ordinate
*     system that has one fewer axes than the input NDF, then each plane
*     in the NDF will be masked independently using the supplied ARD
*     description. For instance, if a 2-D ARD description that uses (RA,Dec)
*     to specify positions is used to mask a 3-D (ra,dec,velocity) NDF,
*     then each velocity plane in the NDF will be masked independently.

*  Usage:
*     ardmask in ardfile out

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ARDFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        The name of the ARD file containing a description of the parts
*        of the image to be masked out, i.e. set to bad. The co-ordinate
*        system in which positions within this file are given should be
*        indicated by including suitable COFRAME or WCS statements within
*        the file (see SUN/183), but will default to pixel or current
*        WCS Frame co-ordinates in the absence of any such statements
*        (see parameter DEFPIX). For instance, starting the file with a
*        line containing the text "COFRAME(SKY,System=FK5)" would indicate
*        that positions are specified in RA/DEC (FK5,J2000). The statement
*        "COFRAME(PIXEL)" indicates explicitly that positions are specified
*        in pixel co-ordinates.
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The NDF array component to be masked.  It may be "Data", or
*        "Variance", or "Error", or "All" (where "Error" is equivalent to
*        "Variance"). ["All"]
*     CONST = LITERAL (Given)
*        The constant numerical value to assign to the region, or the string
*        "bad". ["bad"]
*     DEFPIX = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a TRUE value is supplied for DEFPIX, then co-ordinates in
*        the supplied ARD file will be assumed to be pixel coordinates.
*        Otherwise, they are assumed to be in the current WCS co-ordinate
*        system of the supplied NDF. [TRUE]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The name of the source NDF.
*     INSIDE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a TRUE value is supplied, the constant value is assigned to the
*        inside of the region specified by the ARD file. Otherwise, it is
*        assigned to the outside. [TRUE]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The name of the masked NDF.
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output NDF structure.  A null value (!)
*        propagates the title from the input NDF to the output NDF. [!]

*  Examples:
*     ardmask a1060 galaxies.ard a1060_sky title="A1060 galaxies masked"
*        This flags pixels defined by the ARD file galaxies.ard within
*        the NDF called a1060 to create a new NDF called a1060_sky.
*        a1060_sky has a title="A1060 galaxies masked".  This might be
*        to flag the pixels where bright galaxies are located to
*        exclude them from sky-background fitting.
*     ardmask in=ic3374 ardfil=ardfile.txt out=ic3374a
*        This example uses as the source image the NDF called ic3374
*        and sets the pixels specified by the ARD description contained
*        in ardfile.txt to the bad value.  The resultant image is
*        output to the NDF called ic3374a.  The title is unchanged.

*  ASCII-region-definition Descriptors:
*     The ARD file may be created by ARDGEN or written manually.  In the
*     latter case consult SUN/183 for full details of the ARD
*     descriptors and syntax; however, much may be learnt from looking
*     at the ARD files created by ARDGEN and the ARDGEN documentation.
*     There is also a summary with examples in the main body of SUN/95.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: ARDGEN, ARDPLOT, LOOK.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the WCS, AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, HISTORY, and VARIANCE components of an NDF
*     data structure and propagates all extensions.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.
