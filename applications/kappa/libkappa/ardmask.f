      SUBROUTINE ARDMASK( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARDMASK

*  Purpose:
*     Uses an ARD file to set some pixels of an NDF to be bad.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARDMASK( STATUS )

*  Arguments:   
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This task allows regions of an NDF's to be masked, so
*     that they can (for instance) be excluded from subsequent data 
*     processing.  ARD (ASCII Region Definition) descriptions stored in 
*     a text file define which pixels of the data array are masked.  An
*     output NDF is created which is the same as the input file except
*     that all pixels specified by the ARD file have been assigned either
*     the bad value or a specified constant value. This value can be
*     assigned to either the inside or the outside of the specified 
*     ARD region.

*  Usage:
*     ardmask in ardfile out

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ARDFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        The name of the ARD file containing a description of the parts
*        of the image to be masked out, i.e. set to bad. The co-ordinate 
*        system in which positions within this file are given should be 
*        indicated by including suitable COFRAME or WCS statements within 
*        the file (see SUN/183), but will default to pixel co-ordinates
*        in the absence of any such statements. For instance, starting the 
*        file with a line containing the text "COFRAME(SKY,System=FK5)" would
*        indicate that positions are specified in RA/DEC (FK5,J2000). The
*        statement "COFRAME(PIXEL)" indicates explicitly that positions are 
*        specified in pixel co-ordinates. 
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The NDF array component to be masked.  It may be "Data", or
*        "Variance", or "Error" (where "Error" is equivalent to 
*        "Variance"). ["Data"]
*     CONST = LITERAL (Given)
*        The constant numerical value to assign to the region, or the string 
*        "bad". ["bad"]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The name of the source NDF.
*     INSIDE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a TRUE value is supplied, the constant value is assigned to the 
*        inside of the region specified by the ARD file. Otherwise, it is
*        assigned to the outside. [TRUE]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The name of the masked NDF.
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output NDF structure.  A null value (!)
*        propagates the title from the input NDF to the output NDF. [!]

*  Examples:
*     ardmask a1060 galaxies.ard a1060_sky title="A1060 galaxies masked"
*        This flags pixels defined by the ARD file galaxies.ard within
*        the NDF called a1060 to create a new NDF called a1060_sky.
*        a1060_sky has a title="A1060 galaxies masked".  This might be
*        to flag the pixels where bright galaxies are located to
*        exclude them from sky-background fitting.
*     ardmask in=ic3374 ardfil=ardfile.txt out=ic3374a
*        This example uses as the source image the NDF called ic3374
*        and sets the pixels specified by the ARD description contained
*        in ardfile.txt to the bad value.  The resultant image is
*        output to the NDF called ic3374a.  The title is unchanged.

*  ASCII-region-definition Descriptors:
*     The ARD file may be created by ARDGEN or written manually.  In the
*     latter case consult SUN/183 for full details of the ARD
*     descriptors and syntax; however, much may be learnt from looking
*     at the ARD files created by ARDGEN and the ARDGEN documentation.
*     There is also a summary with examples in the main body of SUN/95.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the WCS, AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, HISTORY, and VARIANCE components of an NDF
*     data structure and propagates all extensions.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  Bad pixels and automatic quality masking are supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.

*     08-Jun-1994 (GJP):
*        Original version.
*     1995 June 29 (MJC):
*        Converted for KAPPA use: completed and re-ordered the
*        prologue, lowercase usage and examples, various stylistic
*        changes, standard comment indentation, removed unnecessary
*        status checks and code, allowed all numeric data types, added
*        handling of data co-ordinates and COSYS parameter, propagates
*        other components (axes, units, variance and quality), made to
*        work on n-dimensional NDFs, validated the input text file and
*        removed the need for the leading caret, and made the output
*        TITLE a parameter.
*     1996 July 31 (MJC):
*        Made ARDFILE have type FILENAME for IRAF usage.
*     1997 December 12 (MJC):
*        Sets the bad-pixel flag to indicate the possible presence of
*        bad pixels in the output dataset.
*     5-JUN-1998 (DSB):
*        Added propagation of the WCS component.
*     20-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        Converted to ARD V2 by removing COSYS parameter.
*     25-OCT-2001 (DSB):
*        Modified to make pixel coords the default coord system for ard
*        files.
*     30-NOV-2001 (DSB):
*        Added parameters COMP, CONST and INSIDE.
*     2004 September 3 (TIMJ):
