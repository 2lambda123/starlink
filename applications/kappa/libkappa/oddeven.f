       SUBROUTINE ODDEVEN( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ODDEVEN

*  Purpose:
*     Removes odd-even defects from a one-dimensional NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ODDEVEN( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application forms a smoothed signal for a one-dimensional NDF
*     whose elements have oscillating biases.  It averages the signal 
*     levels of alternating pixels.  Both elements must be good and not
*     deviate from each other by more than a threshold for the averaging 
*     to take place.

*     This application is intended for images exhibiting alternating 
*     patterns in columns or rows, the so called odd-even noise, arising
*     from electronic interference or readout through different 
*     channels.  However, you must supply a vector collapsed along the
*     unaffected axis, such that the vector exhibits the pattern.  See 
*     task COLLAPSE using the Mode or Median estimators.  The smoothed
*     image is then subtracted from the supplied vector to yield the
*     odd-even pattern.

*  Usage:
*     oddeven in out [thresh]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The one-dimensional NDF containing the input array to be
*        filtered.
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The NDF to contain the filtered image.
*     THRESH = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The maximum difference between adjacent elements for the
*        averaging filter to be applied.  This allows anomalous pixels
*        to be excluded.  If null, !, is given, then there is no limit.  
*        [!]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The title of the output NDF.  A null (!) value means using the
*        title of the input NDF.  [!]

*  Examples:
*     oddeven raw clean
*       The one-dimensional NDF called raw is filtered such that
*       adjacent pixels are averaged to form the output NDF call clean.
*     oddeven out=clean in=raw thresh=20
*       As above except only those adjacent pixels whose values differ
*       by no more than 20 are averaged.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: BLOCK, CHPIX, FFCLEAN, GLITCH, ZAPLIN;
*     Figaro: BCLEAN, CLEAN, ISEDIT, TIPPEX.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS, and HISTORY components of an NDF
*     data structure and propagates all extensions.
*     -  VARIANCE is merely propagated.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  Arithmetic
*     is performed using single- or double-precision floating point as
*     appropriate.
