      SUBROUTINE MSTATS( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     MSTATS

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate statistics over a group of data arrays or points.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MSTATS( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)

*  Description:
*     This application calculates cumulative statistics over a group
*     of NDFs.  It can either generate the statistics of each 
*     corresponding pixel in the input array components and output
*     a new NDF with array components containing the result, or
*     calculate statistics at a single point specified in the 
*     current co-ordinate Frame of the input NDFs.
*
*     In array mode (SINGLE=FALSE), statistics are calculated for each
*     pixel in one of the array components (DATA, VARIANCE or QUALITY)
*     accumulated over all the input NDFs and written to an output
*     NDF; each pixel of the output NDF is a result of combination
*     of pixels with the same Pixel co-ordinates in all the input NDFs.
*     There is a selection of statistics available to form the output
*     values.
*
*     The input NDFs must all have the same number of dimensions, but 
*     need not all be the same shape.  The shape of the output NDF can
*     be set to either the intersection or the union of the shapes of
*     the input NDFs using the TRIM parameter.
*
*     In single pixel mode (SINGLE=TRUE) a position in the current
*     co-ordinate Frame of all the NDFs is given, and the value at
*     the pixel covering this point in each of the input NDFs is
*     accumulated to form the results that comprise the mean, variance,
*     and median.  These statistics, and if ILEVEL=3, the value of each 
*     contributing pixel, is reported directly to the user.

*  Usage:
*     mstats in out [estimator]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The NDF array component to be analysed.  It may be "Data",
*        "Quality", "Variance", or "Error" (where "Error" is an
*        alternative to "Variance" and causes the square root of the
*        variance values to be used).  If "Quality" is specified,
*        then the quality values are treated as numerical values (in
*        the range 0 to 255).  In cases other than "Data", which is 
*        always present, a missing component will be treated as having 
*        all pixels set to the `bad' value.  ["Data"]
*     ESTIMATOR = LITERAL (Read)
*        The method to use for estimating the output pixel values from
*        the multiple input pixels at each pixel index.  It
*        can be one of the following options. 
*          "Mean"   -- Mean value
*          "WMean"  -- Weighted mean in wich each data value is weighted
*                      by the reciprocal of the associated variance.  
*          "Mode"   -- Modal value
*          "Median" -- Median value.  Note that this is extremely memory
*                      and CPU intensive for large datasets; use with 
*                      care!  If strange things happen, use "Mean".
*          "Absdev" -- Mean absolute deviation from the unweighted mean.
*          "Comax"  -- Co-ordinate of the maximum value.
*          "Comin"  -- Co-ordinate of the minimum value.
*          "Integ"  -- Integrated value, being the sum of the products 
*                      of the value and pixel width in world
*                      co-ordinates.
*          "Iwc"    -- Intensity-weighted co-ordinate, being the sum of 
*                      each value times its co-ordinate, all divided by
*                      the integrated value (see the "Integ" option).
*          "Iwd"    -- Intensity-weighted dispersion of the
*                      co-ordinate, normalised like "Iwc" by the 
*                      integrated value.
*          "Max"    -- Maximum value.
*          "Min"    -- Minimum value.
*          "Rms"    -- Root-mean-square value.
*          "Sigma"  -- Standard deviation about the unweighted mean.
*          "Sum"    -- The total value.
*
*        Where needed, the co-ordinates are the indices of the input
*        NDFs in the supplied order.  Thus the calculations behave like
*        the NDFs were stacked one upon another to form an extra axis,
*        and that axis had GRID co-ordinates.  Care using wildcards is 
*        necessary, to achieve a specific order, say for a time series,
*        and hence assign the desired co-ordinate for a each NDF.  
*        Indirection through a text file is recommended.
*
*        The selection is restricted if each channel contains three or
*        fewer pixels.  For instance, measures of dispersion like
*        "Sigma" and "Iwd" are meaningless for combining only two NDFs.
*        If you supply an unavailable option, you will be informed,
*        and presented with the available options.   ["Mean"]
*     ILEVEL = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The interactive level of the routine (only used if 
*        SINGLE=TRUE).  If it is 1, nothing is reported on the screen. 
*        If is is 2 or 3, the  statistics are reported.  If is is 3, 
*        the individual pixel values are also reported.  It should lie 
*        between 1 and 3.  [2]
*     IN = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of input NDFs.  They may have different shapes, but 
*        must all have the same number of dimensions.  This should 
*        be given as a comma separated list, in which each list element 
*        can be one of the following.
*
*        - An NDF name, optionally containing wild-cards and/or regular 
*        expressions ("*", "?", "[a-z]" etc.).
*
*        - The name of a text file, preceded by an up-arrow character 
*        "^".  Each line in the text file should contain a 
*        comma-separated list of elements, each of which can in turn be 
*        an NDF name (with optional wild-cards, etc.), or another file 
*        specification (preceded by an up-arrow).  Comments can be 
*        included in the file by commencing lines with a hash character 
*        "#".
*
*        If the value supplied for this parameter ends with a minus
*        sign "-", then the user is re-prompted for further input until
*        a value is given which does not end with a minus sign.  All the
*        images given in this way are concatenated into a single group.
*     MEAN = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        An output parameter to which is written the mean pixel value,
*        if SINGLE=TRUE.
*     MEDIAN = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        An output parameter to which is written the median pixel value,
*        if SINGLE=TRUE.
*     OUT = NDF (Read)
*        The name of an NDF to receive the results.  Each pixel of
*        the DATA (and perhaps VARIANCE) component represents the
*        statistics of the corresponding pixels of the input NDFs.
*        Only used if SINGLE=FALSE.
*     POS = LITERAL (Read)
*        In Single pixel mode (SINGLE=TRUE), this parameter gives the
*        position in the current co-ordinate Frame at which the
*        statistics should be calculated (supplying a colon ":" will 
*        display details of the required co-ordinate Frame).  The 
*        position should be supplied as a list of formatted axis values 
*        separated by spaces or commas.  The pixel covering this point
*        in each input array, if any, will be used.
*     SINGLE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether the statistics should be calculated in Single pixel
*        mode or Array mode.  If SINGLE=TRUE, then the POS parameter
*        will be used to get the point to which the statistics refer,
*        but if SINGLE=FALSE an output NDF will be generated containing
*        the results for all the pixels.  [FALSE]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output NDF.  ["KAPPA - Mstats"]
*     TRIM = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls the shape of the output NDF.  If 
*        TRIM=TRUE, then the output NDF is the shape of the intersection
*        of all the input NDFs, i.e. only pixels which appear in all the
*        input arrays will be represented in the output.  If TRIM=FALSE,
*        the output is the shape of the union of the inputs, i.e. every
*        pixel which appears in the input arrays will be represented in 
*        the output.  [TRUE]
*     VAR = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        An output parameter to which is written the variance of the 
*        pixel values, if SINGLE=TRUE.
*     VARIANCE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        A flag indicating whether a variance array present in the
*        NDF is used to weight the array values while forming the 
*        estimator's statistic, and to derive output variance.  If 
*        VARIANCE is TRUE and all the input NDFs contain a variance 
*        array, this array will be used to define the weights, otherwise
*        all the weights will be set equal.  [TRUE]
*     WLIM = _REAL (Read)
*        If the input NDFs contain bad pixels, then this parameter
*        may be used to determine at a given pixel location the number 
*        of good pixels which must be present within the input NDFs 
*        before a valid output pixel is generated.  It can be used, for 
*        example, to prevent output pixels from being generated in 
*        regions where there are relatively few good pixels to 
*        contribute to the result of combining the input NDFs.
*
*        WLIM specifies the minimum fraction of good pixels which must
*        be present in order to generate a good output pixel.  If this 
*        specified minimum fraction of good input pixels is not present,
*        then a bad output pixel will result, otherwise a good output 
*        value will be calculated.  The value of this parameter should 
*        lie between 0.0 and 1.0 (the actual number used will be rounded
*        up if necessary to correspond to at least one pixel). [0.3]

*  Examples:
*     mstats idat* ostats
*        This calculates the mean of each pixel in the Data arrays of 
*        all the NDFs in the current directory with names that start 
*        "idat", and writes the result in a new NDF called "ostats".  
*        The shape of ostats will be the intersection of the volumes of 
*        all the indat* NDFs.
*     mstats idat* ostats trim=false
*        This does the same as the previous example, except that the
*        output NDF will be the `union' of the volumes of the input
*        NDFs, that is a cuboid with lower bounds as low as the
*        lowest pixel bound of the input NDFs in each dimension and
*        with upper bounds as high as the highest pixel bound in
*        each dimension.
*     mstats idat* ostats variance
*        This is like the first example except variance information
*        present is used to weight the data values.
*     mstats idat* ostats comp=variance variance
*        This does the same as the first example except that statistics
*        are calculated on the VARIANCE components of all the input
*        NDFs.  Thus the pixels of the VARIANCE component of "ostats" 
*        will be the variances of the variances of the input data.
*     mstats m31* single=true pos="0:42:38,40:52:20" 
*        This example is analysing the pixel brightness at the indicated
*        sky position in a number of NDFs whose name start with "m31",
*        which all have SKY as their current co-ordinate Frame.
*        The mean and variance of the pixels at that position in all
*        the NDFs are printed to the screen.
*     mstats m31* single pos="0:42:38,40:52:20" ilevel=3
*        This does the same as the previous example, but also prints
*        out the value of the sampled pixel in each of the NDFs.
*        For those in which the pixel at the selected position is
*        bad or falls outside the NDF, this is also indicated.
*     mstats in="arr1,arr2,arr3" out=middle estimator=median wlim=1.0
*        This example calculates the medians of the DATA components of
*        the three named NDFs and writes them into a new NDF called
*        "middle".  All input values must be good to form a non-bad
*        output value.

*  Notes:
*     -  A warning is issued (at the normal reporting level) whenever 
*     any output values are set bad because there are too few 
*     contributing data values.  This reports the fraction of flagged 
*     output data in comparison with the WLIM parameter.  
*
*     No warning is given when parameter WLIM=0.  Input data containing 
*     only bad values are not counted in the flagged fraction, since no 
*     potential good output value has been lost.

*     CCDPACK: MAKEMOS, MAKECAL, MAKEFLAT.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, VARIANCE,
*     QUALITY, LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS, and HISTORY components of the 
*     first input NDF and propagates all its extensions.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  
*     Calculations are performed using the more appropriate of the
*     data types real or double precision.  If the input NDFs'
*     structures contain values with other data types, then conversion
*     will be performed as necessary.
*     -  Up to six NDF dimensions are supported.
