      SUBROUTINE ARDGEN(STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARDGEN

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a text file describing selected regions of an image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARDGEN( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This is an interactive tool for selecting regions of a displayed
*     image using a cursor, and then storing a description of the
*     selected regions in a text file in the form of an
*     `ARD Description' (see SUN/183).  This text file may subsequently
*     be used in conjunction with packages such as CCDPACK or ESP.
*
*     The application initially obtains a value for the SHAPE parameter
*     and then allows you to identify either one or many regions of the
*     specified shape, dependent on the value of Parameter STARTUP.
*     When the required regions have been identified, a value is
*     obtained for Parameter OPTION, and that value determines what
*     happens next.  Options include obtaining further regions,
*     changing the current region shape, listing the currently defined
*     regions, leaving the application, etc.  Once the selected action
*     has been performed, another value is obtained for OPTION, and
*     this continues until you choose to leave the application.
*
*     Instructions on the use of the cursor are displayed when the
*     application is run.  The points required to define a region of
*     the requested shape are described whenever the current region
*     shape is changed using Parameter SHAPE.  Once the points required
*     to define a region have been given an outline of the entire
*     region is drawn on the graphics device using the pen specified by
*     Parameter PALNUM.
*
*     In the absence of any other information, subsequent application
*     will use the union (i.e. the logical OR) of all the defined
*     regions.  However, regions can be combined in other ways using
*     the COMBINE option (see Parameter OPTION).  For instance, two
*     regions originally defined using the cursor could be replaced by
*     their region of intersection (logical AND), or a single region
*     could be replaced by its own exterior (logical NOT).  Other
*     operators can also be used (see Parameter OPERATOR).

*  Usage:
*     ardgen ardout shape option [device] [startup]
*        { operands=? operator=?
*        { regions=?
*        option

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ARDOUT = FILENAME (Write)
*        Name of the text file in which to store the description of the
*        selected regions.
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The graphics device on which the regions are to be selected.
*        [Current graphics device]
*     OPERANDS() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        A pair of indices for the regions which are to be combined
*        together using the operator specified by Parameter OPERATOR.
*        If the operator is "NOT", then only one region index need be
*        supplied.  Region indices are displayed by the "List" option
*        (see Parameter OPTION).
*     OPERATOR = LITERAL (Read)
*        The operator to use when combining two regions into a single
*        region.  The pixels included in the resulting region depend on
*        which of the following operators is selected.
*
*        - "AND" -- Pixels are included if they are in both of the
*        regions specified by Parameter OPERANDS.
*
*        - "EQV" -- Pixels are included if they are in both or neither
*        of the regions specified by Parameter OPERANDS.
*
*        - "NOT" -- Pixels are included if they are not inside the
*        region specified by Parameter OPERANDS.
*
*        - "OR" -- Pixels are included if they are in either of the
*        regions specified by Parameter OPERANDS.  Note, an OR
*        operator is implicitly assumed to exist between each
*        pair of adjacent regions unless some other operator is
*        specified.
*
*        - "XOR" -- Pixels are included if they are in one, but not
*        both, of the regions specified by Parameter OPERANDS.
*
*     OPTION= LITERAL (Read)
*        A value for this parameter is obtained when you choose to end
*        cursor input (by pressing the relevant button as described
*        when the application starts up).  It determines what to do
*        next.  The following options are available:
*
*        - "Combine" -- Combine two previously defined regions into a
*        single region using a Boolean operator, or invert
*        a previously defined region using a Boolean .NOT.
*        operator.  See parameters OPERANDS and OPERATOR.  The
*        original regions are deleted and the new combined
*        (or inverted) region is added to the end of the
*        list of defined regions.
*
*        - "Delete" -- Delete previously defined regions, see parameter
*        REGIONS.
*
*        - "Draw" -- Draw the outline of the union of one or more
*        previously defined regions, see Parameter REGIONS.
*
*        - "Exit" -- Write out the currently defined regions to a text
*        file and exit the application.
*
*        - "List" -- List the textual descriptions of the currently
*        defined regions on the screen.  Each region is described by an
*        index value, a "keyword" corresponding to the shape, and
*        various arguments describing the extent and position of the
*        shape.  These arguments are described in the "Notes" section
*        below.
*
*        - "Multi" -- The cursor is displayed and you can then identify
*        multiple regions of the current shape, without being
*        re-prompted for OPTION after each one.  These regions are
*        added to the end of the list of currently defined regions.  If
*        the current shape is "Polygon", "Frame" or "Whole" (see
*        Parameter SHAPE) then multiple regions cannot be defined and
*        the selected option automatically reverts to "Single".
*
*        - "Single" -- The cursor is displayed and you can then identify
*        single region of the current shape.  You are re-prompted for
*        Parameter OPTION once you have defined the region.  The
*        identified region is added to the end of the list of currently
*        defined regions.
*
*        - "Shape" -- Change the shape of the regions created by the
*        "Single" and "Multi" options.  This causes a new value for
*        Parameter SHAPE to be obtained.
*
*        - "Style" -- Change the drawing style by providing a new value
*        for Parameter STYLE.
*
*        - "Quit" -- Quit the application without saving the currently
*        defined regions.
*
*        - "Undo" -- Undo the changes made to the list of ARD regions by
*        the previous option. Note, the undo list can contain up to 30
*        entries.  Entries are only stored for options which actually
*        produce a change in the list of regions.
*
*     REGIONS() = LITERAL (Read)
*        The list of regions to be deleted or drawn.  Regions are
*        numbered consecutively from 1 and can be listed using the
*        "List" option (see Parameter OPTION).  Single regions or a set
*        of adjacent regions may be specified, e.g. assigning
*        [4,6-9,12,14-16] will delete regions 4,6,7,8,9,12,14,15,16.
*        (Note that the brackets are required to distinguish this array
*        of characters from a single string including commas.  The
*        brackets are unnecessary when there is only one item.)  The
*        numbers need not be in ascending order.
*
*        If you wish to delete or draw all the regions enter the
*        wildcard *.  5-* will delete or draw from 5 to the last region.
*     SHAPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The shape of the regions to be defined using the cursor.
*        After selecting a new shape, you are immediately requested to
*        identify multiple regions as if "Multi" had been specified for
*        Parameter OPTION.  The currently available shapes are listed
*        below.
*
*        - "Box" -- A rectangular box with sides parallel to the
*        co-ordinate axes, defined by its centre and one of its corners.
*
*        - "Circle" -- A circle, defined by its centre and radius.
*
*        - "Column" -- A single value on Axis 1, spanning all values on
*        Axis 2.
*
*        - "Ellipse" -- An ellipse, defined by its centre, one end of
*        the major axis, and one other point which can be anywhere on
*        the ellipse.
*
*        - "Frame" -- The whole image excluding a border of constant
*        width, defined by a single point on the frame.
*
*        - "Point" -- A single pixel.
*
*        - "Polygon" -- Any general polygonal region, defined by up to
*        200 vertices.
*
*        - "Rectangle" -- A rectangular box with sides parallel to the
*        co-ordinate axes, defined by a pair of diagonally
*        opposite corners.
*
*        - "Rotbox" -- A rotated box, defined by both ends of an edge,
*        and one point on the opposite edge.
*
*        - "Row" -- A single value on Axis 2, spanning all values on
*        Axis 1.
*
*        - "Whole" -- The whole of the displayed image.
*
*     STARTUP = LITERAL (Read)
*        Determines if the application starts up in "Multi" or "Single"
*        mode (see Parameter OPTION). ["Multi"]
*     STYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to
*        use when drawing the regions.
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!)---the initial default---is
*        supplied.  To apply changes of style to only the current
*        invocation, begin these attributes with a plus sign.  A mixture
*        of persistent and temporary style changes is achieved by
*        listing all the persistent attributes followed by a plus sign
*        then the list of temporary attributes.
*
*        See section "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description
*        of the available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are
*        ignored (no error is reported).
*
*        The appearance of the lines forming the edges of each region
*        is controlled by the attributes Colour(Curves), Width(Curves),
*        etc.  The appearance of the vertex markers is controlled by the
*        attributes Colour(Markers), Size(Markers), etc.
*        [current value]
*     UNDO = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Used to confirm that it is OK to proceed with an "Undo" option.
*        The consequences of proceeding are described before the
*        parameter is obtained.

*  Examples:
*     ardgen extract.txt circle exit startup=single
*        This example allows you to create a text file (extract.txt)
*        describing a single circular region of the image displayed on
*        the current graphics device.  The application immediately exits
*        after the region has been identified.  This example may be
*        useful in scripts or command procedures since there is no
*        prompting.

*  Notes:
*     -  An image must previously have been displayed on the graphics
*     device.
*     -  The arguments for the textual description of each shape are as
*     follows :
*
*        - "Box" -- The co-ordinates of the centre, followed by the
*        lengths of the two sides.
*
*        - "Circle" -- The co-ordinates of the centre, followed by the
*        radius.
*
*        - "Column" -- The Axis 1 co-ordinate of the column.
*
*        - "Ellipse" -- The co-ordinates of the centre, followed by the
*        lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, followed by the
*        angle between Axis 1 and the semi-major axis (in radians).
*
*        - "Frame" -- The width of the border.
*
*        - "Point" -- The co-ordinates of the pixel.
*
*        - "Polygon" -- The co-ordinates of each vertex in the order
*        given.
*
*        - "Rectangle" -- The co-ordinates of two diagonally opposite
*        corners.
*
*        - "Rotbox" -- The co-ordinates of the box centre, followed by
*        the lengths of the two sides, followed by the angle between the
*        first side and Axis 1 (in radians).
*
*        - "Row" -- The Axis 2 co-ordinate of the row.
*
*        - "Whole" -- No arguments.
*
*      -  The shapes are defined within the current co-ordinate Frame of
*      the displayed NDF.  For instance, if the current co-ordinate
*      Frame of the displayed NDF is RA/DEC, then "COLUMN" regions will
*      be curves of constant DEC, "ROW" regions will be curves of
*      constant RA (assuming Axis 1 is RA and Axis 2 is DEC), straight
*      lines will correspond to geodesics, etc. Numerical values will be
*      stored in the output text file in the current coordinate Frame of
*      the NDF.  WCS information will also be stored in the output text
*      file allowing the stored positions to be converted to other
*      systems (pixel co-ordinates, for instance).
