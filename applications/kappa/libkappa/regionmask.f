      SUBROUTINE REGIONMASK( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     REGIONMASK

*  Purpose:
*     Applies a mask to a region of an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL REGIONMASK( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine masks out a region of an NDF by setting pixels to
*     the bad value, or to a specified constant value. The region to
*     be masked is specified within a text file (see Parameter REGION)
*     that should contain a description of the region in the form of an
*     "AST Region". This is the system used by the AST library for
*     describing regions (see SUN/211 or SUN/210). Such text files can,
*     for instance, be created using the Starlink ATOOLS package (a
*     high-level interface to the facilities of the AST library).

*  Usage:
*     regionmask in region out

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     CONST = LITERAL (Given)
*        The constant numerical value to assign to the region, or the
*        string "Bad".  ["Bad"]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The name of the input NDF.
*     INSIDE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a TRUE value is supplied, the constant value is assigned
*        to the inside of the region. Otherwise, it is assigned to the
*        outside.  [TRUE]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The name of the output NDF.
*     REGION = FILENAME (Read)
*        The name of the text file containing a text dump of an AST
*        Region. Any sub-class of Region may be supplied (e.g. Box,
*        Polygon, CmpRegion, Prism, etc.). If the axes spanned by this
*        Region are not the same as those of the current WCS Frame in
*        the input NDF, an attempt will be made to create an equivalent
*        new Region that does match the current WCS Frame. An error will
*        be reported if this is not possible.

*  Examples:
*     regionmask a1060 galaxies.txt a1060_sky
*        This copies input NDF a1060 to the output NDF a1060_sky,
*        setting pixels bad if they are contained within the Region
*        specified in text file "galaxies.txt".

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: ARDMASK;
*     ATOOLS: ASTBOX, ASTCMPREGION, ASTELLIPSE, ASTINTERVAL, ASTPOLYGON.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the WCS, AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, HISTORY, and VARIANCE components of an NDF
*     data structure and propagates all extensions.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.
