      SUBROUTINE WIENER( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     WIENER

*  Purpose:
*     Applies a Wiener filter to a 1- or 2-dimensional array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL WIENER( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application filters the supplied 1- or 2-dimensional array
*     using a Wiener filter.  It takes an array holding observed data
*     and another holding a Point-Spread Function as input and produces
*     an output restored array with potentially higher resolution and
*     lower noise.  Generally superior results can be obtained using
*     applications MEM2D or LUCY, but at the cost of much more
*     processing time.
*
*     The Wiener filter attempts to minimise the mean squared
*     difference between the undegraded image and the restored image.
*     To do this it needs to know the power spectrum of the undegraded
*     image (i.e. the power at each spatial frequency before the
*     instrumental blurring and the addition of noise).  Obviously,
*     this is not usually available, and instead the power spectrum of
*     some other image must be used (the `model' image).  The idea is
*     that a model image should be chosen for which there is some a
*     priori reason for believing it to have a power spectrum similar
*     to the undegraded image.  Many different suggestions have been
*     made for the best way to make this choice and the literature
*     should be consulted for a detailed discussion (for instance, see
*     the paper "Wiener Restoration of HST Images: Signal Models and
*     Photometric Behavior" by I.C. Busko in the proceedings of the
*     first Annual Conference  on Astronomical Data Analysis Software
*     and Systems, Tucson).  By default, this application uses a
*     `white' model image, i.e. one in which there is equal power at
*     all spatial frequencies.  The default value for this constant
*     power is the mean power per pixel in the input image.  There is
*     also an option to use the power spectrum of a supplied model
*     image.
*
*     The filter also depends on a model of the noise in the supplied
*     image.  This application assumes that the noise is 'white' and is
*     constant across the image.  You can specify the noise power
*     to use.  If a noise power of zero is supplied, then the Wiener
*     filter just becomes a normal inverse filter which will tend to
*     amplify noise in the supplied image.
*
*     The filtering is done by multiplying the Fourier transform of the
*     supplied image by the Fourier transform of the filter function.
*     The output image is then created by taking the inverse Fourier
*     transform of the product.  The Fourier transform of the filter
*     function is given by:
*
*                 *
*                H
*          -------------
*             2      Pn
*          |H|   +  ----
*                    Pg 
*
*     where H is the Fourier transform of the supplied Point-Spread
*     Function, Pn is the noise power, Pg is the power in the model
*     image, and the asterisk represents complex conjugation.  If the
*     supplied model includes noise (as indicated by parameter QUIET)
*     then Pn is subtracted from Pg before evaluating the above
*     expression.
      
*  Usage:
*     wiener in psf out xcentre ycentre

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF containing the observed data.  This image may
*        contain bad values, in which case the bad values will be
*        replaced by zero before applying the filter.  The resulting
*        filtered image is normalised by dividing each pixel value by
*        the corresponding weight of the good input pixels.  These
*        weights are found by filtering a mask image which holds the
*        value one at every good input pixel, and zero at every bad
*        input pixel.
*     MODEL = NDF (Read)
*        An NDF containing an image to use as the model for the power
*        spectrum of the restored image.  Any bad values in this image
*        are replaced by the mean of the good values.  If a null value
*        is supplied then the model power spectrum is taken to be
*        uniform with a value specified by parameter PMODEL. [!]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The restored output array.  An extension named WIENER is added
*        to the output NDF to indicate that the image was created by
*        this application (see parameter QUIET). 
*     PMODEL = _REAL (Read)
*        The mean power per pixel in the model image.  This parameter
*        is only accessed if a null value is supplied for parameter
*        MODEL.  If a value is obtained for PMODEL then the model image
*        is assumed to have the specified constant power at all spatial
*        frequencies.  The run-time default is the mean power per pixel
*        in the input image. []
*     PNOISE = _REAL (Read)
*        The mean noise power per pixel in the observed data.  For
*        Gaussian noise this is equal to the variance.  The run-time
*        default is an estimate of the noise variance based on the
*        difference between adjacent pixel values in the observed
*        data. []
*     PSF = NDF (Read)
*        An NDF holding an estimate of the Point-Spread Function (PSF)
*        of the input array.  This could, for instance, be produced
*        using the KAPPA application "PSF".  There should be no bad
*        pixels in the PSF otherwise an error will be reported.  The
*        PSF can be centred anywhere within the array, but the location
*        of the centre must be specified using parameters XCENTRE and
*        YCENTRE.  The PSF is assumed to have the value zero outside
*        the supplied NDF.
*     QUIET = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This specifies whether or not the image given for parameter
*        MODEL (or the value given for parameter PMODEL), includes
*        noise.  If the model does not include any noise then a TRUE
*        value should be supplied for QUIET.  If there is any noise in
*        the model then QUIET should be supplied FALSE.  The run-time
*        default is FALSE, unless the image given for parameter MODEL
*        was created by a previous run of WIENER (as indicated by the
*        presence of a WIENER extension in the NDF), in which case the
*        run time default is TRUE (i.e. the previous run of WIENER is
*        assumed to have removed the noise). []
*     THRESH = _REAL (Read)
*        The fraction of the PSF peak amplitude at which the extents of
*        the PSF are determined.  These extents are used to derive the
*        size of the margins that pad the supplied input array.  Lower
*        values of THRESH will result in larger margins being used.
*        THRESH must be positive and less than 0.5.  [0.0625]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A title for the output NDF.  A null (!) value means using the
*        title of the input NDF. [!]
*     WLIM = _REAL (Read)
*        If the input array contains bad values, then this parameter
*        may be used to determine the minimum weight of good input
*        values required to create a good output value.  It can be
*        used, for example, to prevent output pixels from being
*        generated in regions where there are relatively few good input
*        values to contribute to the restored result.  It can also be
*        used to `fill in' small areas (i.e. smaller than the PSF) of
*        bad pixels.
*        
*        The numerical value given for WLIM specifies the minimum total
*        weight associated with the good pixels in a smoothing box
*        required to generate a good output pixel (weights for each
*        pixel are defined by the normalised PSF).  If this specified
*        minimum weight is not present, then a bad output pixel will
*        result, otherwise a smoothed output value will be calculated.
*        The value of this parameter should lie between 0.0 and
*        1.0.  WLIM=0 causes a good output value to be created even if
*        there is only one good input value, whereas WLIM=1 causes a
*        good output value to be created only if all input values are
*        good. [0.001]
*     XCENTRE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The x pixel index of the centre of the PSF within the supplied
*        PSF array.  The suggested default is the middle pixel (rounded
*        down if there are an even number of pixels per line).
*     YCENTRE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The y pixel index of the centre of the PSF within the supplied
*        PSF array.  The suggested default is the middle line (rounded
*        down if there are an even number of lines).

*  Examples:
*     wiener cenA star cenA_hires 11 13
*        This example deconvolves the array in the NDF called cenA,
*        putting the resulting array in the NDF called cenA_hires.
*        The PSF is defined by the array in NDF star, and the centre
*        of the PSF is at pixel (11,13).
*     wiener cenA star cenA_hires 11 13 pnoise=0
*        This example performs the same function as the previous
*        example, except that the noise power is given as zero.  This
*        causes the Wiener filter to reduce to a standard inverse
*        filter, which will result in more high frequencies being
*        present in the restored image.
*     wiener cenA star cenA_hires 11 13 model=theory quiet
*        This example performs the same function as the first example,
*        except that the power spectrum of the restored image is
*        modelled on that of NDF theory, which may for instance
*        contain a theoretical model of the object in NDF cenA,
*        together with a simulated star field.  The parameter QUIET is
*        set to a TRUE value to indicate that the theoretical model
*        contains no noise.

*  Notes:
*     - The convolutions required by the Wiener filter are performed by
*     the multiplication of Fourier transforms.  The supplied input
*     array is extended by a margin along each edge to avoid problems
*     of wrap-around between opposite edges of the array.  The width of
*     this margin is about equal to the width of the significant part
*     of the PSF (as determined by parameter THRESH).  The application
*     displays the width of these margins.  The margins are filled by
*     replicating the edge pixels from the supplied input NDFs.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: FOURIER, LUCY, MEM2D.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS and HISTORY components of the
*     input NDF and propagates all extensions.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  Arithmetic
*     is performed using single-precision floating point.
