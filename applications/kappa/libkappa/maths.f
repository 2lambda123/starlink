      SUBROUTINE MATHS( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     MATHS

*  Purpose:
*     Evaluates mathematical expressions applied to NDF data structures.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MATHS( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application allows arithmetic and mathematical functions to
*     be applied pixel-by-pixel to a number of NDF data structures and
*     constants so as to produce a new NDF.  The operations to be
*     performed are specified using a Fortran-like mathematical
*     expression.  Up to 26 each input NDF data and variance arrays, 26
*     parameterised `constants', and pixel and data co-ordinates along
*     up to 7 dimensions may be combined in wide variety of ways using
*     this application.  The task can also calculate variance estimates
*     for the result when there is at least one input NDF array.

*  Usage:
*     maths exp out ia-iz=? va-vz=? fa-fz=? pa-pz=? lbound=? ubound=?

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     EXP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The mathematical expression to be evaluated for each NDF
*        pixel, e.g. "(IA-IB+2)*PX".  In this expression, input NDFs are
*        denoted by the variables IA, IB, ... IZ, while constants may
*        either be given literally or represented by the variables PA,
*        PB, ...  PZ.  Values for those NDFs and constants which appear
*        in the expression will be requested via the application's
*        parameter of the same name.
*
*        Fortran-77 syntax is used for specifying the expression, which
*        may contain the usual intrinsic functions, plus a few extra
*        ones. An appendix in SUN/61 gives a full description of the
*        syntax used and an up to date list of the functions available.
*        The expression may be up to 132 characters long and is case
*        insensitive.
*     FA-FZ = LITERAL (Read)
*        These parameters supply the values of `sub-expressions' used
*        in the expression EXP.  Any of the 26 (FA, FB, ... FZ) may
*        appear; there is no restriction on order.  These parameters
*        should be used when repeated expressions are present in
*        complex expressions, or to shorten the value of EXP to fit
*        within the 132-character limit.  Sub-expressions may contain
*        references to other sub-expressions and constants (PA-PZ).  An
*        example of using sub-expressions is:
*           EXP > PA*ASIND(FA/PA)*XA/FA
*           FA > SQRT(XA*XA+XB*YB)
*           PA > 10.1
*        where the parameter name is to the left of > and its value is
*        to the right of the >.
*     IA-IZ = NDF (Read)
*        The set of 26 parameters named IA, IB, ... IZ is used to
*        obtain the input NDF data structure(s) to which the
*        mathematical expression is to be applied.  Only those
*        parameters which actually appear in the expression are used,
*        and their values are obtained in alphabetical order.  For
*        instance, if the expression were "SQRT(IB+IA)", then the
*        parameters IA and IB would be used (in this order) to obtain
*        the two input NDF data structures.
*     LBOUND( ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Lower bounds of new NDF, if LIKE=! and there is no input NDF
*        referenced in the expression.  The number of values required
*        is the number of pixel co-ordinate axes in the expression.
*     LIKE = NDF (Read)
*        An optional template NDF which, if specified, will be used to
*        define bounds and data type of the new NDF, when the expression
*        does not contain a reference to an NDF.  If a null response
*        (!) is given the bounds are obtained via parameters LBOUND
*        and UBOUND, and the data type through parameter TYPE. [!]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        Output NDF to contain the result of evaluating the expression
*        at each pixel.
*     PA-PZ = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The set of 26 parameters named PA, PB, ... PZ is used to
*        obtain the numerical values of any parameterised `constants'
*        which appear in the expression being evaluated.  Only those
*        parameters which actually appear in the expression are used,
*        and their values are obtained in alphabetical order.  For
*        instance, if the expression were "PT*SIN(IA/PS)", then the
*        parameters PS and PT (in this order) would be used to obtain
*        numerical values for substitution into the expression at the
*        appropriate points.
*
*        These parameters are particularly useful for supplying the
*        values of constants when writing procedures, where the
*        constant may be determined by a command-language variable, or
*        when the constant is stored in a data structure such as a
*        global parameter.  In other cases, constants should normally be
*        given literally as part of the expression, as in "IZ**2.77".
*     QUICK = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Specifies the method by which values for the VARIANCE
*        component of the output NDF are calculated.  The algorithm used
*        to determine these values involves perturbing each of the
*        input NDF data arrays in turn by an appropriate amount, and
*        then combining the resulting output perturbations.  If QUICK
*        is set to TRUE, then each input data array will be perturbed
*        once, in the positive direction only.  If QUICK is set to
*        FALSE, then each will be perturbed twice, in the positive and
*        negative directions, and the maximum resultant output
*        perturbation will be used to calculate the output variance.
*        The former approach (the normal default) executes more
*        quickly, but the latter is likely to be more accurate in cases
*        where the function being evaluated is highly non-linear,
*        and/or the errors on the data are large.  [TRUE]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Value for the title of the output NDF.  A null value will cause
*        the title of the (alphabetically) first input NDF to be used
*        instead. [!]
*     TYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Data type for the new NDF, if LIKE=! and no input NDFs are
*        referenced in the expression.  It must be one either
*        "_DOUBLE" or "_REAL".
*     UBOUND( ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Upper bounds of new NDF, if LIKE=! and there is no input NDF
*        referenced in the expression.  These must not be smaller
*        than the corresponding LBOUND.  The number of values required
*        is the number of pixel co-ordinate axes in the expression.
*     UNITS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Specifies whether the UNITS component of the (alphabetically)
*        first input NDF or the template NDF will be propagated to the
*        output NDF.  By default this component is not propagated since,
*        in most cases, the units of the output data will differ from
*        those of any of the input data structures.  In simple cases,
*        however, the units may be unchanged, and this parameter then
*        allows the UNITS component to be preserved.  This parameter is
*        ignored if the expression does not contain a token to at least
*        one input NDF structure and LIKE=!.  [FALSE]
*     VA-VZ = NDF (Read)
*        The set of 26 parameters named VA, VB, ... VZ is used to
*        obtain the input NDF variance array(s) to which the
*        mathematical expression is to be applied.  The variance VA
*        corresponds to the data array specified by parameter IA, and
*        so on.  Only those parameters which actually appear in the
*        expression, and do not have their corresponding data-array
*        parameter IA-IZ present, have their values obtained in
*        alphabetical order.  For instance, if the expression were
*        "IB+SQRT(VB+VA)", then the parameters VA and IB would be used
*        (in this order) to obtain the two input NDF data structures.
*        The first would use just the variance array, whilst the second
*        would read both data and variance arrays.
*     VARIANCE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Specifies whether values for the VARIANCE component of the
*        output NDF should be calculated.  If this parameter is set to
*        TRUE (the normal default), then output variance values will be
*        calculated if any of the input NDFs contain variance
*        information.  Any which do not are regarded as having zero
*        variance.  Variance calculations will normally be omitted only
*        if none of the input NDFs contain variance information.
*        However, if VARIANCE is set to FALSE, then calculation of
*        output variance values will be disabled under all
*        circumstances, with a consequent saving in execution time.
*        This parameter is ignored if the expression does not contain
*        a token to at least one input NDF structure. [TRUE]

*  Examples:
*     maths "ia-1" dat2 ia=dat1
*        The expression "ia-1" is evaluated to subtract 1 from each
*        pixel of the input NDF referred to as IA, whose values reside
*        in the data structure dat1.  The result is written to the NDF
*        structure dat2.
*     maths "(ia-ib)/ic" ia=data ib=back ic=flat out=result units
*        The expression "(ia-ib)/ic" is evaluated to remove a
*        background from an image and to divide it by a flat-field.
*        All the images are held in NDF data structures, the input
*        image being obtained from the data structure data, the
*        background image from back and the flat-field from flat.  The
*        result is written to the NDF structure result.  The data units
*        are unchanged and are therefore propagated to the output NDF.
*     maths "-2.5*log10(ii)+25.7" ii=file1 out=file2
*        The expression "-2.5*log10(ii)+25.7" is evaluated to convert
*        intensity measurements into magnitudes, including a zero
*        point.  Token II represents the input measurements held in the
*        NDF structure file1.  The result is written to the NDF
*        structure file2.  If file1 contains variance values, then
*        corresponding variance values will also be calculated for
*        file2.
*     maths exp="pa*exp(ia+pb)" out=outfile pb=13.7 novariance
*        The expression "pa*exp(ia+pb)" is evaluated with a value of
*        13.7 for the constant PB, and output is written to the NDF
*        structure outfile.  The input NDF structure to be used for
*        token IA and the value of the other numerical constant PA will
*        be prompted for.  NOVARIANCE has been specified so that output
*        variance values will not be calculated.
*     maths exp="mod(XA,32)+mod(XB,64)" out=outfile like=comwest
*        The expression "mod(XA,32)+mod(XB,64)" is evaluated, and
*        output is written to the NDF structure outfile.  The output
*        NDF inherits the shape, bounds, and other properties (except the
*        variance) of the NDF called comwest.  The data type of outfile
*        is _REAL unless comwest has type _DOUBLE.  XA and XB represent
*        the pixel co-ordinates along the x and y axes respectively.
*     maths "xf*xf+0*xa" ord2 lbound=[-20,10] ubound=[20,50]
*        The expression "xf*xf+0*xa" is evaluated, and output is
*        written to the NDF structure ord2.  The output NDF has data
*        type _REAL, is two-dimensional with bounds -20:20, 10:50.  The
*        XA is needed to indicate that XF represents pixel co-ordinates
*        along the y axis.
*     maths "xa/max(1,xb)+sqrt(va)" ord2 va=fuzz title="Fuzz correction"
*        The expression "xa/max(1,xb)+sqrt(va)" is evaluated, and output
*        is written to the NDF structure ord2.  Token VA represents the
*        input variance array held in the NDF structure fuzz.  The
*        output NDF inherits the shape, bounds, and other properties of
*        fuzz.  The title of ord2 is "Fuzz correction".  The data type
*        of ord2 is _REAL unless fuzz has type _DOUBLE.  XA and XB
*        represent the pixel co-ordinates along the x and y axes
*        respectively.

*  Notes:
*     -  The alphabetically first input NDF is regarded as the primary
*     input dataset.  NDF components whose values are not changed by
*     this application will be propagated from this NDF to the output.
*     The same propagation rules apply to the LIKE template NDF,
*     except that the output NDF does have inherit any variance
*     information.
*     -  There are additional tokens which can appear in the expression.
*
*     The set of 7 tokens named CA, CB, ... CG is used to obtain the
*     data co-ordinates from the primary input NDF data structure.  Any
*     of the 7 parameters may appear in the expression.  The order
*     defines which axis is which, so for example, "2*CF+CB*CB" means
*     the first-axis data co-ordinates squared, plus twice the
*     co-ordinates along the second axis.  There must be at least one
*     input NDF in the expression to use the CA-CG tokens, and it must
*     have dimensionality of at least the number of CA-CG tokens given.
*
*     The set of 7 tokens named XA, XB, ... XG is used to obtain the
*     pixel co-ordinates from the primary input NDF data structure.  Any
*     of the 7 parameters may appear in the expression.  The order
*     defines which axis is which, so for example, "SQRT(XE)+XC" means
*     the first-axis pixel co-ordinates plus the square root of the
*     co-ordinates along the second axis.  Here no input NDF need be
*     supplied.  In this case the dimensionality of the output NDF is equal to the
*     number of XA-XG tokens in the expression.  However, if there is at
*     least one NDF in the expression, there should not be more XA-XG
*     tokens than the dimensionality of the output NDF (given as the
*     intersection of the bounds of the input NDFs).
*     -  If illegal arithmetic operations (e.g. division by zero, or
*     square root of a negative number) are attempted, then a bad pixel
*     will be generated as a result.  (However, the infrastructure
*     software that detects this currently does not work on OSF/1
*     systems, and therefore MATHS will crash in this circumstance.)
*     -  All arithmetic performed by this application is floating
*     point.  Single-precision will normally be used, but
*     double-precision will be employed if any of the input NDF arrays
*     has a numeric type of _DOUBLE.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: CREFRAME, SETAXIS, and numerous arithmetic tasks; Figaro:
*     numerous arithmetic tasks.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     VARIANCE, LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS and HISTORY components of the
*     input NDFs.  HISTORY and extensions are propagated from both the
*     primary NDF and template NDF.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.
*     -  NDFs with any number of dimensions can be processed.  The NDFs
*     supplied as input need not all be the same shape.

*  Calculating Variance:
*     The algorithm used to calculate output variance values is
*     general-purpose and will give correct results for any reasonably
*     well-behaved mathematical expression.  However, this application
*     as a whole, and the variance calculations in particular, are
*     likely to be less efficient than a more specialised application
*     written knowing the form of the mathematical expression in
*     advance.  For simple operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) the
*     use of other applications (ADD, SUB, etc.) is therefore
*     recommended, particularly if variance calculations are required.
*
*     The main value of the variance-estimation algorithm used here
*     arises when the expression to be evaluated is too complicated, or
*     too infrequently used, to justify the work of deriving a direct
*     formula for the variance.  It is also of value when the data
*     errors are especially large, so that the linear approximation
*     normally used in error analysis breaks down.
*
*     There is no variance processing when there are no tokens for
*     input NDF structures.

*  Timing:
*     If variance calculations are not being performed, then the time
*     taken is approximately proportional to the number of NDF pixels
*     being processed.  The execution time also increases with the
*     complexity of the expression being evaluated, depending in the
*     usual way on the nature of any arithmetic operations and
*     intrinsic functions used. If certain parts of the expression will
*     often give rise to illegal operations (resulting in bad pixels),
*     then execution time may be minimised by placing these operations
*     near the beginning of the expression, so that later parts may not
*     need to be evaluated.
*
*     If output variance values are being calculated and the QUICK
*     parameter is set to TRUE, then the execution time will be
*     multiplied by an approximate factor (N+1), where N is the number
*     of input NDFs which contain a VARIANCE component.  If QUICK is set
*     to FALSE, then the execution time will be multiplied by an
*     approximate factor (2N+1).

*     1989 December 21 (MJC):
*        Workspace managed by AIF_TEMP.
*     1990 June 28 (RFWS):
*        Substantial re-write to use the NDF_ access routines and to
*        calculate output variance values.
*     1990 August 7 (RFWS):
*        Fixed bug in data type of the PARVAL variable.
*     1995 September 18 (MJC):
*        Added FA-FZ, LBOUND, LIKE, PA-PZ, TYPE, UBOUND, VA-VZ
*        parameters, Usage, Related Applications, and additional
*        examples.  Enabled use of variance and co-ordinates in the
