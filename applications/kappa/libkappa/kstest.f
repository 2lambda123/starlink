      SUBROUTINE KSTEST( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KSTEST

*  Purpose:
*     Compares data sets using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KSTEST( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status

*  Description:
*     This routine reads in a data array and performs a two sided
*     Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the vectorised data.  It does this in
*     two ways:
*
*       1) If only one dataset is to be tested the data array is
*          divided into subsamples.  First it compares subsample 1 with
*          subsample 2, if they are thought to be from the same sample
*          they are concatenated.  This enlarged sample is then
*          compared with subsample 3 etc., concatenating if consistent,
*          until no more subsamples remain.
*
*       2) If more than one dataset is specified, the datasets are
*          compared to the reference dataset in turn.  If the
*          probability the two are from the same sample is greater than
*          the specified confidence level, the datasets are
*          concatenated, and the next sample is tested against this
*          enlarged reference dataset.
*
*     The probability and maximum separation of the cumulative
*     distribution function is displayed for each comparison (at the
*     normal reporting level).  The mean value of the consistent data
*     and its error are also reported.  In all cases the consistent
*     data can be output to a new dataset.  The statistics and
*     probabilities are written to results parameters.

*  Usage:
*     kstest in out [limit]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the NDF array component to be tested for
*        consistency: "Data", "Error", "Quality" or "Variance" (where
*        "Error" is the alternative to "Variance" and causes the square
*        root of the variance values to be taken before performing the
*        comparisons).  If "Quality" is specified, then the quality
*        values are treated as numerical values (in the range 0 to
*        255).  ["Data"]
*     DIST() = _REAL (Write)
*        Maximum separation found in the cumulative distributions for
*        each comparison subsample.  Note that it excludes the
*        reference dataset.
*     ERRMEAN = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        Error in the mean value of the consistent data.
*     FILES() = LITERAL (Write)
*        The names of the datasets intercompared.  The first is the
*        reference dataset.
*     LIMIT = _REAL (Read)
*        Confidence level at which samples are thought to be
*        consistent.  This must lie in the range 0 to 1. [0.05]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        The names of the NDFs to be tested.  If just one dataset is
*        supplied, it is divided into subsamples, which are compared
*        (see parameter NSAMPLE).  When more than one dataset is
*        provided, the first becomes the reference dataset to which all
*        the remainder are compared.
*
*        It may be a list of NDF names or direction specifications
*        separated by commas.  If a list is supplied on the command
*        line, the list must be enclosed in double quotes.  NDF names
*        may include the regular expressions ("*", "?", "[a-z]" etc.).
*        Indirection may occur through text files (nested up to seven
*        deep).  The indirection character is "^".  If extra prompt
*        lines are required, append the continuation character "-" to
*        the end of the line.  Comments in the indirection file begin
*        with the character "#".
*     MEAN = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        Mean value of the consistent data.
*     NKEPT = _INTEGER (Write)
*        Number of consistent data.
*     NSAMPLE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of the subsamples into which to divide the reference
*        dataset.  This parameter is only requested when a single NDF
*        is to be analysed, i.e. when only one dataset name is supplied
*        via parameter IN.  The allowed range is 2 to 20.  [3]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        Output 1-dimensional NDF to which the consistent data is
*        written.  A null value (!)---the suggested default---prevents
*        creation of this output dataset.
*     PROB() = _REAL (Write)
*        Probability that each comparison subsample is drawn from the
*        same sample.  Note that this excludes the reference sample.
*     SIGMA = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        Standard deviation of the consistent data.

*  Examples:
*     kstest arlac accept
*        This tests the NDF called arlac for self-consistency at the 95%
*        confidence level using three subsamples.  No output dataset is
*        created.
*
*        The following applies to all the examples.  If the reference
*        dataset and a comparison subsample are consistent, the two
*        merge to form an expanded reference dataset, which is then
*        used for the next comparison.  Details of the comparisons are
*        presented.
*     kstest arlac arlac_filt 0.10 nsample=10
*        As above except data are retained if they exceed the 90%
*        probability level, the comparisons are made with ten
*        subsamples, and the consistent data are written to the
*        one-dimensional NDF called arlac_filt.
*     kstest in="ref,obs*" comp=v out=master
*        This compares the variance in the NDF called ref with that in
*        a series of other NDFs whose names begin "obs".  The variance
*        consistent with the reference dataset are written to the data
*        array in the NDF called master.  To be consistent, they must be
*        the same at 95% probability.
*     kstest "ref,^96lc.lis,obs*" master comp=v
*        As the previous example, except the comparison files include
*        those listed in the text file 96lc.lis.

*  Notes:
*     - The COMP array MUST exist in each NDF to be compared.  The
*     COMP array becomes the data array in the output dataset.  When
*     COMP="Data", the variance values corresponding to consistent data
*     are propagated to the output dataset.
*     - Pixel bounds are ignored for the comparisons.
*     - The internal comparison of a single dataset follows the method
*     outlined in Hughes D., 1993, JCMT-UKIRT Newsletter, #4, p32.
*     - The maximum number of files is 20.

*  Algorithm:
*     - Read in one or more datasets
*     - If one NDF split into subsamples and compare internally
*     - If more than one NDF compare directly and return statistic
*     - Write output file of consistent data

*  Implementation Status:
*     - This routine correctly processes DATA, VARIANCE, HISTORY, LABEL,
*     TITLE, and UNITS components, and propagates all extensions.  AXIS
*     information is lost.  Propagation is from the reference dataset.
*     - Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     - All numeric data types are supported, however, processing uses
*     the _REAL data type, and the output dataset has this type.
