      SUBROUTINE LUCY( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     LUCY

*  Purpose:
*     Performs a Richardson-Lucy deconvolution of a 1- or 2-dimensional
*     array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LUCY( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application deconvolves the supplied 1- or 2-dimensional
*     array using the Richardson-Lucy (R-L) algorithm.  It takes an
*     array holding observed data and another holding a Point-Spread
*     Function (PSF) as input and produces an output array with higher
*     resolution.  The algorithm is iterative, each iteration producing
*     a new estimate of the restored array which (usually) fits the
*     observed data more closely than the previous estimate (in the
*     sense that simulated data generated from the restored array is
*     closer to the observed data).  The closeness of the fit is
*     indicated after each iteration by a normalised chi-squared value
*     (i.e. the chi-squared per pixel).  The algorithm terminates when
*     the normalised chi-squared given by parameter AIM is reached, or
*     the maximum number of iterations given by parameter NITER have
*     been performed.  The current estimate of the restored array is
*     then written to the output NDF.
*
*     Before the first iteration, the restored array is initialised
*     either to the array given by parameter START, or, if no array is
*     given, to the difference between the mean value in the input data
*     array and the mean value in the background (specified by
*     parameters BACK and BACKVAL).  Simulated data is then created from
*     this trial array by smoothing it with the supplied PSF, and then
*     adding the background on.  The chi-squared value describing the
*     deviation of this simulated data from the observed data is then
*     found and displayed.  If the required chi-squared is not reached
*     by this simulated data, the first iteration commences, which
*     consists of creating a new version of the restored array and then
*     creating new simulated data from this new restored array (the
*     corresponding chi-squared value is displayed).  Repeated
*     iterations are performed until the required chi-squared is
*     reached, or the iteration limit is reached.  The new version of
*     the restored array is created as follows.
*
*        1 - A correction factor is found for each data value.  This is
*        the ratio of the observed data value to the simulated data
*        value.  An option exists to use the Snyder modification as
*        used by the LUCY program in the STSDAS package within IRAF.
*        With this option selected, the variance of the observed data
*        value is added to both the numerator and the denominator when
*        finding the correction factors.
*
*        2 - These correction factors are mapped into an array by
*        smoothing the array of correction factors with the transposed
*        PSF.
*
*        3 - The current version of the restored array is multiplied by
*        this correction factor array to produce the new version of the
*        restored array.
*
*     For further background to the algorithm, see L. B. Lucy,
*     Astron.J. 1974, Vol 79, No. 6.

*  Usage:
*     lucy in psf out [aim]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AIM = _REAL (Read)
*        The chi-squared value at which the algorithm should terminate.
*        Smaller values of AIM will result in higher apparent resolution
*        in the output array but will also cause noise in the observed
*        data to be interpreted as real structure.  Small values will
*        require larger number of iterations, so NITER may need to be
*        given a larger value.  Very-small values may be completely
*        un-achievable, indicated by chi-squared not decreasing (or
*        sometimes increasing) between iterations.  Larger values will
*        result in smoother output arrays with less noise.  [1.0]
*     BACK = NDF (Read)
*        An NDF holding the background value for each observed data
*        value.  If a null value is supplied, a constant background
*        value given by parameter BACKVAL is used. [!]
*     BACKVAL = _REAL (Read)
*        The constant background value to use if BACK is given a null
*        value. [0.0]
*     CHIFAC = _REAL (Read)
*        The normalised chi-squared value which is used to determine if
*        the algorithm should terminate is the mean of the following
*        expression (the mean is taken over the entire input array,
*        the margins used to pad the input array are excluded):
*
*           ( D - S )**2 / ( CHIFAC*S - V )
*
*        where D is the observed data value, S is the simulated data
*        value based on the current version of the restored array, V is
*        the variance of the error associated with D, and CHIFAC is the
*        value of parameter CHIFAC.  Using 0 for CHIFAC results in the
*        standard expression for chi-squared.  However, the algorithm 
*        sometimes has difficulty fitting bright features and so may
*        not reach the required normalised chi-squared value.  Setting
*        CHIFAC to 1 (as is done by the LUCY program in the STSDAS
*        package within IRAF) causes larger data values to be given
*        less weight in the chi-squared calculation, and so encourages
*        lower chi-squared values. [1.0]
*     IN= NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF containing the observed data. 
*     NITER = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The maximum number of iterations to perform. [50]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The restored output array.  The background specified by
*        parameters BACK and BACKVAL will have been removed from this
*        array.  The output is the same size as the input.  There is no
*        VARIANCE component in the output, but any QUALITY values are
*        propagated from the input to the output.
*     PSF = NDF (Read)
*        An NDF holding an estimate of the Point-Spread Function (PSF)
*        of the input array.  This could, for instance, be produced
*        using the KAPPA application `PSF'. There should be no bad
*        pixels in the PSF otherwise an error will be reported.  The
*        PSF can be centred anywhere within the array, but the location
*        of the centre must be specified using parameters XCENTRE and
*        YCENTRE.  The PSF is assumed to have the value zero outside
*        the supplied NDF.
*     SIGMA = _REAL (Read)
*        The standard deviation of the noise in the observed data.
*        This is only used if parameter VARIANCE is given the value
*        FALSE.  The run-time default is an estimate of the noise
*        based on the difference between adjacent pixel values in the
*        observed data. []
*     START = NDF (Read)
*        An NDF containing an initial guess at the restored array.
*        This could, for instance, be the output from a previous run of
*        LUCY, in which case the deconvolution would continue from the
*        point it had previously reached.  If a null value is given,
*        then the restored array is initialised to a constant value
*        equal to the difference between the mean observed data value
*        and the mean background value. [!]
*     SNYDER = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then the variance of the observed data sample is added
*        to both the numerator and denominator when evaluating the
*        correction factor for each data sample.  This is the modified
*        form of the R-L algorithm used by the LUCY program in the
*        STSDAS package within IRAF. [TRUE]
*     THRESH = _REAL (Read)
*        The fraction of the PSF peak amplitude at which the extents of
*        the PSF are determined.  These extents are used to determine
*        the size of the margins used to pad the supplied input array.
*        Lower values of THRESH will result in larger margins being
*        used.  THRESH must be positive and less than 0.5.  [0.0625]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A title for the output NDF.  A null (!) value means using the
*        title of the input NDF. [!]
*     VARIANCE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then the variance of each input data sample will be
*        obtained from the VARIANCE component of the input NDF.  An
*        error is reported if this option is selected and the NDF has
*        no VARIANCE component.  If FALSE, then a constant variance
*        equal to the square of the value given for parameter SIGMA is
*        used for all data samples.  The run-time default is TRUE if the
*        input NDF has a VARIANCE component, and FALSE otherwise. []
*     WLIM = _REAL (Read)
*        If the input array contains bad pixels, then this parameter
*        may be used to determine the number of good data values which
*        must contribute to an output pixel before a valid value is
*        stored in the restored array.  It can be used, for example, to
*        prevent output pixels from being generated in regions where
*        there are relatively few good data values to contribute to the
*        restored result. It can also be used to `fill in' small areas
*        (i.e. smaller than the PSF) of bad pixels.
*
*        The numerical value given for WLIM specifies the minimum total
*        weight associated with the good pixels in a smoothing box
*        required to generate a good output pixel (weights for each
*        pixel are defined by the normalised PSF).  If this specified
*        minimum weight is not present, then a bad output pixel will
*        result, otherwise a smoothed output value will be calculated.
*        The value of this parameter should lie between 0.0 and
*        1.0.  WLIM=0 causes a good output value to be created even if
*        there is only one good input value, whereas WLIM=1 causes a
*        good output value to be created only if all input values are
*        good.  Values less than 0.5 will tend to reduce the number of
*        bad pixels, whereas values larger than 0.5 will tend to
*        increase the number of bad pixels.
*
*        This threshold is applied each time a smoothing operation is
*        performed.  Many smoothing operations are typically performed
*        in a run of LUCY, and if WLIM is larger than 0.5 the effects
*        of bad pixels will propagate further through the array at each
*        iteration.  After several iterations this could result in there
*        being no good data left.  An error is reported if this
*        happens. [0.001]
*     XCENTRE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The x pixel index of the centre of the PSF within the supplied
*        PSF array.  The run-time default is the middle pixel (rounded
*        down if there are an even number of pixels per line). []
*     YCENTRE = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The y pixel index of the centre of the PSF within the supplied
*        PSF array. The run-time default is the middle line (rounded
*        down if there are an even number of lines). []

*  Examples:
*     lucy m51 star m51_hires
*        This example deconvolves the array in the NDF called m51,
*        putting the resulting array in the NDF called m51_hires.  The
*        PSF is defined by the array in NDF star (the centre of the
*        PSF is assumed to be at the central pixel).  The deconvolution
*        terminates when a normalised chi-squared value of 1.0 is
*        reached.
*     lucy m51 star m51_hires 0.5 niter=60
*        This example performs the same function as the previous
*        example, except that the deconvolution terminates when a
*        normalised chi-squared value of 0.5 is reached, giving higher
*        apparent resolution at the expense of extra spurious
*        noise-based structure.  The maximum number of iterations is
*        increased to 60 to give the algorithm greater opportunity to
*        reach the reduced chi-squared value.
*     lucy m51 star m51_hires2 0.1 start=m51_hires 
*        This example continues the deconvolution started by the
*        previous example in order to achieve a normalised chi-squared
*        of 0.1.  The output array from the previous example is used to
*        initialise the restored array. 

*  Notes:
*     - The convolutions required by the R-L algorithm are performed by
*     the multiplication of Fourier transforms.  The supplied input
*     array is extended by a margin along each edge to avoid problems
*     of wrap-around between opposite edges of the array.  The width of
*     this margin is about equal to the width of the significant part
*     of the PSF (as determined by parameter THRESH).  The application
*     displays the width of these margins.  The margins are filled by
*     replicating the edge pixels from the supplied input NDFs.
*
*     - The R-L algorithm works best for arrays which have zero
*     background.  Non-zero backgrounds cause dark rings to appear
*     around bright, compact sources.  To avoid this a background array
*     should be created before running LUCY and assigned to the
*     parameter BACK.  The SEGMENT and SURFIT applications within KAPPA
*     can be used to create such a background array.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     VARIANCE, LABEL, TITLE, UNITS, WCS and HISTORY components of the
*     input NDF and propagates all extensions.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.  Arithmetic
*     is performed using single-precision floating point.
