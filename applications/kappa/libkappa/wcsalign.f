      SUBROUTINE WCSALIGN( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     WCSALIGN

*  Purpose:
*     Aligns a group of 2-dimensional NDFs using World Co-ordinate System 
*     information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL WCSALIGN( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application resamples a group of 2-dimensional input NDFs,
*     producing corresponding output NDFs which are aligned pixel-for-pixel
*     with a specified reference NDF. 
*
*     The transformations needed to produce alignment are derived from the 
*     co-ordinate system information stored in the WCS components of the
*     supplied NDFs. For each input NDF, alignment is first attempted in 
*     the current co-ordinate Frame of the reference NDF. If this fails,
*     alignment is attempted in the current co-ordinate Frame of the input
*     NDF. If this fails, alignment occurs in the pixel co-ordinate Frame.
*     A message indicating which Frame alignment was achieved in is
*     displayed.
*     
*     The output image values are formed by re-sampling the input image
*     values using nearest neighbour, bi-linear, sinc, sincsinc, sinccos,
*     or sincgauss interpolation (see parameter METHOD). 
*
*     Two methods exist for determining the bounds of the output images.
*     Firstly, the user can give values for parameters LBND and UBND
*     which are then used as the pixel index bounds for all output
*     images. Secondly, if a null value is given for LBND or UBND,
*     default values are generated separately for each output image so
*     that the output image just encloses the entire area covered by the
*     corresponding input image. Using the first method will ensure that
*     all output images have the same pixel origin, and so the resulting
*     images can be directly compared. However, this may result in the
*     output images being larger than necessary. In general, the second
*     method results in smaller images being produced, in less time.
*     However, the output images will have differing pixel origins which
*     need to be taken into account when comparing the aligned images.

*  Usage:
*     wcsalign in out lbnd ubnd ref 

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ACC = _REAL (Read)
*        The positional accuracy required, as a a number of pixels. For
*        highly non-linear projections, a recursive algorithm is used in
*        which successively smaller regions of the projection are fitted 
*        with a least squares linear transformation. If such a transformation 
*        results in a maximum positional error greater than the value 
*        supplied for ACC (in pixels), then a smaller region is used. High 
*        accuracy is paid for by larger run times. [0.5]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        A group of 2-dimensional input images. This should be given as 
*        a comma separated list, in which each list element can be:
*
*        - an NDF name, optionally containing wild-cards and/or regular 
*        expressions ("*", "?", "[a-z]" etc.). 
*
*        - the name of a text file, preceded by an up-arrow character "^".
*        Each line in the text file should contain a comma separated list
*        of elements, each of which can in turn be an NDF name (with
*        optional wild-cards, etc), or another file specification
*        (preceded by an up-arrow). Comments can be included in the file 
*        by commencing lines with a hash character "#".
*
*        If the value supplied for this parameter ends with a minus
*        sign "-", then the user is re-prompted for further input until
*        a value is given which does not end with a minus sign. All the
*        images given in this way are concatenated into a single group.
*     LBND( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        A pair of values giving the lower pixel index bound on each axis 
*        for the output images. The given values are used for all output 
*        images.  If a null value (!) is given for this parameter or for 
*        parameter UBND, then separate default values are calculated for 
*        each output image which result in the output image just encompassing 
*        the corresponding input image. The suggested defaults are the 
*        lower pixel index bounds from the reference image (see parameter REF).
*     MAXPIX = _INTEGER (Read)
*        A value which specifies an initial scale size in pixels for the
*        adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings with
*        piece-wise linear transformations. If MAXPIX is larger than any
*        dimension of the region of the output grid being used, a first
*        attempt will be made to approximate the Mapping by a linear
*        transformation over the entire output region. If a smaller value
*        is used, the output region will first be divided into subregions
*        whose size does not exceed MAXPIX pixels in any dimension, and then
*        attempts will be made at approximation. [1000]
*     METHOD = LITERAL (Read)
*        The method to use when sampling the input pixel values, in
*        order to find the corresponding output pixel value. For details 
*        on these sub-pixel interpolation schemes, see the description of 
*        routine AST_RESAMPLEx in SUN/210. METHOD can take the following 
*        values:
*
*        - "Bilinear" -- the output pixel values are calculated by 
*        bi-linear interpolation among the four nearest pixels values 
*        in the input image. Produces smoother output images than
*        the nearest neighbour scheme, but is marginally slower.
*
*        - "Nearest" -- the output pixel values are assigned the value 
*        of the single nearest input pixel.
*
*        - "Sinc" -- use the sinc(pi*x) kernel, where x is the pixel
*        offset from the interpolation point, and sinc(z)=sin(z)/z.
*        Use of this scheme is not recommended.
*
*        - "SincSinc" -- uses the sinc(pi*x)sinc(k*pi*x) kernel. A
*        valuable general-purpose interpolation scheme, intermediate
*        in its visual effect on images between the bilinear and
*        nearest neighbour schemes. 
*         
*        - "SincCos" -- uses the sinc(pi*x)cos(k*pi*x) kernal. Gives
*        similar results to the sincsinc scheme.
*
*        - "SincGauss" -- uses the sinc(pi*x)exp(-k*x*x). Good 
*        results can be obtained by matching the FWHM of the
*        envelope function to the point spread function of the
*        input data (see parameter PARAMS).
*
*        All methods propagate variances from input to output, but the
*        variance estimates produced by interpolation schemes other than
*        nearest neighbour need to be treated with care since the spatial 
*        smoothing produced by this interpolation methods introduces 
*        correlations in the variance estimates. Also, the degree of 
*        smoothing produced varies across the image. This is because a 
*        sample taken at a pixel centre will have no contributions from the 
*        neighbouring pixels, whereas a sample taken at the corner of a 
*        pixel will have equal contributions from all four neighbouring 
*        pixels, resulting in greater smoothing and lower noise. This 
*        effect can produce complex Moire patterns in the output 
*        variance estimates, resulting from the interference of the 
*        spatial frequencies in the sample positions and in the pixel 
*        centre positions. For these reasons, if you want to use the 
*        output variances, you are generally safer using nearest neighbour
*        interpolation. [current value]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        A group of output NDFs corresponding one-for-one with the list
*        of input NDFs given for parameter IN. This should be given as 
*        a comma separated list, in which each list element can be:
*        - an NDF name. If the name contains an asterisk character "*",
*        the name of the corresponding input image (without directory or
*        file suffix) is substituted for the asterisk (for instance, "*_al" 
*        causes the output image name to be formed by appending the string 
*        "_al" to the corresponding input image name). Input image names
*        can also be edited by including original and replacement strings 
*        between vertical bars after the NDF name (for instance,
*        *_al|b4|B1| causes any occurrence of the string "B4" in the input 
*        image name to be replaced by the string "B1" before appending the
*        string "_al" to the result).
*
*        - the name of a text file, preceded by an up-arrow character "^".
*        Each line in the text file should contain a comma separated list
*        of elements, each of which can in turn be an NDF name (with
*        optional editing, etc), or another file specification
*        (preceded by an up-arrow). Comments can be included in the file 
*        by commencing lines with a hash character "#".
*
*        If the value supplied for this parameter ends with a minus
*        sign "-", then the user is re-prompted for further input until
*        a value is given which does not end with a minus sign. All the
*        images given in this way are concatenated into a single group.
*     PARAMS( 2 ) = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        An optional array which consists of additional parameters
*        required by the Sinc, SincSinc, SincCos, and SincGauss
*        interpolation schemes. 
*
*        PARAMS( 1 ) is required by all the above interpolation schemes.
*        It is used to specify how many pixels are to contribute to the 
*        interpolated result on either side of the interpolation point 
*        in each dimension. Typically, a value of 2 is appropriate and the 
*        minimum allowed value is 1 ( i.e. one pixel on each side ). A value 
*        of zero or less indicates that a suitable number of pixels should be
*        calculated automatically. [0]
*
*        PARAMS( 2 ) is required only by the SincSinc, SincCos, and 
*        SincGauss interpolation schemes. For the SincSinc and SincCos 
*        schemes, it specifies the number of pixels at which the envelope
*        of the function goes to zero. The minimum value is 1.0, and the
*        run-time default value is 2.0. For the SincGauss scheme, it
*        specifies the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian 
*        envelope. The minimum value is 0.1, and the run-time default is
*        1.0. On astronomical images and spectra, good results are often 
*        obtained by approximately matching the FWHM of the envelope 
*        function, given by PARAMS(2), to the point spread function of the 
*        input data. []
*     REF = NDF (Read)
*        A 2-dimensional NDF containing the image to which all the input
*        images are to be aligned. If a null value is supplied for this 
*        parameter, the first image supplied for parameter IN is used. 
*     UBND( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        A pair of values giving the upper pixel index bound on each axis 
*        for the output images. The given values are used for all output 
*        images.  If a null value (!) is given for this parameter or for 
*        parameter UBND, then separate default values are calculated for 
*        each output image which result in the output image just encompassing 
*        the corresponding input image. The suggested defaults are the 
*        lower pixel index bounds from the reference image (see parameter REF).

*  Examples:
*     wcsalign image1 image1_al ref=image2 accept
*        This example resamples the 2-dimensional NDF called image1 so that
*        it is aligned with the 2-dimensional NDF call image2, putting the
*        output in image1_al. The output image has the same pixel index
*        bounds as image2 and inherits WCS information from image2.
*     wcsalign m51* *_al lbnd=! accept
*        This example resamples all the 2-dimensional NDFs with names 
*        starting with the string "m51" in the current directory so that 
*        they are aligned with the first input NDF. The output images
*        have the same names as the input images, but extended with the
*        string "_al". Each output image is just big enough to contain all 
*        the pixels in the corresponding input image.
*     wcsalign ^in.lis ^out.lis lbnd=! accept
*        This example is like the previous example, except that the names
*        of the input images are read from the text file in.lis, and the
*        names of the corresponding output images are read from text file
*        out.lis.

*  Notes:
*     -  WCS information (including the current co-ordinate Frame) is 
*     propagated from the reference NDF to all output NDFs. 
*     -  QUALITY is propagated from input to output only if parameter
*     METHOD is set to Nearest.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: WCSFRAME, TRANMAKE, TRANSFORMER; CCDPACK: TRANNDF

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the DATA, VARIANCE, LABEL, 
*     TITLE, UNITS, WCS and HISTORY components of the input NDFs (see the
*     METHOD parameter for notes on the interpretation of output variances).
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled.
