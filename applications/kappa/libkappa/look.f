      SUBROUTINE LOOK( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     LOOK

*  Purpose:
*     Lists pixel values in a one- or two-dimensional NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LOOK( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application lists pixel values within a region of a
*     two-dimensional NDF.  The listing may be displayed on the screen
*     and logged in a text file (see Parameter LOGFILE).  The region
*     to be listed can be specified either by giving its centre and
*     size or its corners, or by giving an `ARD Description' for the
*     region (see Parameter MODE). The top-right pixel value is also
*     written to an output Parameter (VALUE).  The listing may be
*     produced in several different formats (see Parameter FORMAT), and
*     the format of each individual displayed data value can be
*     controlled using Parameter STYLE.

*  Usage:
*     look ndf centre [size] [logfile] [format] [comp] [mode]
*        { arddesc=?
*        { ardfile=?
*        { lbound=? ubound=?
*        { centre=?
*        mode

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AGAIN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the user is prompted for further regions to list until
*        a FALSE value is obtained.  [FALSE]
*     ARDDESC = LITERAL (Read)
*        An `ARD Description' for the parts of the image to be listed.
*        Multiple lines can be supplied by ending each line with a
*        hyphen, in which case further prompts for ARDDESC are made
*        until a value is supplied which does not end with a hyphen.
*        All the supplied values are then concatenated together (after
*        removal of the trailing minus signs).  ARDDESC is only accessed
*        if MODE is "ARD". Positions in the ARD description are assumed
*        to be in the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF unless there
*        are COFRAME or WCS statements which indicate a different
*        system.  See "Notes" below.
*     ARDFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        The name of an existing text file containing an `ARD
*        Description' for the parts of the image to be listed.  ARDFILE
*        is only accessed if MODE is "ARDFile". Positions in the ARD
*        description are assumed to be in pixel co-ordinates unless
*        there are COFRAME or WCS statements that indicate a different
*        system.  See "Notes" below.
*     CENTRE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The co-ordinates of the data pixel at the centre of the area to
*        be displayed, in the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF
*        (supplying a colon ":" will display details of the current
*        co-ordinate Frame).  The position should be supplied as a list
*        of formatted axis values separated by spaces or commas.  See
*        also Parameter USEAXIS. CENTRE is only acessed if MODE is
*        "Centre".
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The NDF array component to be displayed.  It may be "Data",
*        "Quality", "Variance", or "Error" (where "Error" is an
*        alternative to "Variance" and causes the square root of the
*        variance values to be displayed).  If "Quality" is specified,
*        then the quality values are treated as numerical values (in
*        the range 0 to 255).  ["Data"]
*     FORMAT = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the format for the listing from the following
*        options.
*
*        - "strips" -- The area being displayed is divided up into
*        vertical strips of limited width. Each strip is displayed in
*        turn, with Y pixel index at the left of each row, and
*        X pixel index at the top of each column. The highest row is
*        listed first in each strip. This format is intended for human
*        readers - the others are primarily intended for being read by
*        other software.
*
*        - "clist" -- Each row of textual output consists of an X pixel
*        index, followed by a Y pixel index, followed by the pixel data
*        value. No headers or blank lines are included. The pixels are
*        listed in "Fortran order"---the lower left pixel first, and the
*        upper right pixel last.
*
*        - "cglist" -- Like "clist" except bad pixels are omitted from
*        the list.
*
*        - "wlist" -- Each row of textual output consists of the WCS
*        co-ordinates of the pixel, followed by the pixel data value. No
*        headers or blank lines are included.  The pixels are listed in
*        "Fortran order"---the lower left pixel first, and the upper
*        right pixel last.
*
*        - "wglist" -- Like "wlist" except bad pixels are omitted from
*        the list.
*
*        - "vlist" -- Each row of textual output consists of just the
*        pixel data value. No headers or blank lines are included. The
*        pixels are listed in "Fortran order"---the lower-left pixel
*        first, and the upper-right pixel last.
*
*        - "region" -- The pixel data values are listed as a
*        two-dimensional region.  Each row of textual output contains a
*        whole row of data values.  The textual output may be truncated
*        if it is too wide.  The lowest row is listed first.
*
*        In all cases, adjacent values are separated by spaces, and bad
*        pixel values are represented by the string "BAD".  ["strips"]
*     LBOUND = LITERAL (Read)
*        The co-ordinates of the data pixel at the bottom-left of the
*        area to be displayed, in the current co-ordinate Frame of the
*        NDF (supplying a colon ":" will display details of the current
*        co-ordinate Frame).  The position should be supplied as a list
*        of  formatted axis values separated by spaces or commas. See
*        also Parameter USEAXIS.  A null (!) value causes the
*        bottom-left corner of the supplied NDF to be used.  LBOUND is
*        only accessed if MODE is "Bounds".
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Write)
*        The name of the text file in which the textual output may be
*        stored. See MAXLEN. A null string (!) means that no file is
*        created.  [!]
*     MAXLEN = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The maximum number of characters in a line of textual output.
*        The line is truncated after the last complete value if it would
*        extend beyond this value.  [80]
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Indicates how the region to be listed will be specified:
*
*        - "All" -- The entire NDF is used.
*
*        - "Centre" -- The centre and size of the region are specified
*        using parameters CENTRE and SIZE.
*
*        - "Bounds" -- The bounds of the region are specified using
*        parameters LBOUND and UBOUND.
*
*        - "ARDFile" -- The region is given by an `ARD Description'
*        supplied within a text file specified using Parameter ARDFILE.
*        Pixels outside the ARD region are represented by the string
*        "OUT".
*
*        - "ARD" -- The region is given using an ARD description
*        supplied directly using Parameter ARDDESC. Pixels outside the
*        ARD region are represented by the string "OUT".
*
*        ["Centre"]
*     NDF = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF structure containing the data to be displayed.
*     SIZE( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The dimensions of the rectangular area to be displayed, in
*        pixels. If a single value is given, it is used for both axes.
*        The area is centred on the position specified by parameter
*        CENTRE.   It is only accessed if MODE is "Centre". [7]
*     STYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the format to use
*        for individual data values.
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be
*        read and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings
*        are applied in the order in which they occur within the list,
*        with later settings over-riding any earlier settings given for
*        the same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a Frame attribute, and <value> is
*        the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will be
*        used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied.  See Section
*        "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description of the
*        available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are ignored
*        (no error is reported).
*
*        Data values are formatted using attributes Format(1) and
*        Digits(1).  [current value]
*     UBOUND = LITERAL (Read)
*        The co-ordinates of the data pixel at the top-right corner of
*        the  area to be displayed, in the current co-ordinate Frame of
*        the NDF (supplying a colon ":" will display details of the
*        current co-ordinate Frame).  The position should be supplied as
*        a list of formatted axis values separated by spaces or commas.
*        See also Parameter USEAXIS.  A null (!) value causes the
*        top-right corner of the supplied NDF to be used.  UBOUND is
*        only accessed if MODE is "Bounds".
*     USEAXIS = GROUP (Read)
*        USEAXIS is only accessed if the current co-ordinate Frame of
*        the NDF has more than two axes.  A group of two strings should
*        be supplied specifying the two axes which are to be used when
*        supplying positions for parameters CENTRE, LBOUND and UBOUND.
*        Each axis can be specified using one of the following options.
*
*        - Its integer index within the current Frame of the input
*        NDF (in the range 1 to the number of axes in the current
*        Frame).
*        - Its symbol string such as "RA" or "VRAD".
*        - A generic option where "SPEC" requests the spectral axis,
*        "TIME" selects the time axis, "SKYLON" and "SKYLAT" picks the
*        sky longitude and latitude axes respectively.  Only those axis
*        domains present are available as options.
*
*        A list of acceptable values is displayed if you supply an
*        illegal value. If a null (!) value is supplied, the axes with
*        the same indices as the two used pixel axes within the NDF are
*        selected.  [!]
*     VALUE = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        An output parameter to which is written the data value at the
*        top-right pixel in the displayed rectangle.

*  Examples:
*     look ngc6872 "1:27:23 -22:41:12" logfile=log
*        Lists a 7x7 block of pixel values centred on RA/DEC 1:27:23,
*        -22:41:12 (this assumes that the current co-ordinate Frame in
*        the NDF is an RA/DEC Frame). The listing is written to the
*        text file "log".
*     look m57 mode=bo lbound="18 20" ubound="203 241"
*        Lists the pixel values in an NDF called m57, within a
*        rectangular region from pixel (18,20) to (203,241) (this
*        assumes that the current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF is pixel
*        co-ordinates). The listing is displayed on the screen only.
*     look ngc6872 "10 11" 1
*        Stores the value of pixel (10,11) in output parameter VALUE,
*        but does not store it in a log file. This assumes that the
*        current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF is pixel co-ordinates.
*     look ngc6872 mode=ard arddesc="circle(1:27:23,-22:41:12,0:0:10)"
*        Lists the pixel values within a circle of radius 10 arcseconds,
*        centred on RA=1:27:23 DEC=-22:41:12. This assumes that the
*        current co-ordinate Frame in the NDF is an RA/DEC Frame.
*     look ngc6872 mode=ardfile ardfile=central.ard
*        Lists the pixel values specified by the ARD description stored
*        in the text file "central.dat".

*  Notes:
*     - ARD files may be created by ARDGEN or written manually.  In the
*     latter case consult SUN/183 for full details of the ARD
*     descriptors and syntax; however, much may be learnt from looking
*     at the ARD files created by ARDGEN and the ARDGEN documentation.
*     There is also a summary with examples in the main body of SUN/95.
*     - The co-ordinate system in which positions are given within ARD
*     descriptions can be indicated by including suitable
*     COFRAME or WCS statements within the description (see SUN/183).
*     For instance, starting the description with the text
*     "COFRAME(PIXEL)" will indicate that positions are specified in
*     pixel co-ordinates. The statement "COFRAME(SKY,System=FK5)" would
*     indicate that positions are specified in RA/DEC (FK5,J2000). If
*     no such statements are included, then a default co-ordinate system
*     is used as specified in the parameter description above.
*     -  Output messages are not displayed on the screen when the
*     message filter environment variable MSG_FILTER is set to QUIET.
*     The creation of output parameters and the log file is unaffected
*     by MSG_FILTER.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: TRANDAT, ARDGEN, ARDMASK, ARDPLOT.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the DATA, QUALITY and
*     VARIANCE components of the input NDF.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
