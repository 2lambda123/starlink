      SUBROUTINE PLUCK ( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PLUCK

*  Purpose:
*     Plucks slices from an NDF at arbitrary positions.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PLUCK( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application's function is to extract data at scientifically 
*     relevant points such as the spatial location of a source or 
*     wavelength of a spectral feature, rather than at data sampling 
*     points (for which NDFCOPY is appropriate).  This is achieved by
*     the extraction of interpolated slices from an NDF.  A slice is
*     located at a supplied set of co-ordinates in the current WCS
*     Frame for some but not all axes, and it possesses one fewer 
*     significant dimension per supplied co-ordinate.  The slices run
*     parallel to pixel axes of the NDF.

*     The interpolation uses one of a selection of resampling methods 
*     to effect the non-integer shifts along the fixed axes, applied to
*     each output element along the retained axes (see the METHOD, 
*     PARAMS, and TOL parameters).
*
*     Three routes are available for obtaining the fixed positions, 
*     selected using parameter MODE:
*
*     - from the parameter system (see parameter POS);
*
*     - from a specified positions list (see parameter INCAT); or
*
*     - from a simple text file containing a list of co-ordinates (see
*     parameter COIN).
*
*     In the first mode the application loops, asking for new extraction
*     co-ordinates until it is told to quit or encounters an error.
*     However there is no looping if the position has been supplied on 
*     the command line.
*
*     Each extracted dataset is written to a new NDF, which however, may
*     reside in a single container file (see the CONTAINER parameter).

*  Usage:
*     pluck in axes out method [mode] { pos
*                                     { coin=?
*                                     { incat=?
*                                    mode

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AXES( ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The WCS axis or axes to remain in the output NDF.   The slice
*        will therefore contain an array comprising all the elements
*        along these axes.  The maximum number of axes is one fewer 
*        than the number of WCS axes in the NDF.
*
*        Each axis can be specified using one of the following options.
*
*        - Its integer index within the current Frame of the input 
*        NDF (in the range 1 to the number of axes in the current 
*        Frame).
*        - Its symbol string such as "RA" or "VRAD".
*        - A generic option where "SPEC" requests the spectral axis, 
*        "TIME" selects the time axis, "SKYLON" and "SKYLAT" picks the 
*        sky longitude and latitude axes respectively.  Only those axis
*        domains present are available as options.
*
*        A list of acceptable values is displayed if an illegal value is
*        supplied.  If the axes of the current Frame are not parallel to
*        the NDF pixel axes, then the pixel axis which is most nearly 
*        parallel to the specified current Frame axis will be used.
*     COIN = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of a text file containing the co-ordinates of slices to 
*        be plucked.  It is only accessed if parameter MODE is given the
*        value "File".  Each line should contain the formatted axis 
*        values for a single position, in the current Frame of the NDF. 
*        Axis values can be separated by spaces, tabs or commas.  The 
*        file may contain comment lines with the first character # or !.
*     CONTAINER = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, each slice extracted is written as an NDF component of
*        the HDS container file specified by the OUT parameter.  The nth
*        component will be named PLUCK_n.  If set FALSE, each extraction
*        is written to a separate file.  On-the-fly format conversion to
*        foreign formats is not possible when CONTAINER=TRUE. [FALSE]
*     DESCRIBE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, a detailed description of the co-ordinate Frame in 
*        which the fixed co-ordinates are to be supplied is displayed 
*        before the positions themselves.  It is ignored if
*        MODE="Catalogue".  [current value]
*     INCAT = FILENAME (Read)
*        A catalogue containing a positions list giving the co-ordinates
*        of the fixed positions, such as produced by applications 
*        CURSOR, LISTMAKE, etc.  It is only accessed if parameter MODE
*        is given the value "Catalogue".  The catalogue should have a 
*        WCS Frame common with the NDF, so that the NDF and catalogue 
*        FrameSets can be aligned.
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The mode in which the initial co-ordinates are to be obtained.
*        The supplied string can be one of the following values.
*
*        - "Interface" -- positions are obtained using parameter POS.
*
*        - "Catalogue" -- positions are obtained from a positions list
*                         using parameter INCAT.
*
*        - "File"      -- positions are obtained from a text file using 
*                         parameter COIN.
*
*        [current value]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF structure containing the data to be extracted.  It
*        must have at least two dimensions.
*     METHOD = LITERAL (Read)
*        The method to use when sampling the input pixel values.  For
*        details of these schemes, see the descriptions of routine 
*        AST_RESAMPLEx in SUN/210. METHOD can take the following values.
*
*        - "Linear" -- When resampling, the output pixel values are 
*        calculated by linear interpolation in the input NDF among the
*        two nearest pixel values along each axis chosen by AXES.  This 
*        method produces smoother output NDFs than the
*        nearest-neighbour scheme, but is marginally slower.
*
*        - "Sinc" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x) kernel, where x is the pixel
*        offset from the interpolation point, and sinc(z)=sin(z)/z.  Use
*        of this scheme is not recommended.
*
*        - "SincSinc" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x)sinc(k*pi*x) kernel. A
*        valuable general-purpose scheme, intermediate in its visual
*        effect on NDFs between the linear option and using the
*        nearest neighbour.
*
*        - "SincCos" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x)cos(k*pi*x) kernel.  Gives
*        similar results to the "SincSinc" scheme.
*
*        - "SincGauss" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x)exp(-k*x*x) kernel.  Good 
*        results can be obtained by matching the FWHM of the
*        envelope function to the point-spread function of the
*        input data (see parameter PARAMS).
*
*        - "Somb" -- Uses the somb(pi*x) kernel, where x is the pixel
*        offset from the interpolation point, and somb(z)=2*J1(z)/z (J1
*        is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind.  This 
*        scheme is similar to the "Sinc" scheme.
*
*        - "SombCos" -- Uses the somb(pi*x)cos(k*pi*x) kernel.  This
*        scheme is similar to the "SincCos" scheme.
*
*        - "BlockAve"  -- Block averaging over all pixels in the 
*        surrounding N-dimensional cube.
*
*        All methods propagate variances from input to output, but the
*        variance estimates produced by interpolation schemes need to be
*        treated with care since the spatial smoothing produced by these
*        methods introduces correlations in the variance estimates.  The
*        initial default is "SincSinc".  [current value]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The name for the output NDF, or the name of the single 
*        container file if CONTAINER=TRUE.
*     PARAMS( 2 ) = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        An optional array which consists of additional parameters
*        required by the Sinc, SincSinc, SincCos, SincGauss, Somb,
*        SombCos, and Gauss methods.
*
*        PARAMS(1) is required by all the above schemes.  It is used to
*        specify how many pixels are to contribute to the interpolated 
*        result on either side of the interpolation in each dimension.  
*        Typically, a value of 2 is appropriate and the minimum allowed 
*        value is 1 (i.e. one pixel on each side).  A value of zero or 
*        fewer indicates that a suitable number of pixels should be 
*        calculated automatically.  [0]
*
*        PARAMS(2) is required only by the SombCos, Gauss, SincSinc, 
*        SincCos, and SincGauss schemes.  For the SombCos, SincSinc, and
*        SincCos schemes, it specifies the number of pixels at which the
*        envelope of the function goes to zero.  The minimum value is
*        1.0, and the run-time default value is 2.0.  For the Gauss and
*        SincGauss scheme, it specifies the full-width at half-maximum
*        (FWHM) of the Gaussian envelope.  The minimum value is 0.1, and
*        the run-time default is 1.0.  On astronomical images and 
*        spectra, good results are often obtained by approximately 
*        matching the FWHM of the envelope function, given by PARAMS(2),
*        to the point-spread function of the input data.  []
*     POS( ) = LITERAL (Read)
*        An the co-ordinates of the next slice to be extracted, in the
*        current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF (supplying a colon ":" 
*        will display details of the current co-ordinate Frame).  The 
*        position should be supplied as a list of formatted axis values 
*        separated by spaces or commas.  POS is only accessed if 
*        parameter MODE is given the value "Interface".  If the 
*        co-ordinates are supplied on the command line only one
*        slice will be extracted; otherwise the application will ask 
*        for further positions which may be terminated by supplying the 
*        null value (!).
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A Title for every output NDF structure.  A null value (!)
*        propagates the title from the input NDF to all output NDFs.
*        [!]
*     TOL = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may be
*        introduced as a result of approximating non-linear Mappings 
*        by a set of piece-wise linear transforms.  Both
*        algorithms approximate non-linear co-ordinate transformations
*        in order to improve performance, and this parameter controls
*        how inaccurate the resulting approximation is allowed to be,
*        as a displacement in pixels of the input NDF.  A value of 
*        zero will ensure that no such approximation is done, at the 
*        expense of increasing execution time. [0.05]

*  Examples:
*     pluck omc1 pos="5:35:13.7,-5:22:13.6" axes=FREQ
*           method=sincgauss params=[3,5] out=omc1_trap
*        The NDF omc1 is a spectral-imaging cube with
*        (Right ascension, declination, frequency) World Co-ordinate 
*        axes.  This example extracts a spectrum at RA=5h35m13.7s, 
*        Dec=-5d22m13.6 using the SincGauss interpolation method.
*        Three pixels either side of the point are used to interpolate,
*        the full-width half-maximum of the Gaussian is five pixels.
*        The resultant spectrum called omc1_trap, is still a cube, but
*        its spatial dimensions each only have one element.
*     pluck omc1 mode=cat incat=a axes=FREQ container out=omc1_spectra
*        This example reads the fixed positions from the
*        positions list in file a.FIT.  The selected spectra are stored
*        in an HDS container file called omc1_spectra.sdf.
*     pluck omc1 mode=cat incat=a axes=SPEC container out=omc1_spectra
*        As the previous example, plucking spectra, this time by
*        selecting the generic spectral axis.
*     pluck omc1 pos=3.45732E11 axes="RA,Dec" method=lin out=peakplane
*        This example extracts a plane from omc1 at frequency 
*        3.45732E11 Hz using linear interpolation and stores it in NDF
*        peakplane.

*  Notes:
*     -  In Interface or File modes all positions should be supplied in 
*     the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF.  A description of the 
*     co-ordinate Frame being used is given if parameter DESCRIBE is set
*     to a TRUE value.  Application WCSFRAME can be used to change the 
*     current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF before running this 
*     application if required.
*     -  The output NDF has the same dimensionality as the input NDF,
*     although the axes with fixed co-ordinates (those not specified 
*     by the AXES parameter) are degenerate, having bounds of 1:1. 
*     The retention of these insignificant axes enables the 
*     co-ordinates of where the slice originated to be recorded. 
*     Such fixed co-ordinates may be examined with say NDFTRACE.  
*     NDFCOPY may be used to trim the degenerate axes if their presence
*     prevents some old non-KAPPA tasks from operating.
*     -  In Catalogue or File modes the table file need only contain
*     columns supplying the fixed positions.  In this case the 
*     co-ordinates along the retained axes are deemed to be independent,
*     that is they do not affect the shifts required of the other axes.
*     In practice this assumption only affects File mode, as catalogues
*     made with CURSOR or LISTMAKE will contain WCS information.
*     
*     In Interface mode representaive co-ordinates along retained axes
*     are the midpoints of the bounds of an array that would contain the
*     resampled copy of the whole input array.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: NDFCOPY, REGRID.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  The LABEL, UNITS, and HISTORY components, and all extensions
*     are propagated.  TITLE is controlled by the TITLE parameter. 
*     DATA, VARIANCE, AXIS, and WCS are propagated after appropriate 
*     modification.  The QUALITY component is not propagated.
*     -  The processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled. 
*     -  The minimum number of dimensions in the input NDF is two.
*     -  Processing a group of input NDFs is not supported unless
*     CONTAINER = TRUE or when only one output NDF is created per
*     input file.
