*  Name:
*     KPS1_GLIBR

*  Purpose:
*     Get pixel positions to be de-glitched from the environment.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_GLIBR( LBND1, LBND2, UBND1, UBND2, DIN, IPPIX, NPOS, STATUS ) 

*  Description:
*     This routine returns an array holding the pixel co-ordinates at the
*     centre of all the bad pixels in the supplied array.

*  Arguments:
*     LBND1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Lower pixel index on axis 1.
*     LBND2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Lower pixel index on axis 2.
*     UBND1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Upper pixel index on axis 1.
*     UBND2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Upper pixel index on axis 2.
*     DIN( LBND1:UBND1, LBND2:UBND2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input data array.
*     IPPIX = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to a double precision array with dimensions (NPOS,2),
*        containing the pixel co-ordinates at the centre of every bad pixel.
*        This should be freed with PSX_FREE when no longer needed.
*     NPOS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of returned positions. Returned equal to zero if
*        there are no bad pixels in the array,
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The inherited status.
