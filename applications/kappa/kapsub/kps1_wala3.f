      SUBROUTINE KPS1_WALA3( MAP, LBNDX, UBNDX, LBNDY, UBNDY, ERRLIM, 
     :                       XAMAP, YAMAP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_WALA3

*  Purpose:
*     Find the input pixel coordinates corresponding to the centre of
*     each output pixel created by WCSALIGN.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_WALA3( MAP, LBNDX, UBNDX, LBNDY, UBNDY, ERRLIM,
*                      XAMAP, YAMAP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     In principle, one could fill the XAMAP and YAMAP arrays by simply
*     transforming every point using the supplied Mapping. However,
*     this would take a very long time to do for anything other than a
*     very small image. Much CPU time can be saved by approximating the
*     full projection mappings by six coefficient linear mappings. For
*     most uses, the mapping over the entire image will be describable
*     by a single linear transformation, but for large ones this may not
*     be the case. This routine adopts a recursive approach in which
*     checks are made on succesively smaller regions until a region is
*     found which can be described by a linear transformation.
*
*     This process is implemented in terms of an imaginary recursive
*     subroutine FILL. Fortran does not support recursive subroutines
*     (i.e.  subroutines which can call themselves). Therefore a
*     recursive subroutine calling mechanism must be simulated using
*     local arrays to store the local variables for each entry to FILL.
*
*     The specification for FILL is:
*
*     SUBROUTINE FILL( MAP, LBNDX, UBNDX, LBNDY, UBNDY, IB1, IB2, JB1, 
*                      JB2, XAMAP, YAMAP, STATUS )
*
*     where MAP, LBNDX, UBNDX, LBNDY, UBNDY, XAMAP and YAMAP have just the 
*     same meaning as for the "real" subroutine KPS1_WALA3. The additional 
*     arguments IB1, IB2, JB1, JB2 define the section of the output arrays 
*     XAMAP and YAMAP which are to be filled.
*
*     FILL first transforms a grid of 9 points spread evenly over the
*     section (IB1:IB2, JB1:JB2) of the output image, producing
*     corresponding input pixel coordinates. The supplied Mapping is used 
*     for this purpose. A linear transformation is then calculated between 
*     the 9 corresponding positions using a least squares criterion. If the 
*     maximum error introduced by this fit at the 9 test points is acceptably 
*     small, then the fit is used to fill the specified section of the output 
*     arrays, and the subroutine FILL returns. If the linear fit is not 
*     acceptable then the specified section is divide into 4 quarters, and 
*     FILL is called to fill each quarter in turn.

*  Arguments:
*     MAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        AST Mapping from input pixel co-ordinates to reference (i.e.
*        output) pixel co-ordinates.
*     LBNDX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower X bound of the output image.
*     UBNDX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper X bound of the output image.
*     LBNDY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower Y bound of the output image.
*     UBNDY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper Y bound of the output image.
*     ERRLIM = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The position accuracy required when re-sampling the input NDF.
*        Given as a number of pixels.
*     XAMAP( LBNDX:UBNDX, LBNDY:UBNDY ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Holds the input X pixel coordinate corresponding to the centre
*        of each output pixel.
*     YAMAP( LBNDX:UBNDX, LBNDY:UBNDY ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Holds the input Y pixel coordinate corresponding to the centre
*        of each output pixel.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Variables containing "A" in their names are used to store
*     information relating to the input NDF. Variables containing "B"
*     in their names are used to store information relating to the
*     output NDF.
