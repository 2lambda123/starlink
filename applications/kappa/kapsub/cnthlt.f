      SUBROUTINE CNTHLT( NCONT, CNTLEV, CNTUSD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CNTHLT

*  Purpose:
*     List the contour heights that have been used.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CNTHLT( NCONT, CNTLEV, CNTUSD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine takes a list of contour heights and flags that
*     indicate whether a given height has been used (or is required),
*     and reports the values to the user via the message system.

*  Arguments:
*     NCONT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of contour heights.
*     CNTLEV( NCONT ) = REAL (Given)
*        The contour heights.
*     CNTUSD( NCONT ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true a contour height is to be reported.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The messages use ADAM parameters HEIGHT_LIST and HEIGHT_TITLE.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Find the first and last heights used, watching out for special
*        cases like only one height supplied.
*     -  For each used height append the (converted) height to a buffer,
*        append commas between values unless it is the last height.
*     -  Continue to append heights until more than 60 characters have
*        been used, then report the line of heights, and start a new
*        line in the buffer.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The contour levels and the flags should be sorted into order.
