      SUBROUTINE KPS1_LUTWK( NINTS, INLUT, ORIGIN, SQUSTR, WHITE,
     :                       OUTLUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_LUTWK

*  Purpose:
*     Routine to adjust image-display lookup table.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_LUTWK( NINTS, INLUT, ORIGIN, SQUSTR, WHITE, OUTLUT,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine adjusts the image-display lookup table.  The origin
*     may be displaced and/or the lookup table may be stretched or
*     squashed.  If the squash/stretch factor is negative the lookup
*     table will be flipped as well.  When the output lookup table is
*     squashed the remaining colour indices are filled with either
*     white or the first and last colours of the input lookup table,
*     the sense depending on the sign of the squash/stretch factor.
*     Should the lookup table begin to the left of the lookup table
*     then the section that 'overhangs' is just ignored. Equally if the
*     lookup table 'overhangs' at the right-hand end the extra is just
*     ignored.  In the squash/stretch operation the colour indices in
*     the part of the output lookup table that are been modified
*     are allocated the nearest value from the input lookup table.

*  Arguments:
*     NINTS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of colour indices available in the lookup table
*        excluding the reserved pens.
*     INLUT( 3, 0:NINTS-1 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The lookup table before alteration.
*     ORIGIN = REAL (Given)
*        The origin of the colour table, as taken from some measure of
*        the locator's x displacement.
*     SQUSTR = REAL (Given)
*        The compression of the colour table as obtained from the
*        locator's y displacement.  It acts as a pointer to a lookup
*        table of compression factors, where index zero corresponds to
*        unit magnification.  The value is constrained to lie
*        between -486 and 238.  These yield scaling from 0.012 to 32.0,
*        both positive and negative.  The scale factor increments for
*        unit displacement increase as the absolute scale factor
*        increases.
*     WHITE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true when the lookup table is squashed the remainder of the
*        output lookup table is padded in white, otherwise the first
*        and last colours in the input lookup table are used.
*     OUTLUT( 3, 0:NINTS-1 ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Resulting lookup table.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned )
*        Global status parameter.

*  Algorithm:
*     When fitting the lookup table to the pens the compression
*     is carried out using the equaton :
*     PEN = OFFSET + [ RANGE * COLOUR NUMBER / ( NO. OF PENS - 1 ) ]
