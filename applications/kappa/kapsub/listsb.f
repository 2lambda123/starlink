*+
*  Name:
*     LISTSB

*  Purpose:
*     Lists a specified section of a 2-d array to a file for
*     printing

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL LISTSB( ARRAY, DIM1, DIM2, XLOW, YLOW, XUPP, YUPP, OPENF,
*     :             FDI, FILNAM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine takes an input 2-d array and lists out a specified
*     section of that image, as defined by the x-and-y lower-and-upper
*     bounds to a Fortran file. The file must either be already opened
*     and specified by the input file descriptor, or be created in this
*     routine and will be associated with the supplied parameter name.
*     In the former case the width of a record must be at least 132
*     characters.  The format chosen gives ten numbers across a full
*     printout page (132 chars), and a new page is thrown at the right
*     point.

*  Arguments:
*     ARRAY( DIM1, DIM2 )  =  REAL( READ )
*         2-d array to be listed.
*     DIM1 = INTEGER( READ )
*         The first dimension of the 2-d array.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER( READ )
*         The second dimension of the 2-d array.
*     XLOW  =  INTEGER( READ )
*         x co-ord of lower left corner of sub-array to be listed out.
*     YLOW  =  INTEGER( READ )
*         y co-ord of lower left corner of sub-array to be listed out.
*     XUPP  =  INTEGER( READ )
*         x co-ord of upper right corner of sub-array to be listed out.
*     YUPP  =  INTEGER( READ )
*         y co-ord of upper right corner of sub-array to be listed out.
*     OPENF =  LOGICAL( READ )
*         If true the Fortran file is to be associated with %FILNAM and
*           opened otherwise the file is assumed to have been opened and
*           has descriptor %FD.
*     FDI  =  INTEGER( READ )
*         The descriptor associated with the previously opened Fortran
*           file.
*     FILNAM  =  CHAR( READ )
*         Parameter name of the file to be opened and to contain the
*           listing output.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER( READ, WRITE )
*         Global status value

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     Open file for listing if required
*     If an error occurred then abort
*     Loop round selected columns in strips of ten
*        Output new page and current strip number to file
*        If no error then
*           Work out the x indices of strip start and end
*           For all columns in current strip
*              Convert column index into a string
*              Stick this string into the output string
*           Endfor
*           If no error then
*              Output column index string to file
*              For all selected lines in current strip and no error
*                 Convert line index into string and put into output
*                   string
*                 For all selected pixels in current line
*                    If pixel does not lie on array
*                       Indicate with special string
*                    Elseif pixel is invalid
*                       Indicate with special string
*                    Else
*                       Get value from array at this pixel location
*                       Convert value to a string
*                       Stick the string into the output string at
*                         the right point
*                    Endif
*                 Endfor
*                 Output string corresponding to current line to file
*                 If an error occurred report it
*              Endfor
*              Increment loop counter
*           Endfor
*        Endif
*     Endfor
*     Close file if opened in the routine

*  History:
*     14-JUN-1986 (REVA::MJM):
*        : First implementation - partly from KFH
*     1986 Aug 14: Renamed from LISTSUB, completed prologue, removed
*                  format statements and added IOSTAT to file open,
*                  nearly conformed to Starlink programming standards
*                  (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1986 Sep 4 : Renamed parameters section to arguments, tidied
*                  and applied bad-pixel handling (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1988 Feb 15: Bug fix --- JJ assignment (RL.STAR::CUR)
*     1988 Jun 27: Converted to FIO, added error reporting, made FILNAM
*                  the parameter name rather than the file name itself,
*                  and restructured (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1989 Jul 27: Used packaged FIO_ASSOC to open the x,y file, and
*                  passed the array dimensions as two variables
*                  (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1990 Feb 20: AIF_OPFIO renamed AIF_ASFIO (RAL::CUR).
*     1990 Feb 22: Added new OPEN and FDI arguments so that listings
*                  can be inserted in the middle of other output in a
*                  Fortran file, i.e. to make it more modular
*                  (RAL::CUR).
*     1992 Jan 26: Used functional FIO_ASSOC and FIO_CANCL. (RAL::MJC)
