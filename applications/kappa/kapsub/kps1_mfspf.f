*  Name:
*     KPS1_MFSPF

*  Purpose:
*     Fits a cubic B-spline curve by least squares.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MFSPF( INTERP, MXKNOT, NKNOT, FKNOT, CMIN, CMAX, SCALE,
*                      NWS, EL, MAXVAL, X, Z, W, PERM, KNOT, COEFF,
*                      NCOEF, FACTOR, WS, IWS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine fits a cubic B-spline curve for the given vectors of
*     values and weights at the specified co-ordinates, and returns the
*     coefficients of the fit.  There is a choice of interpolating or
*     smmothing spline (see INTERP).  The interpolation fit passes
*     through the supplied knots.  The smoothing spline fit is more
*     complex, but it generates knots automatically when the weighted
*     sum of squares of the residuals exceeds a smoothing factor.
*     See the Notes for more details.

*  Arguments:
*     INTERP = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If set to true an interpolating least-squares spline is found
*        and the NKNOT interior knots are equally spaced.  Otherwise a
*        smoothing spline is fit using a smoothing factor equal to the
*        number of data points; and the spline fit sets the knots.
*     MXKNOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of knots including exterior knots.  This
*        is for the case when INTERP is false where the fitting routine
*        can only assign up to MXKNOT knots automatically.  When
*        INTERP is true, this should be set to NKNOT+8.  For INTERP
*        set false, the maximum numvber of knots should be at least
*        the lesser of EL / 2 or 200, although only up to 28 will
*        actually be used in the final fit, the others are needed for
*        iteration to a reasonable smoothing factor than minimises the
*        residuals whilst not fitting to small-scale features and noise.
*     NKNOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of interior knots.
*     FKNOT( NKNOT ) = REAL (Given)
*        Grid co-ordinates of the user-defined knot positions to be
*        applied to every trend when using an interpolating spline
*        (INTERP is true).  If the first element is negative, then
*        equally spaced knots are used.
*     CMIN = REAL (Given)
*        Minimum co-ordinate of the data bins (left edge, not the
*        centroid).
*     CMAX = REAL (Given)
*        Maximum co-ordinate of the data bins (right edge, not the
*        centroid).
*     SCALE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true the data values will be scaled to -1 to +1 range.
*     NWS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimension of the WS work space which must be at least
*        4 * (MAXVAL + 4 * NKNOT).
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of data points to be fitted by least-squares.
*     MAXVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum dimension of the data, weight and co-ordinate
*        vectors.  This should be no less than EL + 2.
*     X( MAXVAL ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The co-ordinates of the points to be evaluated.
*     Z( MAXVAL ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The values at the given positions.
*     W( MAXVAL ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The weights at the given positions.
*     PERM( MAXVAL ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace for permutation index need to sort the data into
*        ascending position.
*     KNOT( MXKNOT ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The positions of complete set of knots in the same co-ordinates
*        as array X.
*     COEFF( MXKNOT ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The cubic B-spline coefficients, defined at the knots.
*        There will be NCOEF=NKNOT+8 coefficients for an interpolating
*        spline.
*     NCOEF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of spline coefficients.
*     WS( NWS ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     IWS( MXKNOT ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     FACTOR = REAL (Returned)
*        The scale factor applied to the data values before calculating
*        the spline.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The smoothing spline fit uses a smoothing factor S that must be
*     determined.  The routine first determines upper and lower limits
*     of S.  The upper is the weighted sum of the squares of the
*     residuals of the least-squares cubic polynomial fit.  The lower
*     limit comes from an estimation of the overall noise from averaging
*     the standard deviations in typically 50 segments and then combined
*     with a 3-sigma clip to exclude line features.  The purpose of the
*     segments is to exclude the trend from the calculation.
*     -  The value of S is decreased progressively more slowly until
*     the maximum number of knots or the miniumum value of S is
*     reached, or the residuals increase.  During iterations the initial
*     knots are used.
*     -  A final fit is made with the chosen S, but now finding the
*     knots afresh.
*     -  In some cases, the noise in the trend vector is much greater
*     than suggested by the weights supplied.  These are identified
*     from their upper limit being less than their lower limit for S.
*     An experimental fudge smooths the data and recalculates the lower
*     limit.  If the minimum still exceeds the upper limit, the lower
*     limits is set arbitrarily to 40% of the upper limit in order to
*     create some knots.  The smoothing appears not to work on data
*     tested thus far, and may need reworking, or simply removed,
*     leaving the user to fit these by another method or mask them
*     before fitting.  It may just be that the spline fitting
*     algorithm breaks down for data where the noise dominates any
*     trend.
