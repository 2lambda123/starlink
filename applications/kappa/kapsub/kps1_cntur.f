*     Contour an image quickly.

*  Description:
*     The routine plots a contour map of a two-dimensional sub-array.
*     It is optimised for speed of execution.  It uses a linked list to
*     keep track of which cells of pixels have already been contoured
*     to avoid unnecessary searching of all pixels at each contour
*     level.  All line segments are drawn as straight lines without
*     smoothing.
*
*     There is an option to draw to the plotting resolution, i.e.
*     sub-pixel segments, otherwise it is only single pixel resolution.
*     This slows down the contouring.  If speed is of the essence, then
*     this option should not be used.  (Subroutine J06GBF in application
*     CONTOUR has better sub-pixel plotting algorithms that smooth the
*     contours giving rounded images.)
*
*     A log of contour heights actually plotted is made.   Contours may
*     be annotated, the frequency with contour level may be defined.
*     If no annotations are used then the SGS pens which draw the
*     contours may be cycled modulo 3 for each height used, and so
*     assist in identification.  A threshold may be set below which
*     contours are drawn with different pens (usually dashed).

*  Arguments:
*     DIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the two-dimensional array.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the two-dimensional array.
*     ARRAY( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        Input array of data.
*     XSTART = INTEGER (Given)
*        X start co-ordinate of the sub-array to be contoured.
*     YSTART = INTEGER (Given)
*        Y start co-ordinate of the sub-array to be contoured.
*     XSIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        X size of the sub-array to be contoured.
*     YSIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        Y size of the sub-array to be contoured.
*     WKDIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the LINK and FLAG arrays.
*     WKDIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the LINK and FLAG arrays.
*     NCONT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of contour levels.
*     CONT( NCONT ) = REAL (Given)
*        The contour levels. These should be in increasing order.
*     DX = REAL (Given)
*        The x resolution of the contour segments, i.e. only contour
*        segments longer than this will be plotted.
*     DY = REAL (Given)
*        The y resolution of the contour segments, i.e. only contour
*        segments longer than this will be plotted.
*     ANNOTA = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., the contours are to be annotated with contour
*        numbers.
*     NOISY = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., annotations are written to a given contour at twice
*        the frequency.
*     LABFRQ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The frequency of annotated contours as the contour level
*        changes, thus 1 means all contour levels will be annotated.
*     PENROT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., and no annotation is being performed the three pens
*        drawing the contours will be cycled.
*     THRESH = REAL (Given)
*        The threshold below which pen 5 will be used for plotting, or
*        pens 5 to 7 if PENROT = .TRUE..  A bad value means that pen 2,
*        or pens 2 to 4 respectively are used.
*     MAXRES = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., contours will be interpolated between pixels to the
*        resolutions DX and DY.
*     NLOCUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of segments that can be stored, and should
*        be comfortably large enough to hold the longest contour
*        allowing for sub-pixel resolution if that option is selected.
*     XP( NLOCUS ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work array to store the contour locus, x positions.

*     LINK( WKDIM1 * WKDIM2 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Work space for the pointers linking contourable array cells in
*        a series of linked lists.
*     FLAG( WKDIM1 * WKDIM2 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Work space to flag which array cells have been contoured.
*     CNTUSD( NCONT ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If an element is .TRUE., the contour level corresponding to
*        that element has been used.
*     STATUS  = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Notes:
*     -  Magic-value bad pixels are correctly processed.
*     -  Uses pen 2 for plotting.  5 also is used when there is a
*     threshold set.  For pen rotation these become pens 2 to 4 without
*     a threshold, and 5 to 7 with a threshold.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check inherited status
*     Initialise line patterns for annotated contours, or store the pen
*       number for cyclic pens
*     Compute the size of the notional sub-pixel array when required
*     Scan through the rectangular region of the array specified,
*       dividing it into panels.
*     For each panel
*        Locate the contourable cells and asociate them in linked lists
*        For each contour
*           Initialise a flag for all the cells in the crowded-cell list
*           For simple then crowded cells
*              Loop through all cells linked to the starting cell that
*                have not already been contoured
*                 Extract the pixel values for the four corners of the
*                   cell
*                 Determine which edges of the cell are crossed by the
*                   contour
*                 If at least one cell is crossed by the contour then
*                    Note that the contour level has been used
*                    Loop to follow the contour line
*                       Compute the fractional intersections along the
*                         crossed edges
*                       Allow for the special case when all four edges
*                         are crossed, switching the connnections
*                         between sides if the previous cell's exit side
*                         was the bottom, or by dividing the cell into
*                         triangles
*                       Initialise last-contour plotted if the contour
*                         tracking has just begun and store the first
*                         point in the contour locus
*                       If sub-pixel resolution required compute the
*                         locus within the cell and update the last
*                         position
*                       Store the exit point from the cell if it is
*                         longer than the resolution or there is only
*                         one point stored so far
*                       If the cell has two line segments then
*                          Plot the second one, with sub-pixel
*                            resolution if requested and to the plotting
*                            resolution, via NCAR for annotated contours
*                            otherwise by GKS directly
*                          Exit the contour-tracing loop
*                       Endif
*                       Record that contour tracking has started and
*                         side it left the cell
*                       For a given exit side shift the X or Y position
*                         by a pixel, exiting the contour-tracking loop
*                         if the cell lies outside the panel or the
*                         cell has already been contoured. Compute which
*                         sides the contour crosses excluding the side
*                         it entered
*                    Endfor
*                    If there is more than one point to plot use NCAR
*                      curve-drawing routine to plot annotated contours,
*                      or GKS polyline with option pen rotation
*                      otherwise
*                 Endif
*                 Find next cell which may contain the current contour
*                   level
*              Endfor
*           Endfor
*        Endfor
*     Endfor
*     End

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Does not handle contours that pass through the cell corners well.
*     The sub-pixel resolution is only partially successful, and
*     requires a smoothing technique.  The number of segments is not
*     checked that it does not exceed the buffer size, because of
*     efficiency reasons.  Needs to handle smoothing options for
*     sub-pixel resolution.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  This routine uses SGS, NCAR and GKS graphics. The GKS device
*     must already be open.
*     -  If the threshold is set, pen 5 should be a dashed form of pen
*     2.  When pen rotation is also requested pens 6 and 7 are dashed
*     forms of pens 3 and 4.

*  History:
*     26-SEP-1988 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     1989 Aug 26 (MJC):
*        Completed prologue; added many extra arguments and options
*        (e.g. annotation, pen rotation, sub-pixel plotting to the
*        resolution); improved checks to prevent crossing contours.
*     1989 Oct 20 (MJC):
*        Somehow an old version crept in which no longer drew the
*        correct annotations --- now corrected.
*     1991 Oct 22 (MJC):
*        Looks like it's happened again.  Corrected the annotation
*        dashed-line selection (ignores number of points).  Also
*        decreased length of dashed patterns by 50 per cent.
*     1997 May (MJC):
*        Renamed from CNTTUR.  Used modern style prologue and
*        commenting.  Added THRESH argument (for dashed lines).
