      SUBROUTINE KPS1_ELPR4( EL, MASK, NBIN, AXCEN, MOUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_ELPR4

*  Purpose:
*     Creates an output mask for ELPROF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_ELPR4( EL, MASK, NBIN, AXCEN, MOUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An output image is created in which each pixel value is
*     determined from the corresponding pixel in the supplied mask
*     image.  If the supplied value is zero (i.e. if the input pixel
*     was not included in any bin), then the output pixel is set bad.
*     Otherwise, the corresponding central bin value is looked up
*     (using AXCEN) and stored in the output pixel.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in the two images.
*     MASK( EL ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The mask created by KPS1_ELPR3.
*     NBIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of bins in the profile.
*     AXCEN( NBIN ) = REAL (Given)
*        The central axis value (radius or azimuthal angle) for each
*        bin.
*     MOUT( EL ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The returned mask.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
