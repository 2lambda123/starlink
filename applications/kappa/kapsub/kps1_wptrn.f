      SUBROUTINE KPS1_WPTRN( TR, LOC, NAME, COMM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_WPTRN

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a transform structure for a two-dimensional polar
*     transform.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_WPTRN( TR, LOC, NAME, COMM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine creates the forward and inverse mappings for a
*     two-dimensional polar transform whose coefficients are given by
*     the TR array.  The mappings are stored using TRANSFORM in the
*     object pointed to by LOC.

*  Arguments:
*     TR( 3 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The coefficients of the polar transformation.  In order these
*        are the Cartesian origin (x then y), and the orientation origin
*        measured from the x-axis anticlockwise.
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Locator to structure in which transformation is to be stored.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the transformation structure.  It must not bbe
*        longer than DAT__SZNAM characters.
*     COMM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Comment to be added to transform structure.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
