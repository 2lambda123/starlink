      SUBROUTINE KPS1_LFTSV( ORDER, A, INITA, B, WRK1, WRK2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_LFTSV

*  Purpose:
*     Solve least-squares equations for fitting a polynomial.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_LFTSV( ORDER, A, INITA, B, WRK1, WRK2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine solves a system of linear equations in a least-
*     squares sense for the FITLINE application.

*  Arguments:
*     ORDER = INTEGER (Given)
*        The order of polynomial which will be fit using these matrices.
*     A( ORDER + 1, ORDER + 1 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Matrix holding power X sums (A in Ax=B).
*     INITA = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., then the A matrix should factored.  If .FALSE., it
*        has already been factored on a previous call and can be reused
*        to solve another B immediately.  When reusing A you must also
*        return the same WRK2. 
*     B( ORDER + 1 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Y times power X sums (B in Ax=B).  On exit it contains the
*        polynomial coefficients.
*     WRK1( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace of size (ORDER+1).
*     WRK2( * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace of size (ORDER+1).  Re-used when INITA is .FALSE.
