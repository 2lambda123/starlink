      SUBROUTINE KPS1_BS2GE( LOC, MXPAR, NXKNOT, NYKNOT, XKNOT, YKNOT,

*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_BS2GE

*  Purpose:
*     Reads two-dimensional B-spline information from a POLYNOMIAL
*     structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_BS2GE( LOC, MXPAR, NXKNOT, NYKNOT, XKNOT, YKNOT, SCALE, 
*                      COEFF, WORK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine reads information describing a two-dimensional
*     bi-cubic B-spline polynomial surface from a standard Starlink 
*     POLYNOMIAL structure, as defined in SGP/38 and extended to 
*     B-splines.  All floating-point information within the structure is
*     returned as single precision.
*
*     It is assumed the calling programme needs a one-dimensional array
*     of coefficients, where COEFF( ( IX - 1 ) * ( NYKNOT + 4 ) + IY )
*     contains the coefficient for the (IX,IY)th term (with NYKNOT + 4
*     being the total number of Y terms).  Such a one-dimensional array 
*     is used by the PDA_SURFIT and PDA_BISPEV routines and defined in
*     the NAG manual (see Chapter E02 on "Curve and Surface fitting").
*
*     This routine will convert the two-dimensional coefficient array
*     from the POLYNOMIAL structure (in the format described in SGP/38
*     and extended to B-splines in KPS1_PL2PU), and load a flipped 
*     version of this into the required one-dimensional array.
*
*     The routine will also read the knot positions in _INTEGER type
*     array KNOTS (or XKNOTS and YKNOTS for older data), and a 
*     data-scaling factor in SCALE of type _REAL.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER*( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given)
*        Locator to the existing POLYNOMIAL structure.
*     MXPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of coefficients in either x or y.  The
*        declared size of the coefficient arrays given to this routine
*        is assumed to be MXPAR * MXPAR (see below).  It should be set
*        to the maximum number of interior knots per axis plus four.
*     NXKNOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of x interior knots.
*     NYKNOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of y interior knots.
*     XKNOT( MXPAR + 4 ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The x positions of complete set of knots associated with x.
*     YKNOT( MXPAR + 4 ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The y positions of complete set of knots associated with y.
*     SCALE = REAL (Returned)
*        The scale factor applied to the data values before calculating
*        the spline.
*     COEFF( MXPAR * MXPAR ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Array of B-spline polynomial coefficients, in the format used 
*        by NAG and PDA routines (see KPS1_SUSF).
*     WORK( MXPAR, MXPAR ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work array containing the two-dimensional array of 
*        coefficients as read from the POLYNOMIAL structure.
*     STATUS =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.

*  Notes:
*     -  Uses the magic-value method for bad or undefined pixels.

*     2007 July 4 (MJC):
*        Original version derived from KPG1_PL2GE.
*     2009 December 17 (MJC):
*        Use a single generic concatenated KNOTS vector as now 
*        documented in SGP/38, but for compatibility with older data
*        test for XKNOTS and YKNOTS components if KNOTS is absent.
*     2009 December 19 (MJC):
*        Use known values to declare XKNOT and YKNOT dimensions.
