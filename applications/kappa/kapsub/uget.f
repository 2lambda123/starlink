      SUBROUTINE UGET( J, K, N )
*+
*  Name:
*     UGET

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a block of an external area for MEMSYS3.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL UGET( J, K, N )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine is called directly by the MEMSYS3 library.  It
*     transfers N elements from external storage to the internal work
*     arrays held in common block /MECOMS/.  The external storage is
*     assumed to be in the form of a continuous 1-d vector.  The given
*     argument J is the index within this external storage vector of
*     the first element to be transferred.  This element is copied to
*     element K of the internal work array ME_ST.

*  Arguments:
*     J = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the external storage vector of the
*        first element to be transfered.
*     K = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the internal work array at which the first
*        element is to be stored.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements to be transferred.
