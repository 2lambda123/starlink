* Name:
*     KPS1_ELPR1

*  Purpose:
*     Creates an ARD description for a set of elliptical annuli.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_ELPR1( NX, NY, PA, RATIO, NSTEP, RSTEP, RMIN, WID, XC,
*                      YC, PA1, PA2, USESEC, REGVAL, IGRP, REGIND,

*  Description:
*     An identifier for a GRP group is returned which holds an ARD
*     description defining a set of elliptical annuli described by the
*     supplied arguments.  The central radius, and width of each bin are
*     also returned, together with the bin number corresponding to each
*     mask value (i.e. the integer values in the mask which will be
*     created by ARD_WORK).

*  Arguments:
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the image to which the ARD description
*        applies.
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the image to which the ARD description
*        applies.
*     PA = REAL (Given)
*        The angle between the major axis of the ellipses and the first
*        axis, given in radians measured anti-clockwise.
*     RATIO = REAL (Given)
*        The ratio of the minor- to major-axis lengths.  In the range
*        zero to one.
*     NSTEP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of annuli required.
*     RSTEP = REAL (Given)
*        The step between centres of adjacent annuli in pixels,
*        measured along the major axis.  This must be no smaller than
*        WID.
*     RMIN = REAL (Given)
*        The radius (measured on the major axis) of the inner edge of
*        the inner-most annulus.
*     WID = REAL (Given)
*        The width of each annulus in pixels, measured along the major
*        axis.
*     XC = REAL (Given)
*        The x pixel co-ordinate of the ellipse centre.
*     YC = REAL (Given)
*        The y pixel co-ordinate of the ellipse centre.
*     PA1 = REAL (Given)
*        The angle between the x axis and the first of the two radii
*        defining the sector in which the annuli are to be used.  Given
*        in radians in the range 0 - 2 pi, and measured positive anti-
*        clockwise.  The sector is that defined by moving
*        anti-clockwise from PA1 to PA2.  It is only used if USESEC is
*        .TRUE.
*     PA2 = REAL (Given)
*        The angle between the x axis and the second of the two radii
*        defining the sector in which the annuli are to be used.  Given
*        in radians in the range 0 - 2 pi, and measured positive anti-
*        clockwise.  It is only used if USESEC is .TRUE.
*     USESEC = LOGICAL (Given)
*        It is .TRUE. if the annuli are to be restricted to the
*        intersection with the sector defined by PA1 and PA2.
*        Otherwise, the ARD description describes the entirity of each
*        annulus.
*     REGVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value which will be passed to subroutine ARD_WORK as the
*        value to use to represent the first region included in the 
*        ARD description.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP identifier for a group containing the ARD description.
*        This group should be deleted using GRP_DELET when it is no
*        longer needed.
*     REGIND( * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index within REGVAL at which each regions radial distance
*        is stored.  The supplied array should be at least 2+2*NSTEP
*        elements long.  This array is indexed using the positive
*        integer values which subroutine ARD_WORK uses to represent
*        each region.
*     REGCEN( NSTEP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The radial distance to the centre of each annulus, in pixels. 
*     REGWID( NSTEP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The width of each annulus, in pixels. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
