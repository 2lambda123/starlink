*  Name:
*     KPS1_AGNCP

*  Purpose:
*     Get screen positions defining an ARD region for ARDGEN.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_AGNCP( IPLOT, ARDDEF, MXPNT, NPTS, X1, X2, Y1, Y2, INFO, 
*                      XCUR, YCUR, NP, X, Y, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine enables use of the cursor on the current graphics
*     device to select a defined number of points whose co-ordinates
*     are returned.  Only positions within the defined limits are
*     accepted.

*  Arguments:
*     IPLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*       The Plot defining plotting colours, etc., and the Mapping from
*       PGPLOT world coords to the required user coordinate system.
*     ARDDEF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        User selected ARD region keyword.
*     MXPNT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Maximum number of points which can be supplied.
*     NPTS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of points to be determined using the cursor. If ARDDEF is 
*        'POLYGON', NPTS is ignored, and the user can supply up to MXPNT
*        points.
*     X1 = REAL (Given)
*        Lower graphics x co-ordinate that defines the region in which all
*        points selected by the cursor must lie.
*     X2 = REAL (Given)
*        Upper graphics x co-ordinate that defines the region in which all
*        points selected by the cursor must lie.
*     Y1 = REAL (Given)
*        Lower y graphics co-ordinate that defines the region in which all
*        points selected by the cursor must lie.
*     Y2 = REAL (Given)
*        Upper y graphics co-ordinate that defines the region in which all
*        points selected by the cursor must lie.
*     INFO = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Display information about button usage? Returned equal to .FALSE.
*     XCUR = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        X co-ordinate of the position where the cursor will first
*        appear.  This is usually the last location of the cursor
*        or the centre of the picture.
*     YCUR = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Y co-ordinate of the position where the cursor will first
*        appear.
*     NP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of points obtained with the cursor.  
*     X( MXPNT ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The axis 1 co-ordinates of the points measured by the cursor, in
*        the current Frame of IPLOT.
*     Y( MXPNT ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The axis 2 co-ordinates of the points measured by the cursor, in
*        the current Frame of IPLOT.
*     STATUS  = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.
