*  Name:
*     KPS1_PLMSK

*  Purpose:
*     Inserts a polygon into a a 2-dimensional logical mask identifying
*     pixels which are inside any polygon.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_PLMSK( NPOLY, LBND1, UBND1, LBND2, UBND2, NVERT, XVERT, 
*                      YVERT, MASK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A polygonal region of the mask array is defined by the
*     co-ordinates supplied in arguments XVERT and YVERT.  Mask pixels
*     which have centres within the polygon are returned set to .TRUE.
*     and others are returned unchanged.  If NPOLY is supplied equal to
*     zero, then all mask pixels are initially set to .FALSE.

*  Arguments:
*     NPOLY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of polygons previously added into the mask.
*     LBND1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bound of the first axis of the mask array.
*     UBND1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bound of the first axis of the mask array.
*     LBND2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bound of the second axis of the mask array.
*     UBND2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bound of the second axis of the mask array.
*     NVERT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of vertices in the polygon.
*     XVERT( NVERT ) = REAL (Given)
*        The pixel co-ordinates of the vertices on the first axis.
*     YVERT( NVERT ) = REAL (Given)
*        The pixel co-ordinates of the vertices on the second axis.
*     MASK( LBND1:UBND1, LBND2:UBND2 ) = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        The returned mask.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
