      SUBROUTINE KPS1_FRARE( JUST, FRACT, ASPECT, X1, X2, Y1, Y2,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_FRARE

*  Purpose:
*     Defines a region within the current SGS zone.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_FRARE( JUST, FRACT, ASPECT, X1, X2, Y1, Y2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine defines a two-dimensional region in the current
*     SGS zone.  The region is defined by the given position
*     justification, and the linear fraction along each axis of the
*     current SGS zone; and an aspect ratio.  The linear fraction is
*     applied first followed by the aspect-ratio constraint.

*  Arguments:
*     JUST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Justification of the new region specified by a two-character
*        code.  The first character controls the vertical location, and
*        may be T, B, or C to create the new region at the top, bottom,
*        or in the centre respectively.  The second defines the
*        horizontal situation, and may be L, R, or C to define a new
*        region to the left, right, or in the centre respectively.
*        Thus a code of BR will make a new region in the bottom-right
*        corner.  The justification code need not be in uppercase.
*     FRACT( 2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The fractional size of the new region applied along each axis.
*        So values of 0.5,0.5 would create a picture 0.25 the area of
*        the current zone.
*     ASPECT  = REAL (Given)
*        The aspect ratio of the new region (x/y).  If the value is
*        negative, no aspect-ratio constraint is applied to define the
*        new region.
*     X1 = REAL (Returned)
*        Lower x world co-ordinate in the current zone of the new
*        region.
*     X2 = REAL (Returned)
*        Upper x world co-ordinate in the current zone of the new
*        region.
*     Y1 = REAL (Returned)
*        Lower y world co-ordinate in the current zone of the new
*        region.
*     Y2 = REAL (Returned)
*        Upper y world co-ordinate in the current zone of the new
*        region.
*     STATUS  = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     Get bounds of the zone, the position of its centre and its size
*     Get the vertical limit from the code using the zone bounds,
*       reporting an error should the code be invalid
*     Get the horizontal limit from the code using the zone bounds,
*       reporting an error should the code be invalid
*     End

*  Prior Requiremnts:
*     There must be an SGS workstation open.
