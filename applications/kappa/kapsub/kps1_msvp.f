      SUBROUTINE KPS1_MSVP( IGRP, NNDF, VAR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_MSVP

*  Purpose:
*     Determines the presence of VARIANCE components in a group
*     of NDFs for MSTATS.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MSVP( IGRP, NNDF, VARSTATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine tests a supplied group of NDFs for the presence of a 
*     VARIANCE component in all of them.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identifier of a group of NDFs to be examined.
*     NNDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of NDFs in the group (size of IGRP).
*     VAR = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        This is set .TRUE. if all the NDFs within the supplied group
*        have VARIANCE components, and .FALSE> otherwise.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  See if the input NDF has a VARIANCE component.
