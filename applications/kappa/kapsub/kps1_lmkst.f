*  Name:
*     KPS1_LMKST

*  Purpose:
*     Copy given positions to the output positions list created by LISTMAKE.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_LMKST( NAX, NPIN, INDIM, INPOS, ID0, INID, START, NPOUT,
*                      OUTPOS, OUTID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine copies positions and identifiers from the input
*     arrays to the output arrays, starting at a given index within the
*     output arrays.

*  Arguments:
*     NAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of axes for the supplied positions.
*     NPIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of supplied positions.
*     INDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the first dimension of the input positions array.
*        Must be no smaller than NPIN.
*     INPOS( INDIM, NAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The supplied positions.
*     ID0 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The integer identifier value to associate with the first
*        supplied position. Identifiers for subsequent positions increase
*        by 1 for each position. If this is supplied less than or equal
*        to zero, then its value is ignored and the identifiers supplied
*        in array INID are used instead.
*     INID( NPIN ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The individual integer identifiers to associate with each
*        supplied position. Only accessed if ID0 is less than or equal to
*        zero.
*     START = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within the output arrays at which to store the first
*        supplied position.
*     NPOUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the first dimension of array OUTPOS.
*     OUTPOS( NPOUT, NAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The returned positions.
*     OUTID( NPOUT ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The returned position identifiers.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.
