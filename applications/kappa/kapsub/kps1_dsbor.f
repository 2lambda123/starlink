      SUBROUTINE KPS1_DSBOR( XL, XU, YL, YU, BORWID, BORCI, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_DSBOR

*  Purpose:
*     Plots a border about a rectangular region.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_DSBOR( XL, XU, YL, YU, BORWID, BORCI, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine plots a coloured border about a rectangular region
*     within the current viewport or zone.  Clipping may occur if the
*     border lies outside the current viewport or zone.  Four separate
*     cell arrays are drawn for each side of the border.
*
*     A bad status is returned if there is an error within GKS itself
*     during plotting of the cell arrays.

*  Arguments:
*     XL = REAL (Given)
*        The lower x world co-ordinate bound of the rectangular region
*        to be surrounded by a border.
*     XU = REAL (Given)
*        The upper x world co-ordinate bound of the rectangular region
*        to be surrounded by a border.
*     YL = REAL (Given)
*        The lower y world co-ordinate bound of the rectangular region
*        to be surrounded by a border.
*     YU = REAL (Given)
*        The upper y world co-ordinate bound of the rectangular region
*        to be surrounded by a border.
*     BORWID( 2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The width of the border in the x and y directions.
*     BORCI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The colour index of the border.  It should lie within the
*        range of colour indices for the display device.  This routine
*        does not check this.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  GKS or SGS should be active and there should be a current
*     viewport or zone.
