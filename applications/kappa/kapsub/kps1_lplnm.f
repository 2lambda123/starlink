      SUBROUTINE KPS1_LPLNM( FRM, IAXIS, DIM, NDIM, POS, AXVAL, BAD, 
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_LPLNM

*  Purpose:
*     Normalise a set of axis values for LINPLOT.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_LPLNM( FRM, IAXIS, DIM, NDIM, POS, AXVAL, BAD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine normalises the supplied positions using the supplied
*     Frame, and then copies the value on axis IAXIS into the returned
*     array. A flag is returned if any bad values are found.

*  Arguments:
*     FRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to the Frame in which the positions are defined.
*     IAXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the Frame axis which is to be extracted and returned
*        in AXVAL.
*     DIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of positions.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of axes in FRM.
*     POS( DIM, NDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The positions.
*     AXVAL( DIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The normalised axis values.
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Any bad values in returned array?
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.
