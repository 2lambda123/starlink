      SUBROUTINE KPS1_MLPMP( NAX, FRM, MAP, NPOS, IN, FORWRD, IAXIS,

*  Name:
*     KPS1_MLPMP

*  Purpose:
*     Maps a set of 1D positions, normalizing the returned values.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MLPMP( NAX, FRM, MAP, NPOS, IN, FORWRD, IAXIS, OUT, WORK,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine maps the supplied 1D positions using the specified
*     Mapping. This mapping maps the 1D positions into the supplied
*     nD Frame. These positions are then normalized using the AST_NORM
*     method for the supplied Frame, and the resulting values for a
*     requested axis are returned.

*  Arguments:
*     NAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of axes in FRM.
*     FRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The AST Frame decribing the positions produced by the transformation
*        specified by MAP and FORWRD.
*     MAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The AST Mapping.
*     NPOS = INTEGER (Given)
*        No. of positions to map.
*     IN( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The input 1D positions.
*     FORWRD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Use the forward transformation of MAP?
*     IAXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the required output axis within FRM.
*     OUT( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The required normalized output axis values.
*     WORK( NPOS, NAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Work space. 
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.
