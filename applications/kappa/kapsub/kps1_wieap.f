*  Name:
*     KPS1_WIEAP

*  Purpose:
*     Applies a pre-calculated Wiener filter to a supplied image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_WIEAP( BAD, WLIM, EL, M, N, FILE_3, FILE_4, FILE_2,
*                      FILE_6, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     If no bad pixels are present in the input image, then its FT is
*     found and multiplied by the supplied filter function FT.  The
*     inverse FFT is taken of the resulting product to get the returned
*     image.
*
*     If there are any bad pixels in the input image, then these are
*     replaced by zero before doing the filtering.  By itself, this
*     would result in incorrect normalisation for any output pixels
*     affected by these zero values.  To correct this, a mask image is
*     formed holding the weight of every input pixel.  This is set to 1
*     for good pixels and 0 for bad pixels.  This mask image is also
*     filtered using the same filter, to get the weight of good pixels
*     at each output pixel.  Output pixels which have too low a weight
*     (as determined by WLIM) are set bad in the returned array. Others
*     are normalised by dividing the filtered image value by the
*     filtered mask value.

*  Arguments:
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        It is .TRUE. if there may be any bad values in file 4.
*     WLIM = REAL (Given)
*        The lowest weight of good input pixels for which a good output
*        pixel should be produced.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        Total number of elements in each internal file.
*     M = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of columns in the 2-d form of each internal file.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of rows in the 2-d form of each internal file.
*     FILE_3( EL ) = REAL (Given)
*        The Fourier transform of the Wiener-filter function.  Stored
*        in Hermitian form (see KPS1_WIEFL).
*     FILE_4( EL ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Supplied holding the input image.  Returned holding the
*        filtered input image.
*     FILE_2( EL ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     FILE_6( EL ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
