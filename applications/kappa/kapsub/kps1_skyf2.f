*  Name:
*     KPS1_SKYF2

*  Purpose:
*     Form an initial guess at the IRA projection parameters which
*     will describe the supplied co-ordinate data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_SKYF2( IGRP, ORIENT, PSIZE, TILT, REFIMG, REFSKY, SCS,
*                      NP, NPOS, P, PC, AA, BB, XX, YY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The formatted co-ordinate data supplied in the group identified by
*     IGRP is converted to floating-point format and stored in the
*     supplied arrays.  A guess at the IRA projection parameters which
*     relate the two sets of co-ordinates (sky and image) is then found.
*     The reference position is taken as the first supplied position.
*     The pixels size (pixels are initially assumed to be square) and
*     the image orientation are determined by the finding the
*     arc-distance and bearing of the second supplied position from the
*     first.  The celestial sphere is asummed not to have been tilted
*     before projection.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for a group holding the supplied co-ordinate
*        data.  Each set of 4 adjacent elements should contain formatted
*        versions of the sky longitude, sky latitude, image X and image
*        Y co-ordinates.  Blank elements should have been removed from
*        this group before-hand.
*     ORIENT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific value supplied by the user for the position
*        angle of the image Y axis?
*     PSIZE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific value supplied by the user for the pixel size?
*     TILT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific value supplied by the user for the tilt of the
*        celestial sphere prior to projection?
*     REFIMG = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific value supplied by the user for the image
*        co-ordinates of the reference point.
*     REFSKY = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific value supplied by the user for the sky
*        co-ordinates of the reference point.
*     SCS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The sky co-ordinate system in which the longitude and latitude
*        values contained in the group identified by IRGP are given.
*     NP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of array P.
*     NPOS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of positions in the group identified by IGRP.
*     P( NP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Any projection parameters which were specified by the user.  If
*        the arguments TILT, ORIENT, PSIZE, REFIMG and REFSKY indicate
*        that a value has not been supplied for a particular parameter,
*        then the corresponding element of P is ignored.
*     PC( NP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The initial guess projection parameters, combining those
*        supplied in P with initial guesses for those not supplied in P.
*     AA( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The sky longitude values read from the group identified by IGRP.
*     BB( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The sky latitude values read from the group identified by IGRP.
*     XX( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The image X values read from the group identified by IGRP.
*     YY( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The image Y values read from the group identified by IGRP.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
