      SUBROUTINE TROPUS( K, J )
*+
*  Name:
*     TROPUS

*  Purpose:
*     Creates an image using the transposed response matrix.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TROPUS( K, J )

*  Description:
*     This routine calls a lower level routine to do the work.  The
*     data are smoothed with the PSF to produce the output image.  This
*     is done in Fourier space using the FFT of the PSF stored in file
*     <3>.  The output image has a blank margin around it to reduce
*     wrap-around effects at the image edges.

*  Arguments:
*     K = INTEGER (Given)
*        The internal file number holding the data set from which the
*        image is to be created.
*     J = INTEGER (Given)
*        The internal file number to hold the created image.

*  Global Variables:

      INCLUDE 'C1_COM'           ! Common blocks use to communicate with

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER  J
      INTEGER  K

*.

*  Call a lower level routine to do the work.  Find the MEMSYS3 areas
*  either in a dynamically allocated external work array, or in
*  internal memory within common block /MECOMS/.  Area <3> holds the FFT
*  of the PSF.
      IF ( C1_WEXT ) THEN
         CALL KPS1_TROP1( %VAL( CNF_PVAL( C1_IP( 3 ) ) ), 
     :                    %VAL( CNF_PVAL( C1_IP( K ) ) ),
     :                    %VAL( CNF_PVAL( C1_IP( J ) ) ) )

*  Pad the external area out with zeros.  This puts zeros between the
*  last image pixel and the end of the area (areas can be bigger than
*  images because of the need to have an integer number of buffers in
*  each area).  This simulates a response function of zero at these
*  pixels.
         CALL KPS1_MEMFX( ME_MK * ME_NK, C1_NPX * C1_NLN, 
     :                    %VAL( CNF_PVAL( C1_IP( J ) ) ) )
