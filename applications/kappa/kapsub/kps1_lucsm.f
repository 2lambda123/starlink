      SUBROUTINE KPS1_LUCSM( N, NPIX, NLIN, WLIM, TRANS, PSF, IN,

*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_LUCSM

*  Purpose:
*     Smooths an array potentially containing bad pixels.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_LUCSM( N, NPIX, NLIN, WLIM, TRANS, PSF, IN,
*                      MASK, WORK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A mask is created holding 1 at every good data pixel, and zero at
*     every bad data pixel.  This mask is smoothed (by multiplying the
*     Fourier transforms of the mask and the PSF) to obtain the weight
*     of the good input pixels which contribute to each output pixel (a
*     value of 1.0 in the smoothed mask array means all contributing
*     input pixels were good, and a value of 0.0 means none of the
*     contributing pixels were good).  The bad values in the supplied
*     data array are replaced by zero and the data array is then
*     smoothed.  The effect of the differing number of contributing
*     pixels is then normalised out by dividing the smoothed data array
*     by the smoothed mask array.  Output pixels for which less than a
*     fraction WLIM of the input contibuting input pixels were good are
*     set bad in the returned array.
*
*     If the input data array does not, in fact, contain any bad
*     pixels, then it is just smoothed normally without creating the
*     associated mask (which would contain 1.0 at every pixel if it
*     were to be created).  This reduces the execution time by about
*     50%.

*  Arguments:
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in each internal file.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels per line in each internal file.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines in each internal file.
*     WLIM = REAL (Given)
*        The weight limit for good pixels.
*     TRANS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE. the array is to be smoothed with the transposed PSF.
*     PSF( N ) = REAL (Given)
*        The Fourier transform of the PSF.
*     IN( N ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The array to be smoothed.
*     MASK( N ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space. 
*     WORK( N ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
