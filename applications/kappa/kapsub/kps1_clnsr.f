      SUBROUTINE KPS1_CLNSR( LBND, UBND, XCEN, X, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_CLNSx

*  Purpose:
*     To 'clean' a marginal star profile, removing neighbouring stars
*     and blemishes.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_CLNSx( LBND, UBND, XCEN, X, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine cleans a marginal star profile by subtracting the
*     lower quartile data point as a background estimate.  It works
*     out from the centre of the star, preventing each data point from
*     exceeding the maximum of the two previous data values.  This
*     ensures that the data does not increase with increasing distance
*     from the centre.

*  Arguments:
*     LBND = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bound of the data array.
*     UBND = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bound of the data array.
*     XCEN = REAL (Given)
*        The estimated position of the star centre.
*     X( LBND:UBND ) = ? (Given and Returned)
*        The marginal data array.  On exit it is cleaned and background
*        subtracted.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     There is a routine for each numeric data type: replace "x" in the
*     routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B, UB as appropriate.  The array
*     supplied to the routine must have the data type specified.
