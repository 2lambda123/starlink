*  Name:
*     KPS1_PSEVL

*  Purpose:
*     Evaluates a model 2-d point-spread function over an array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_PSEVL( AMP, AXISR, THETA, FWHM, GAMMA, LBND1, UBND1,
*                      LBND2, UBND2, PX, PY, ARRAY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine evaluates within an array a point-spread function
*     of the following radial form:
*        D =  A exp(-0.5 * (r/sigma) ** gamma )
*     where r is calculated from the true radial distance from the star
*     centre allowing for image ellipticity, sigma is the Gaussian
*     precision constant or profile width.  The point-spread function
*     may be oriented at an arbitrary angle.  The centre of the
*     point-spread function is at the supplied psoition (PX,PY).

*        The full width at half maximum of the point-spread function in
*        the minor-axis direction.
