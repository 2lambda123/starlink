      SUBROUTINE KPS1_MEMNM( DEF, NPIX, NLIN, FILE1, FILE20, FILE22,
     :                       FILE2, OUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_MEMNM

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a new default model image in a maximum-entropy
*     reconstruction.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MEMNM( DEF, NPIX, NLIN, FILE1, FILE20, FILE22, FILE2, 
*                      OUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The new model is a linear combination of the old model and the
*     current hidden reconstruction. The proportions of each of these
*     two images in the new model varies from pixel to pixel.  Pixels
*     which have a high entropy in the current hidden reconstruction are
*     determined by the current hidden reconstruction, where as pixels
*     with a low entropy are determined by the old model.

*  Arguments:
*     DEF = REAL (Given)
*        The value used for the MEM3 argument DEF.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels per line in the output image.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines in the output image.
*     FILE1( * ) = REAL (Given)
*        File <1> - the current reconstruction.
*     FILE20( * ) = REAL (Given)
*        File <20> - the current model.
*     FILE22( * ) = REAL (Given)
*        File <22> - the data accuracies.
*     FILE2( * ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Used as work space.
*     OUT( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The output image to hold the new model.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
