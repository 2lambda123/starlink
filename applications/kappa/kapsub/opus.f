      SUBROUTINE OPUS( J, K )
*+
*  Name:
*     OPUS

*  Purpose:
*     Create a simulated data set.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL OPUS( J, K )

*  Description:
*     This routine calls a lower level routine to do the work.  The data
*     is produced by smoothing the input image with the PSF.  This is
*     done in Fourier space using the FFT of the PSF stored in file <3>.
*     The input image will have a blank margin around it to reduce
*     wrap-around effects at the image edges.

*  Arguments:
*     J = INTEGER (Given)
*        The internal file number holding the image from which data is
*        to be simulated.
*     K = INTEGER (Given)
*        The internal file number to hold the simulated data set.

*  Type Definitions:
      IMPLICIT NONE              ! No implicit typing

*  Global Variables:
      INCLUDE 'ME_COM'           ! Common blocks required by MEMSYS3.
      INCLUDE 'C1_COM'           ! Common blocks use to communicate with
                                 ! MEM2D
      INCLUDE 'CNF_PAR'          ! For CNF_PVAL function

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER  J
      INTEGER  K

*  Call a lower-level routine to do the work.  Find the MEMSYS3 areas
*  either in a dynamically allocated external work array, or in
*  internal memory within common block /MECOMS/.  Area <3> holds the
*  FFT of the PSF.
      IF ( C1_WEXT ) THEN
         CALL KPS1_OP1( %VAL( CNF_PVAL( C1_IP( 3 ) ) ),
     :                  %VAL( CNF_PVAL( C1_IP( J ) ) ),
     :                  %VAL( CNF_PVAL( C1_IP( K ) ) ) )

*  Pad the external area out with zeros.  This puts zeros between the
*  last image pixel and the end of the area (areas can be bigger than
*  images because of the need to have an integer number of buffers in
*  each area).  This simulates a response function of zero at these
*  pixels.
