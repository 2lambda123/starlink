      SUBROUTINE KPS1_ZPDEC( FNAME, FRM, TEXT, POS, NP, REGION, LINE, 
     :                       OBJECT, OK, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_ZPDEC

*  Purpose:
*     Decodes a record from a ZAPLIN steering file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_ZPDEC( FNAME, FRM, TEXT, POS, NP, REGION, LINE, OBJECT, 
*                      OK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine extracts field from a line of text read from a ZAPLIN
*     steering file, classifies the type of region described by the 
*     line, and returns the corresponding axis values in the supplied 
*     Frame.

*  Arguments:
*     FNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the text file from which the supplied text was 
*        read.  Used only in error messages.
*     FRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to the AST Frame to be used to unformat the axis 
*        values.
*     TEXT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The text read from the file.  It should contain no leading 
*        spaces.
*     POS( 2, 2 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        On entry, this array should hold two typical positions on the
*        image.  On exit, it holds the positions read from the text.
*        The first index is position number, and the second index is 
*        axis number.
*     NP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of positions read from the line.  Allowed values
*        are 0, 1 or 2.
*     REGION = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Does the text represent a region?
*     LINE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Does the text represent a set of image lines?
*     OBJECT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        A string describing the type of region to be zapped.
*     OK = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Was this a comment line or blank line?
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - No error is reported if an illegally formatted line is supplied,
*     but NP is returned as 0 (OK is still returned .TRUE.).
