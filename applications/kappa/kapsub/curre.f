      SUBROUTINE CURRE( CURSOR, PNLOW, PNUPP, LBND, UBND, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CURRE

*  Purpose:
*     Defines a region within the current zone

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*      CALL CURRE( CURSOR, PNLOW, PNUPP, LBND, UBND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine defines a 2-d region in the current zone. If a
*     cursor is available and required, then it is used to define the
*     rectangular area, otherwise, the co-ordinates of the region come
*     from the environment.

*  Arguments:
*     CURSOR = LOGICAL ( READ )
*         True if the cursor is required
*     PNLOW = CHARACTER ( READ )
*         Parameter name of lower-bound co-ordinates that defines a
*         region (if %CURSOR is false)
*     PNUPP = CHARACTER ( READ )
*         Parameter name of lower-bound co-ordinates that defines a
*         region (if %CURSOR is false)
*     LBND( 2 ) = REAL( WRITE )
*         Co-ordinates of the lower bound that defines a region (if
*         %CURSOR is false).
*     UBND( 2 ) = REAL( WRITE )
*         Co-ordinates of the upper bound that defines a region (if
*         %CURSOR is false).
*     STATUS  = INTEGER( READ, WRITE )
*         Global status value

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     Get bounds of the zone and the position of its centre
*     If cursor mode then
*        Show functions of the choice device's buttons
*        Repeat until two final positions have been chosen or exit
*          button has been depressed or there is an error
*           Repeat until the first position has been chosen or there
*             is an error
*              Obtain a valid cursor position, i.e. within current zone
*              Reset last cursor position to its current position
*              If exit button has been pressed set repeat switch to off
*              Else if first button has been pressed then
*                 Describe the next functions of the choice device and
*                   locator
*                 Mark the chosen point with a cross
*                 Switch off first-point repeat
*              Else
*                 Describe next functions of the choice device and 
*                   locator
*              Endif
*           End repeat
*           Repeat until the second position has been chosen or there
*             is an error
*              Obtain a valid cursor position, i.e. within current zone
*              Reset last cursor position to its current position
*              If exit button has been pressed set repeat switch to
*                off and clear the crosses and box
*              Else if first button has been pressed then
*                 If the second position is different from the
*                   first then
*                    Erase previous cross
*                    Report the co-ordinates of the region
*                    Switch off second-point and main repeat switches
*                 Else
*                    Report the error and try again
*                 Endif
*              Else
*                 Try again
*              Endif
*           End repeat
*        End repeat
*     Else
*        Report bounds of the current zone
*        Obtain the four co-ordinates from the terminal such that
*          the two positions are different
*        If an error other than abort occurs, annul error and set the
*          region to be the full array
*        Tidy parameters
*     Endif
*     End
