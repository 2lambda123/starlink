      SUBROUTINE KPS1_WIECS( NPIX, NLIN, DATA, SIGMA, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_WIECS

*  Purpose:
*     Finds a rough estimates of the noise in an image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_WIECS( NPIX, NLIN, DATA, SIGMA, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A rough estimate of the variance of the noise in the supplied
*     image is formed as half the mean squared difference between
*     adjacent pixels.  The process is repeated, this time excluding
*     pixels which differ by more than 3*sigma from their neighbours.

*  Arguments:
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels per line in the input data.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels per line in the input data.
*     DATA( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input data.
*     SIGMA = REAL (Returned)
*        A rough estimate of the standard deviation of the noise in the
*        data.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
