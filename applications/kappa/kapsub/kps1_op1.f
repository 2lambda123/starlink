*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_OP1

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a simulated data set.

*  Language:

*  Arguments Given:
      REAL     PSF( C1_NPX, C1_NLN )
      REAL     IN( C1_NPX, C1_NLN )

*  Arguments Returned:
      REAL     OUT( C1_NPX, C1_NLN )

*  Local Variables:
      INTEGER STATUS             ! Status value

*.

*  Set status to OK.
      STATUS = SAI__OK  

*  Take the FFT of the input image, storing the result back in the array
*  IN.  The array OUT is used here as work space.
      CALL KPG1_FFTFR( C1_NPX, C1_NLN, IN, OUT, IN, STATUS )

*  Multiply the FFT of the input image by the FFT of the PSF.  Store 
*  the result back in the array IN.
      CALL KPG1_HMLTR( C1_NPX, C1_NLN, IN, PSF, IN, STATUS )

*  Take the inverse FFT of the product to get the simulated data.  IN
*  is used as work space.
      CALL KPG1_FFTBR( C1_NPX, C1_NLN, IN, IN, OUT, STATUS )
