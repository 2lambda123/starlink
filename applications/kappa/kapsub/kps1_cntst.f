      SUBROUTINE KPS1_CNTST( IPLOT, IGRP, IPEN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_CNTST

*  Purpose:
*     Establish a pen style from an attribute list in a group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_CNTST( IPLOT, IGRP, IPEN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine sets the plotting style according to a given element
*     in the supplied group.

*  Arguments:
*     IPLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to the Plot.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for a group containing descriptions of the pens
*        to be used. Each element in the group should be a comma
*        separated list of AST attribute settings to be established.
*        Any attributes not specified default to their values in the Plot.
*     IPEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index withi the group of the style to be established.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Global Constants:

*  Arguments Given:

*  Status:

*  Local Variables:

*  Get the next list of AST Attribute settings from the group.
