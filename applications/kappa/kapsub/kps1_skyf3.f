      SUBROUTINE KPS1_SKYF3( M, N, NPOS, XC, AA, BB, XX, YY, XO, YO,
     :                       FVECC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_SKYF3

*  Purpose:
*     Find the spatial residuals at a set of positions after
*     transformation using a supplied IRA projection.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_SKYF3( M, N, NPOS, XC, AA, BB, XX, YY, XO, YO, FVECC,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied sky co-ordinates are transformed using an IRA
*     projection defined by the argument XC (together with other
*     information passed from KPS1_SKYFT in common block SFT_COM).
*     The resulting image co-ordinates are compared with the supplied
*     image co-ordinates and the residuals in X and Y at each position
*     are returned in FVECC.

*  Arguments:
*     M = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of residuals to be calculated.  M should be two
*        times NPOS.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of projection parameters supplied in XC.  The
*        remaining ones are defined by values stored in common.
*     NPOS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the arrays AA, BB, XX, YY, XO and YO.
*     XC( N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The projection parameters for which the residuals are required.
*        These projection parameters are stored in the same order as the
*        "P" argument for subroutine IRA_CREAT, except that for each
*        projection parameter value which has been fixed by the user,
*        the remaining elements in XC are shuffled down to occupy the
*        location which otherwise would have been used by the fixed
*        projection parameter.  Fixed parameter values are supplied in
*        common.
*     AA( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The sky longitude values.
*     BB( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The sky latitude values.
*     XX( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The image X values.
*     YY( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The image Y values.
*     XO( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The image X values formed by transforming AA and BB.
*     YO( NPOS ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The image Y values formed by transforming AA and BB.
*     FVECC( M ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The residuals.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
