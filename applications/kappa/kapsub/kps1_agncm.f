      SUBROUTINE KPS1_AGNCM( PARAM1, PARAM2, IGRP, NREG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_AGNCM

*  Purpose:
*     Combines existing regions in the supplied group for ARDGEN

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_AGNCM( PARAM1, PARAM2, IGRP, NREG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A logical operator (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) is obtained from the
*     environment using the parameter supplied in PARAM1.  The regions
*     to be combined are then obtained from the environment using
*     parameter PARAM2.  Regions are identified by indices which
*     correspond to the order in which the regions were defined.  The
*     two regions (or one region in the case of the NOT operator) are
*     then located in the supplied GRP group.  The text for the two
*     regions is copied to the end of the group, with the operator text
*     interposed between them.  The elements containing the operator and
*     the second region are indented with spaces so that they are
*     interpreted as being a continuation of the first region, and the
*     whole thing is placed between opening and closing parentheses.
*     The original regions are deleted from the returned group.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM1 = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter to use to get the operator.
*     PARAM2 = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter to use to get the region indices to
*        operate on.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The GRP identifier for the group holding the ARD descriptions.
*     NREG = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of regions in the group.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     9-DEC-1994 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     1995 March 15 (MJC):
*        Brought into line with the KAPPA style (e.g. sorting the
*        variables and not using continuation lines), and shortened long
*        lines.  Fixed a bug that did caused region indices not to be in
*        increasing order.
*     18-SEP-2001 (DSB):
*        Added argument NREG.
