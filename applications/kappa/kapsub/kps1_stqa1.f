      SUBROUTINE KPS1_STQA1( NEL, IN, OUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_STQA1

*  Purpose:
*     Convert an integer ARD mask to a real IRQ mask.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_STQA1( NEL, IN, OUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The input vector is copied to the output vector, with pixel
*     values being transformed as follows: positive values in the input
*     are transformed to bad values in the output, zero values in the
*     input remain zero in the output.

*  Arguments:
*     NEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the input and output vectors.
*     IN( NEL ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The input vector.
*     OUT( NEL ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The output vector.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
