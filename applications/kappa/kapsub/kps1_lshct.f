      SUBROUTINE KPS1_LSHCT( NPOS, IDS, FIRST, LAST, STEP, NDISP, 
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_LSHCT

*  Purpose:
*     Count the number of positions to be displayed by LISTSHOW.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_LSHCT( NPOS, IDS, FIRST, LAST, STEP, NDISP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine counts the number of positions identifiers between the
*     supplied limits.

*  Arguments:
*     NPOS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of supplied position identifiers.
*     IDS = INTEGER( NPOS ) (Given)
*        The supplied position identifiers.
*     FIRST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lowest position identifier to be selected.
*     LAST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The highest position identifier to be selected.
*     STEP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The increment between position identifier to be selected.
*     NDISP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of positions identifiers within IDS which are within
*        the range FIRST to LAST (inclusive).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.
