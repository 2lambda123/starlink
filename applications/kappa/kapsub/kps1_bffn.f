      SUBROUTINE KPS1_BFFN( M, N, XC, FVEC, IFLAG )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_BFFN

*  Purpose:
*     Evaluates function values for minimisation routine PDA_LMDIF1

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_BFFN( M, N, XC, FVEC, IFLAG )

*  Description:
*     This function is related to application BEAMFIT.  It services the
*     calls to PDA_LMDIF1 made in subroutine KPS1_BFFT.  The data
*     needed by this routine is passed from KPS1_BFFT in common blocks
*     defined in include file BF_COM.
*
*     The argument XC (together with values supplied in common) defines
*     a Gaussian fit to imaging data.  The residuals between the
*     resulting fitted image and the original image supplied in common
*     are returned in argument FVEC.
*
*     If an error occurs in this routine, an error is reported and the
*     status value is returned in common variable ISTAT.

*  Arguments:
*     M = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of residuals to be calculated.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of fit parameters which are allowed to vary.
*     XC( N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The parameters of the two-dimensional Gaussian fit for which 
*        the residuals are required.  The full list of elements for each
*        Gaussian is as follows.
*           1  --  X pixel centre
*           2  --  Y pixel centre
*           3  --  Major axis standard deviation in pixels
*           4  --  Minor axis standard deviation in pixels
*           5  --  Position angle of the major axis in radians
*           6  --  Amplitude
*           7  --  Background (assumed to be a constant level)
*
*        Where each fit parameter has been fixed by the user, the 
*        remaining elements in XC are shuffled down to occupy the
*        location which otherwise would have been used by the fixed
*        projection parameter.  Fixed parameter values are supplied in
*        common.
*     FVEC( M ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The residuals.
*     IFLAG = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Success flag.  0 is success.  Negative is failure.
