*  Name:
*     KPS1_LUCDT

*  Purpose:
*     Creates simulated data from the current reconstructed image
*     and return the corresponding normalised chi-squared value.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_LUCDT( N, NPIX, NLIN, XMARG, YMARG, CHIFAC, WLIM,
*                      FILE_3, FILE_4, FILE_6, FILE_1, FILE_8, FILE_7,
*                      FILE_2, FILE_5, XSQ, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Simulated data is formed by convolving the current reconstructed
*     image (in file 1) with the PSF and adding the background data.
*     The simulated data is returned in file 7.  The deviation of the
*     simulated data from the observed data is then estimated in terms
*     of a chi-squared value, based on the variances supplied in file 8
*     and the value of CHIFAC.  Edge pixels are excluded from the
*     estimation of chi-squared.

*  Arguments:
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in each internal file.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels per line in each internal file.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines in each internal file.
*     XMARG = INTEGER (Given)
*        The width of the left- and right-hand margins in pixels.
*     YMARG = INTEGER (Given)
*        The width of the top and bottom margins in pixels.
*     CHIFAC = REAL (Given)
*        The co-efficient of the simulated data in the denominator of
*        the expression used to evaluate the chi-squared of each data
*        value.
*     WLIM = REAL (Given)
*        Weight limit for good pixels.
*     FILE_3( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Given)
*        The Fourier transform of the PSF.
*     FILE_4( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Given)
*        The observed data. 
*     FILE_6( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Given)
*        The background data. 
*     FILE_1( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Given)
*        The current reconstructed image.
*     FILE_8( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Given)
*        The accuracy of each data value. 
*     FILE_7( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Returned holding the simulated data.
*     FILE_2( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.  Returned holding the simulated data minus the
*        background data.
*     FILE_5( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space. 
*     XSQ = REAL( Returned)
*        The normalised chi-squared value describing the deviation of
*        the simulated data returned in file 7, from the observed data
*        in file 4.  N.B., this is the chi-squared per pixel.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
