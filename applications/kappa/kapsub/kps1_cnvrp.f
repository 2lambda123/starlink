*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_CNVRP

*  Purpose:
*     Replicates edge pixels into the margins of an array, for
*     CONVOLVE.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_CNVRP( ILO, IHI, JLO, JHI, NPIX, NLIN, ARRAY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Replicates the edge values in a given subsection of the supplied
*     array out to the edges of the array.

*  Arguments:
*     ILO = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the column which is to be replicated to the left
*        hand edge (i.e. column 1) of the array.
*     IHI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the column which is to be replicated to the right
*        hand edge (i.e. column NPIX) of the array.
*     JLO = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the row which is to be replicated to the bottom
*        edge (i.e. row 1) of the array.
*     JHI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the row which is to be replicated to the top
*        edge (i.e. row NLIN) of the array.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of columns in the array.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines in the array.
*     ARRAY( NPIX, NLIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        The array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
