      SUBROUTINE SHIFTX( XNEG, XWHOLE, INTXS, FRACX, DIM1, DIM2, ARRIN,
     :                   ARROUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SHIFTX

*  Purpose:
*     Input array is shifted into the output array in the X
*     direction

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SHIFTX( XNEG, XWHOLE, INTXS, FRACX, DIM1, DIM2, ARRIN,
*    :             ARROUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The output array, ARROUT, will contain the input array, ARRIN,
*     shifted in the X direction. The following arguments determine
*     how the shift is performed:
*     XNEG   - if .true. then shift is a negative shift
*     XWHOLE - if .true. then shift is through a whole number of pixels
*     INTXS  - integer pixel shift. This will also be the number of
*              columns of the output array which will be set to zeros.
*     FRACX  - fractional pixel shift, only used if XWHOLE is .FALSE.
*     An immediate return will occur if STATUS has an error value on
*     entry.
*
*     Undefined pixels are given the magic value.

*  Arguments:
*     XNEG = LOGICAL( READ )
*           Will be .TRUE. if shift is in the negative direction.
*     XWHOLE = LOGICAL( READ )
*           Will be .TRUE. if shift is a whole number of pixels.
*     INTXS = INTEGER( READ )
*           Number of whole pixels through which the input data will be
*           shifted.
*     FRACX = REAL( READ )
*           Fractional part of the pixel shift, will only be needed if
*           XWHOLE is set to .FALSE.
*     DIM1 = INTEGER( READ )
*         The first dimension of the 2-d arrays.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER( READ )
*         The second dimension of the 2-d arrays.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER( READ )
*           Dimensions of the input and output arrays.
*     ARRIN( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL( READ )
*           Data to be shifted.
*     ARROUT( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL( WRITE )
*           Will contain the shifted data.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ )
*           This is the global status, if this variable has an error
*           value on entry then an immediate return will occur.

*  Algorithm:
*     If no error on entry then
*        Set all elements of output array equal to bad value
*        If shift is through whole number of pixels then
*           If negative shift then
*              For all lines of output image
*                 For all pixels in line up to pixel corresponding to
*                   last
*                   pixel in input image line
*                    Output image pixel is shifted input image pixel
*                 Endfor
*              Endfor
*           Else
*              For all lines of output image
*                 For all pixels in line from pixel corresponding to
*                   first
*                   pixel in input image line
*                    Output image pixel is shifted input image pixel
*                 Endfor
*              Endfor
*           Endif
*        Else shift is fractional pixel shift
*           Calculate second interpolation weight as 1.0 - FRACX
*           If negative shift then
*              For all lines of output image
*                 For all pixels in line up to pixel corresponding to
*                   last pixel in input image line
*                    Set up interpolation limits
*                    If either input pixel is invalid then
*                       Output image pixel is invalid
*                    Else
*                       Output image pixel is interpolated from input
*                         image pixels
*                    Endif
*                 Endfor
*              Endfor
*           Else
*              For all lines of output image
*                 For all pixels in line from pixel corresponding to
*                   first pixel in input image line
*                    Set up interpolation limits
*                    If either input pixel is invalid then
*                       Output image pixel is invalid
*                    Else
*                       Output image pixel is interpolated from input
*                         image pixels
*                    Endif
