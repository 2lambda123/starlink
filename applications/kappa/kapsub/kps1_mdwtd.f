*  Name:
*     KPS1_MDWTx

*  Purpose:
*     Performs 2-dimensional weighted median filtering of an array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      CALL KPS1_MDWTx( DIFF, STEP, DAMP, NUMSAM, MEDPOS, MEDTHR,
*                       SAMSIZ, SAMINF, IDIM1, IDIM2, ARRIN, ODIM1,
*                       ODIM2, SAMPLE, SAMWT, ARROUT, CHANGE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The input array, ARRIN, is filtered using a weighted median
*     filter to give the output array, ARROUT.  An input image point
*     will only be replaced by the sample median if:
*       a) the absolute value of the difference between the input image
*          point and the sample median is greater than DIFF;
*       b) at least three valid pixels were used to define it;
*       c) and at least MEDTHR*MEDPOS weighting was used to define it.
*
*     The extent of the filter is defined by STEP and the weighting
*     values and offsets for the elements of the filter are given in
*     SAMINF.  A damping algorithm may be switched on by calling the
*     routine with DAMP=.TRUE.  In this case values are not replaced by
*     the median value but by a value mid way between it and the median
*     value.  This may be used to prevent the output oscillating
*     endlessly between two solutions if the filter is being used
*     iteratively.

*  Arguments:
*     DIFF = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Determines whether replacement by the median will take place.
*        Replacement will only take place if the absolute value of the
*        input array point minus the median value of the weighted
*        sample is greater than DIFF.
*     STEP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Gives the separation in pixels between the filter elements.
*     DAMP = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Flag which may be set .TRUE. to switch on a damping algorithm,
*        in which the data value is replaced not by the median value but
*        by a value midway between it and the median value.  This is
*        used to prevent the output oscillating endlessly between two
*        solutions if the filter is being used iteratively.
*     NUMSAM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in the sample with non-zero weights.
*     MEDPOS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The position of the median in the sorted sample if no invalid
*        pixels are present.
*     MEDTHR = REAL (Given)
*        Minimum median position as a fraction of MEDPOS, after the
*        removal of any invalid pixels.
*     SAMSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimension of the SAMINF, SAMPLE, and SAMWT arrays.
*     SAMINF( SAMSIZ, 3 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The x-y offsets and weights for the elements of the filter.
*     IDIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the input 2-dimensional array.
*     IDIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the input 2-dimensional array.
*     ARRIN( IDIM1, IDIM2 ) = ? (Given)
*        Data array to be filtered.
*     ODIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the output 2-dimensional array.
*     ODIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the output 2-dimensional array.
*     SAMPLE( SAMSIZ ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Used to store the data to be sorted.
*     SAMWT( SAMSIZ ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Used to store the weights corresponding to the data being
*        sorted.
*     ARROUT( ODIM1, ODIM2 ) =  ? (Returned)
*        The array of filtered data.
*     CHANGE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        A flag which is returned .TRUE. when the data has been changed
*        by the filtering.  If CHANGE is returned .FALSE., then the
*        filtering has converged and the caller can stop iterating.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     If no error on entry then
*        initialise CHANGE to FALSE
*        For all lines of output image
*           Calculate position of corresponding input image line
*           For all points in output image line
*              Calculate position of corresponding input image point
*              Initialise running totals of weight and number in sample
*              For number of points in sample
*                 Calculate position of point for inclusion in sample
*                 If pixel is valid then
*                    Add to running total of actual number of values in
*                      sample to be sorted
*                    Store value of point in sample array
*                    Store weight of point in SAMWT array
*                    Increment running total of weight
*                 Endif
*              Endfor
*              Compute position of median in sorted sample using summed
*                weight
*              If insufficient valid pixels have been used to form the
*                sample or median is too small then
*                Set output pixel to be input pixel value
*              Else
*                 Sort sample array until median is found
*                 If difference between input image point and median is
*                  greater than specified diffrence then
*                    set CHANGE to TRUE
*                    If damping is required then
*                      Output image point becomes mid way between the
*                       old value and the median
*                    Else
*                      Output image point becomes median
*                    Endif
*                 Else
*                   Output image point becomes input image point
*                 Endif
*              Endif
*           Endfor
*        Endfor
*     Endif

*  History:
*     24/10/1983 (DB):
*        Original version.
*     17/02/1984 (DB):
*        Documentation brought up to standard.
*     1986 September 11 (MJC):
*        Renamed parameters section to arguments, added invalid-pixel
*        handling, which necessitated an additional argument (MEDTHR -
*        5th), reordered ARROUT (old 10th to new 13th) in arguments and
*        tidied.
*     1989 August 7 (MJC):
*        Passed array dimensions as separate variables.
*     1993 July 20 (SMB):
*        DAMP and CHANGE arguments added and damping algorithm
*        incorporated.  Also bug fixed: ARRIN(X,Y) set to
*        ARROUT(OFSETX,OFSETY) if there are insufficient points to make
*        a median, rather than ARROUT(X,Y).
*     1995 July 27 (MJC):
*        Made generic (from MEDWTS).  Used a modern prologue and style.
