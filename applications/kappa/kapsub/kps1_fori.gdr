      SUBROUTINE KPS1_FORI<T>( M, N, A, B, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_FORIx

*  Purpose:
*     Converts data held in modulus and phase form to complex form
*     (separate real and imaginary parts).

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_FORIx( M, N, A, B, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Converts a two-dimensional array held in modulus and phase form to
*     complex form (separate real and imaginary parts).

*  Arguments:
*     M = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels per line of the FFT.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lines in the FFT.
*     A( M, N ) = ? (Given and Returned)
*        On input it is `power' = modulus of complex value.
*        On output it is the real part of the FFT.
*     B( M, N ) = ? (Given and Returned)
*        On input it is `phase' = arctan(imag/real) in radians.
*        On output it is the imaginary part of the FFT.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for real and double-precision floating-
*     point data: replace "x" in the routine name by D or R as
*     appropriate.  The arrays supplied to the routine must have the
*     data type specified.

*  Algorithm:
*     - The input complex data is overwritten by the power and phase
*       data.  `Power' is here used to refer to the modulus of the
*       complex value, and phase is arctan(imaginary/real) in
*       radians.

*  History:
*     1988 Jun 6 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     1990 Mar 19 (MJC):
*        Converted to KAPPA style and reordered the arguments.
*     9-JAN-1995 (DSB):
*        Converted to double precision. Re-format comments in
*        edstar-style.
*     1995 March 29 (MJC):
*        Used the modern style of variable declaration, and minor
*        stylistic changes.
*     1995 March 30 (MJC):
*        Made generic from REALIM.
