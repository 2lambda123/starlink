*  Name:
*     KPS1_ELPR2

*  Purpose:
*     Creates an ARD description for a set of elliptical sectors.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_ELPR2( NX, NY, USEANN, PA, RATIO, RMIN, RMAX, XC, YC, 
*                      NSTEP, PA1, WID, PASTEP, REGVAL, IGRP, REGIND, 
*                      REGCEN, REGWID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An identifier for a GRP group is returned which holds an ARD
*     description defining a set of wedge-shaped sectors described by
*     the supplied arguments.  The azimuthal angle at the centre, and
*     opening angle of each bin are also returned, together with the
*     bin number corresponding to each mask value (i.e. the integer
*     values in the mask which will be created by ARD_WORK).

*  Arguments:
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the image to which the ARD description
*        applies.
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the image to which the ARD description
*        applies.
*     USEANN = LOGICAL (Given)
*        It is .TRUE. if the sectors are to be restricted to the
*        intersection with the annulus defined by PA, RATIO, RMIN and
*        RMAX.  Otherwise, the ARD description describes the entirity
*        of each sector.
*     PA = REAL (Given)
*        The angle between the major axis of the ellipses and the first
*        axis, given in radians measured anti-clockwise.  It is only
*        used if USEANN is .TRUE.
*     RATIO = REAL (Given)
*        The ratio of the minor- to major-axis lengths.  In the range
*        zero to one.  It is only used if USEANN is .TRUE.
*     RMIN = REAL (Given)
*        The radius (measured on the major axis) of the inner edge of
*        the annulus.  It is only used if USEANN is .TRUE.
*     RMAX = REAL (Given)
*        The radius (measured on the major axis) of the outer edge of
*        the annulus.  It is only used if USEANN is .TRUE.
*     XC = REAL (Given)
*        The x pixel co-ordinate of the ellipse centre.
*     YC = REAL (Given)
*        The y pixel co-ordinate of the ellipse centre.
*     NSTEP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of sectors required.
*     PA1 = REAL (Given)
*        The angle between the x axis and the clockwise edge of the
*        first sector.  Given in radians, and measured positive
*        anti-clockwise.
*     WID = REAL (Given)
*        The width (opening angle) of each sector in radians.
*     PASTEP = REAL (Given)
*        The step between centres of adjacent sectors in radians.  This
*        should be no smaller than WID.
*     REGVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value which will be passed to subroutine ARD_WORK as the
*        value to use to represent the first region included in the 
*        ARD description.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP identifier for a group containing the ARD description.
*        This group should be deleted using GRP_DELET when it is no
*        longer needed.
*     REGIND( * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The index within REGCEN at which each regions azimuthal angle
*        is stored.  The supplied array should be at least 3+NSTEP
*        elements long.  This array is indexed using the positive
*        integer values which subroutine ARD_WORK uses to represent
*        each region.
*     REGCEN( NSTEP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The azimuthal angle at the centre of each sector, in degrees.
*     REGWID( NSTEP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The angular width of each sector, in degrees.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
