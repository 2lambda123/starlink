      SUBROUTINE KPS1_BS2PU( LOC, NXKNOT, NYKNOT, XKNOT, YKNOT, SCALE,

*  Name:
*     KPS1_BS2PU

*  Purpose:
*     Writes two-dimensional B-spline information to a POLYNOMIAL
*     structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_BS2PU( LOC, NXKNOT, NYKNOT, XKNOT, YKNOT, SCALE,
*                      NCOEF, COEFF, WORK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine writes information describing a two-dimensional
*     bi-cubic polynomial surface to a standard Starlink POLYNOMIAL
*     structure, as defined in SGP/38, but with a variant 'BSPLINE' not
*     promulgated there.  An empty POLYNOMIAL structure should already
*     have been created.  All floating-point components within the
*     structure are written as DOUBLE PRECISION.
*
*     It is assumed the calling programme has a one-dimensional array of
*     coefficients, where COEFF( ( IX - 1 ) * ( NYKNOT + 4 ) + IY )
*     contains the coefficient at the (IX,IY)th knot number, where
*     NYKNOT + 4 is the total number of Y terms.  Such a
*     one-dimensional array is used by the PDA_SURFIT and PDA_BISPEV
*     routines, and defined in the NAG manual (see Chapter E02 on
*     "Curve and Surface fitting").
*
*     This routine will convert the coefficient array to
*     two-dimensional, flip it around and store it in the POLYNOMIAL
*     structure so that DATA_ARRAY(IX,IY) contains the coefficient for
*     the (IX,IY)th term.
*
*     The routine will also load the knot positions in the vector KNOTS
*     storing the first dimension knots followed by the second
*     dimension, and a data-scaling factor in SCALE, both of which have
*     type _REAL.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given)
*        Locator to existing but empty POLYNOMIAL structure.
*     NXKNOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of interior knots in the x direction.
*     NYKNOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of interior knots in the y direction.
*     XKNOT( NXKNOT + 8 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The x positions of complete set of knots associated with x.
*     YKNOT( NYKNOT + 8 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The y positions of complete set of knots associated with y.
*     SCALE = REAL (Given)
*        The scale factor applied to the data values before calculating
*        the spline.
*     NCOEF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of bi-cubic coefficients.  It must equal
*        (%NXKNOT+4) * (%NYKNOT+4).
*     COEFF( NCOEF ) = REAL (Given)
*        The bi-cubic B-spline coefficients, defined at the knots in the
*        order increasing x knot, then increasing y.  Thus coefficient
*        Cij in the standard convention is %COEFF((i-1)*(%NYKNOT+4)+j).
*     WORK( NXKNOT + 4, NYKNOT + 4 ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work array used to flip the polynomial coefficients.  On exit
*        it will contain the two-dimensional array of coefficients
*        written to the POLYNOMIAL structure.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.

*     -  Uses the magic-value method for bad or undefined pixels.

*        Use a single generic KNOTS vector rather than XKNOTS and
