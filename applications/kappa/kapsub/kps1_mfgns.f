      SUBROUTINE KPS1_MFGNS( PARNAM, AXIS, NDIM, DIMS, 
     :                       NCSECT, SECT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_MFGNS

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains the NDF section to average for automatic range 
*     determination for MFITTREND.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MFGNS( PARNAM, AXIS, NDIM, DIMS, NCSECT, SECT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine serves MFITTREND.  It returns an NDF section 
*     describing the lines that are to be averaged and analysed
*     to specfify regions to exclude from the detrending.  This section
*     is supplied through an ADAM parameter (argument PARNAM) unless the
*     NDF dimensionality is one, whereupon a null section is returned.
*     When a null value is supplied a representative section is created.

*     The supplied section is filtered such that all elements along the
*     detrend axis (argument AXIS) are included, and elements for
*     dimensions higher than exist in the NDF are removed.

*  Arguments:
*     PARNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter to obtain the NDF section string.
*     AXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The axis index of the dimension that is being detrended.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of NDF dimensions.
*     DIMS( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensions of the NDF.
*     NCSECT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of characters in the returned section.
*     SECT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The NDF section.  Allow at least forty characters for this.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The default section is about the NDF centre with extents set to
*     the square root of the number of elements along each axis, with
*     a minimum of ten or the axis dimension.
