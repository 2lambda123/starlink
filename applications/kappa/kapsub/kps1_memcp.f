      SUBROUTINE KPS1_MEMCP( ILEVEL, MODEL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_MEMCP

*  Purpose:
*     Sets up the MEMSYS3 "areas" needed by MEM2D.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MEMCP( ILEVEL, MODEL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The common block /MECOMP/ required by MEMSYS3 is initialised.
*
*     If possible, all areas (i.e. space to hold images or data sets)
*     required by the program are stored internally in the ME_ST array
*     in common block /MECOMS/.  If there is not room in ME_ST to do
*     this, all the areas are stored in a single dynamically allocated
*     work array and room for a single buffer for each area is
*     allocated in ME_ST using the system for overlaying buffers
*     described in the MEMSYS3 manual. (NOTE, the manual says you can
*     overlay the buffers for areas 22 and 27, but you can't).  The
*     address as which each area starts is stored in common block
*     C1_COM.  The indices within the whole array, at which each area
*     starts is stored as the MEMSYS3 `allocation pointers' in
*     /MECOMS/.
*
*     If MODEL=CONSTANT, the model is a constant and therefore area 
*     <20> is not needed.  Otherwise, area <20> is needed.
*
*     It is assumed that the output and input pixel sizes are the same.
*     It is also assumed that the PSF image will be stored in area <3>.
*
*     The image dimensions stored in C1_COM should include a suitable 
*     blank margin to overcome edge effects caused by the convolutions.

*  Arguments:
*     ILEVEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The amount of user information to display.  If ILEVEL is one
*        or more, then the percentage of internal storage used is
*        displayed, together with a warning if external storage is
*        being used.
*     MODEL = CHARACTER (Given)
*        If as constant model value is to be used in MEMSYS3, then MODEL
*        has the value 'CONSTANT'.  If a variable model is to be used,
*        MODEL has the value 'NDF'.  A variable model is stored in
*        area <20>.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     24-SEP-1990 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     25-FEB-1991 (DSB):
*        Argument MODEL added, to provide facility for using
*        non-constant models.
*      4-MAY-1991 (DSB):
*        Name changed from SETCMP to KPS1_SETCP.
*     1991 July 18 (MJC):
*        Name changed from KPS1_SETCP to KPS1_MEMCP.
*     17-MAR-1995 (DSB):
*        Changed to allow images to be stored in an external work array
*        if the internal work array is too small.  Re-formatted to
*        EDSTAR style.
*     1995 April 7 (MJC):
*        Typo's and minor stylistic changes.  Used modern-style variable
*        declarations.
