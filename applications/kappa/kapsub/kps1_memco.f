*  Name:
*     KPS1_MEMCO

*  Purpose:
*     Continues the main MEMSYS3 loop.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MEMCO( PARAM, UPDATE, EXTEND, INDF, RATE, DEF, NITER, 
*                      NOISE, STDEV, ILEVEL, METHOD, ALPHA, BETA, ITER,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The MEMSYS3 routine MEM3 is called iteratively until either the
*     termination criterion is reached, or the maximum number of
*     iterations is reached.  Various diagnostics are displayed
*     depending on the value of ILEVEL.
*
*     The values of the input arguments are used to initialize
*     MEMSYS3 so that the deconvolution continues from where it left
*     off.
*
*     The CLASSIC algorithm is used.  If Gaussian noise is specified
*     by the user then automatic noise scaling is applied.  A uniform
*     model equal to the value of DEF is used.
*
*     A tolerance of 10% and an aim of 1.0 are used in MEM3.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER (Given)
*        The ADAM parameter to use for accessing the output NDF.
*     UPDATE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE. then an output NDF is created afetr each iteration, 
*        otherwise no NDF is created until the routine finishes.
*     EXTEND = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE. then the output NDF is to have analysis information 
*        appended to it in the form of an extension called MEM2D.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier for the input image.
*     RATE = REAL (Given)
*        The dimensionless distance limit between succesive MEMSYS3
*        iterations.  Should be of order 1.0.
*     DEF = REAL (Given)
*        The value of the constant default model to use.  In the absence
*        of data, the reconstruction will tend towards this value.
*     NITER = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of calls to the main MEMSYS3 routine, MEM3,
*        to make.
*     NOISE = CHARACTER (Given)
*        Either GAUSSIAN or POISSON.  Indicates the type of noise
*        statistics to be used in MEMSYS3.
*     STDEV = REAL (Given) 
*        Initial estimate of the mean noise level in the input image.
*     ILEVEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The user information level.  If equal to zero, then no
*        diagnostics are displayed.  As ILEVEL increases up to a
*        maximum of 3, more diagnostics are displayed.
*     METHOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value used for MEM3 argument METHOD during the previous
*        calls to MEM3.
*     ALPHA = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        On entry, the value of MEM3 argument ALPHA, produced by the
*        previous call to MEM3. On exit, the most recent value of
*        ALPHA.
*     BETA = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        On entry, the value of MEM3 argument BETA, produced by the
*        previous call to MEM3. On exit, the most recent value of
*        BETA.
*     ITER = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of MEMSYS3 iterations completed so far.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
