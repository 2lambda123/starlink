      SUBROUTINE KPS1_WIEPW( EL, M, N, FILL, BAD, FILE_6, FILE_2,

*  Name:
*     KPS1_WIEPW

*  Purpose:
*     Replaces an image with its 2-d power spectrum.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_WIEPW( EL, M, N, FILL, BAD, FILE_6, FILE_2, FILE_5,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Any bad pixels in file 6 are first replaced with the supplied
*     fill value.  The Fourier transform of file 6 is then obtained,
*     and multiplied by its own complex conjugate to get the modulus
*     squared of the FT.  This is an approximation to the 2-d power
*     spectrum of the image.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        Total number of elements in each internal file.
*     M = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of columns in the 2-d form of each internal file.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of rows in the 2-d form of each internal file.
*     FILL = REAL (Given)
*        The value to replace bad values within file 6.
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        It is .TRUE. if there are any bad pixels in file 6.
*     FILE_6( EL ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        On input it is the mode image; on return it is the 2-d power
*        spectrum for the model image. 
*     FILE_2( EL ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     FILE_5( EL ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
