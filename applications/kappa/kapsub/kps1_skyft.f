* Name:
*    KPS1_SKYFT

*  Purpose:
*     Find projection parameter values which are consistent with a given
*     set of sky and image co-ordinates.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_SKYFT( LOG, LOGFD, IGRP, NPOS, SCS, EPOCH, PROJ, TILT,
*                      ORIENT, PSIZE, REFIMG, REFSKY, NP, PROJEC, P,
*                      RMS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     An initial guess is made at the projection parameters, and a PDA
*     routine is called to vary the parameter values until the sum of
*     the squared residuals between the supplied image co-ordinates and
*     the transformed sky co-ordinates is minimised.  This process is
*     repeated for each projection supported by IRA, and the projection
*     giving the smallest residuals is returned.  If explicit values
*     have been supplied for any of the projection parameters, they are
*     omitted from the optimisation.

*  Arguments:
*     LOG = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Should the returned parameter values and residuals be logged to
*        a file?
*     LOGFD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FIO file descriptor for the log file.  Ignored if LOG is
*        .FALSE.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        GRP identifier for the group holding the formatted versions of
*        the sky and image co-ordinates on which the projection is to
*        be based.  Each position is defined by 4 adjacent elements in
*        this group; the sky longitude, the sky latitude, the image X
*        and the image Y co-ordinates.
*     NPOS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of positions in the group identified by IGRP.
*     SCS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The sky co-ordinate system in which the longitude and latitude
*        values contained in the group identified by IRGP are given.
*     EPOCH = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The Julian epoch at which the the sky co-ordinates were
*        determined.
*     PROJ = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific projection supplied by the user?
*     TILT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific value supplied by the user for the tilt of the
*        celestial sphere prior to projection?
*     ORIENT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific value supplied by the user for the position
*        angle of the image Y axis?
*     PSIZE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific value supplied by the user for the pixel size?
*     REFIMG = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific value supplied by the user for the image
*        co-ordinates of the reference point.
*     REFSKY = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Was a specific value supplied by the user for the sky
*        co-ordinates of the reference point.
*     NP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of array P.
*     PROJEC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        If PROJ is .TRUE. then this is supplied holding the name of
*        the projection requested by the user.  Otherwise, it's
*        supplied value is ignored and it is returned holding the name
*        of the best projection.
*     P( NP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        The projection parameters.  On entry, the array holds any
*        explicit parameter values requested by the user (as indicated
*        by the arguments TILT, ORIENT, PSIZE, REFIMG and REFSKY).
*        Other elements of the array are ignored.  On exit, such values
*        are unchanged, but the other elements are returned holding the
*        best value of the corresponding projection parameter.
*     RMS = REAL (Returned)
*        The RMS residual in pixels.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
