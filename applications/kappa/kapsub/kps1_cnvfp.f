*  Name:
*     KPS1_CNVFP

*  Purpose:
*     Prepares the given PSF for use in CONVOLVE.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_CNVFP( VAR, NXP, NYP, PSF, NPIX, NLIN, XCEN, YCEN, OUT, 
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A constant background value is subtracted from the supplied PSF.
*     This value is the minimum of the pixel values in the four corners
*     of the supplied PSF.  The PSF is then shifted so that the given
*     PSF centre is located at pixel (1,1), and negative co-ordinate
*     values are wrapped around to the other side of the image.  If the
*     PSF is smaller than the output image size, then it is padded with
*     zeros.  If the PSF is to be used to smooth a VARIANCE array, then
*     the returned PSF values are squared.

*  Arguments:
*     VAR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        .TRUE. if the VARIANCE component is being smoothed.
*     NXP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels per line in the supplied PSF image.
*     NYP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lines in the supplied PSF image.
*     PSF( NXP, NYP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The PSF image.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels per line in the internal images,
*        including a margin to reduce wrap-around effects.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines in the internal images, including a margin
*        to reduce wrap-around effects.
*     XCEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        X pixel index of the centre of the PSF.
*     YCEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Y pixel index of the centre of the PSF.
*     OUT( NPIX, NLIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The prepared PSF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     10-JAN-1995 (DSB):
*        Original version, based on KPS1_MEMFP.
*     1995 March 22 (MJC):
*        Made some stylistic changes, removed long lines and used
*        modern-style variable declarations.
*     1995 April 4 (DSB):
*        Modified to normalise the total data sum in the PSF to 1.
