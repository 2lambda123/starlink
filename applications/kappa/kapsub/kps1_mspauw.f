*  Name:
*     KPS1_MSPAx

*  Purpose:
*     Evaluates a bivariate Chebyshev polynomial series for all elements
*     of a 2-dimensional data array, using x and y axis co-ordinates.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      CALL KPS1_MSPAx( DIM1, DIM2, XAXIS, XMIN, XMAX, YAXIS, YMIN,
*                       YMAX, NXPAR, NYPAR, MCHOEF, CHCOEF, WORK,
*                       OUTARR, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     DIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the data array.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the data array.
*     XAXIS( DIM1 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        X axis array, giving the x co-ordinate of the centre of each
*        column in the array.  Any columns in the array which are
*        outside the x-axis range XMIN to XMAX will be returned as
*        bad values.
*     XMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Lower end of the x range of the fit.
*     XMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Upper end of the x range of the fit.
*     YAXIS( DIM1 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Y axis array, giving the y co-ordinate of the centre of each
*        column in the array.  Any rows in the array which are outside
*        the y-axis range YMIN to YMAX will be returned as bad values.
*     YMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Lower end of the y range of the fit.
*     YMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Lower end of the y range of the fit.
*     NXPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of parameters of the FIT in the x direction, i.e.
*        the degree of the polynomial plus one.
*     NYPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of parameters of the FIT in the y direction, i.e.
*        the degree of the polynomial plus one.
*     MCHOEF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimension of the array of Chebyshev coefficients.
*     CHCOEF( MCHOEF ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The Chebyshev polynomial coefficients, in the order increasing
*        x power for each increasing y power.  Thus coefficient Aij in
*        the standard convention is %CHCOEF(i*(%NYPAR)+j+1).  The array
*        may be rectangular, i.e. the highest x and y orders do not
*        have to be the same.
*     WORK( DIM1 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace for intermediate results.
*     OUTARR( DIM1, DIM2 ) = ? (Returned)
*        The fitted array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Scan through the bins a line at a time.
*     -  If the Y co-ordinate is within the valid range then
*           Evaluate the Chebyshev surface for the line of pixels.
*        else
*           Fill the line with bad values
*        end if

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric data type: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as appropriate.  The
*     OUTARR argument supplied to the routine must have the data type
*     specified.
*     -  Uses the magic-value method for bad or undefined pixels.

*  History:
*     1990 Jan 30 (MJC):
*        Original version as PLY2EV.
*     1993 May 10 (SMB):
*        Converted to PLY2EA to allow the x-y co-ordinates of each
*        pixel to be different from its column and row number.  The
*        calculation of the RMS has been removed, because this routine
*        does not have an input array to compare.
*     1993 May 11 (SMB):
*        Fill any elements whose x or y co-ordinates are outside the
*        range where the polynomial is valid with bad values.
*     1995 August 3 (MJC):
*        Made generic.  Renamed from PLY2EA.  Used a modern-style
*        prologue and coding.
*     1996 October 8 (MJC):
*        Replaced NAG call.  Although this could have been made truly
*        generic and losing the WORK array, it would have generated
*        major changes to the calling application code and other
*        subroutines it calls.
*     1997 May 10 (MJC):
*        Renamed from KPS1_FSPAx.  Reordered code to improve efficiency.
