*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_LUCOU

*  Purpose:
*     Copies the final Lucy-restored image from the internal file <1>
*     to an image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_LUCOU( NPIX, NLIN, FILE_1, XMARG, YMARG, NP, NL, OUT, 
*                      BAD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The area of file 1 corresponding to the output image (i.e.
*     excluding the margins) is copied to the output, and a flag is
*     returned indicating if any bad values were found.

*  Arguments:
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels per line in each internal file.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines in each internal file.
*     FILE_1( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Given)
*        Internal file <1> holding the reconstructed image.
*     XMARG = INTEGER (Given)
*        The width of the left-hand x margin, in pixels.
*     YMARG = INTEGER (Given)
*        The width of the bottom y margin, in pixels.
*     NP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels per line in the output image.
*     NL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines in the output image.
*     OUT( NP, NL ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The output image.
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        It is .TRUE. if any bad values were stored in the output.  It
*        is .FALSE. otherwise.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
