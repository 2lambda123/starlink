*  Name:
*     KPS1_BAFIx

*  Purpose:
*     Fills bad-pixel regions in a 2-dimensional image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_BAFIx( NPIX, NLINES, INARR, VAR, INVAR, NITER, SIZE,
*                      CNGMAX, CNGRMS, NBAD, OUTARR, OUTVAR, DSUM,
*                      WTSUM, DLAST, WTLAST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine replaces all the bad pixels in an image with a
*     solution of Laplace's equation that matches the valid data in
*     the image at the edges of the invalid regions.  This solution
*     has zero gradient normal to any image edges which it meets.

*  Arguments:
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels per line in the input data and variance
*        arrays.
*     NLINES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines in the input data and variance arrays.
*     INARR( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        The input data array.
*     VAR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether or not associated variance information is to be
*        processed and included in the weighting.
*     INVAR( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        The input variance array.
*     NITER = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of iterations required.
*     SIZE = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        On entry it is the initial smoothing size in pixels.  On return
*        it is the final smoothing size.
*     CNGMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The maximum absolute change in output values which occurred in
*        the final iteration.
*     CNGRMS = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The RMS change in output values which occurred in the last
*        iteration.
*     NBAD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of invalid pixels replaced.
*     OUTARR( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Returned)
*        The output data array free of bad values.
*     OUTVAR( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Returned)
*        The output variance array free of bad values.
*     DSUM( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        Work array to sum the values.
*     WTSUM( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        Work array to store the weights.
*     DLAST( NPIX ) = ? (Given)
*        Work array for the last summed values.
*     WTLAST( NPIX, NLINES ) = ? (Given)
*        Work array for the last set of weights.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     Iterate, replacing each bad pixel with a weighted mean of its
*     valid neighbours in the same row and column.  The weights
*     decrease exponentially with a scale length SIZE and go to zero
*     after the first valid pixel is encountered.  When there is
*     variance information this is included in the weighting.  The
*     length SIZE is reduced by a factor 2 whenever the maximum absolute
*     change in an iteration is at least a factor 4 less than the
*     maximum absolute change obtained since the current scale length
*     was first used.  Iterations stop after NITER have been performed.
*
*     When there is variance processing the output variance is
*     reassigned if either the input variance or data value was bad.
*     Where the input value is good but its associated variance is bad,
*     the calculation proceeds as if the data value were bad, except
*     that only the variance is substituted in the output.  The new
*     variance is the inverse of the sum of the weights.
*
*     See the Notes in FILLBAD for additional details and background to
*     the algorithm.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric data type: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as appropriate.  The
*     data and variance arrays supplied to this routine must have the
*     data type specified.
*     -  The state of the replacements (iteration, smoothing length,
*     maximum change, rms change) is tabulated for verbose reporting.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The input variance array should be propagated from the input
*     dataset.  This was done to reduce memory requirements, which are
*     already large.
