*  Name:
*     KPS1_LUCIM

*  Purpose:
*     Creates the next estimate of the Richardson-Lucy reconstructed
*     image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_LUCIM( N, NPIX, NLIN, WLIM, SNYDER, FILE_3, FILE_4,
*                      FILE_8, FILE_1, FILE_7, FILE_2, FILE_5, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The current reconstruction image supplied in file <1> is updated
*     by a single iteration of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, using the
*     simulated data supplied in file 7.  This involves forming the
*     correction factor for each data value (the ratio of observed to
*     simulated data value - but see argument SNYDER), then mapping
*     these correction factors into an image using the transposed PSF
*     to get the mean correction factor at each image pixel.  The
*     current reconstruction image is then multiplied by this image of
*     correction factors.

*  Arguments:
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in each internal file.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels per line in each internal file.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines in each internal file.
*     WLIM = REAL (Given)
*        The weight limit for good pixels.
*     SNYDER = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE. of the Snyder modification to the basic R-L
*        algorithm is to be used.  This causes the correction factor
*        for each data value to be modified by adding the data value
*        variance to both the numerator and the denominator.  This is
*        used in the STSDAS LUCY program.
*     FILE_3( N ) = REAL (Given)
*        The Fourier transform of the PSF (NOT the transposed PSF).
*     FILE_4( N ) = REAL (Given)
*        The observed data.
*     FILE_8( N ) = REAL (Given)
*        The data variances.
*     FILE_1( N ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The current reconstructed image.
*     FILE_7( N ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Supplied holding simulated data created from the supplied
*        image in file 1.  Returned holding internal workings.
*     FILE_2( N ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     FILE_5( N ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Work space.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
