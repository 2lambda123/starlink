      SUBROUTINE FTSIZE( INSIZ, OUTSIZ, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTSIZE

*  Purpose:
*     Calculates a dimension of the Fourier transform.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTSIZE( INSIZ, OUTSIZ, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Calculates the size of an array dimension which can be used by
*     the Fourier-transform routines. If the input value is acceptable
*     then it is returned as the output value. Otherwise the next
*     largest acceptable size is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     INSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        The input axis size, i.e. the dimension of the input array
*        to be transformed elsewhere.
*     OUTSIZ = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The output axis size.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     - The current FFT routines accept any image size, so just return the 
*       supplied image size.
