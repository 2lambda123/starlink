*+
*  Name:
*     IMLST

*  Purpose:
*     Produces a listing of an image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IMLST( INARR, LBND, DIM1, DIM2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, FNAME,
*    :            FACTOR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine generates a formatted listing of a 1-D or a 2-D
*     image. The resulting file may be typed or printed in the usual
*     manner.

*  Arguments:
*     INARR( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL( READ )
*           This array contains the image to be listed.
*     LBND( 2 ) = INTEGER ( READ )
*         Lower bounds of the array, thus the first element of the
*         array (1,1) is actually at (LBND(1),LBND(2)).
*     DIM1 = INTEGER( READ )
*           The first dimension of the 2-d array.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER( READ )
*           The second dimension of the 2-d array.
*     X1 = INTEGER( READ )
*           The lower X bound of the region of the image.
*     Y1 = INTEGER( READ )
*           The lower Y bound of the region of the image.
*     X2 = INTEGER( READ )
*           The upper X bound of the region of the image.
*     Y2 = INTEGER( READ )
*           The upper Y bound of the region of the image.
*     FNAME = CHAR*(*)( READ )
*           The name of the parameter for the file that is to hold the
*           listing.
*     FACTOR = REAL( READ )
*           The factor by which the pixel values are to be multiplied.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ, WRITE )
*           Value of the status on entering this subroutine.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     A new file is created with the supplied filename. The image is
*     divided into vertical strips of 15 pixels wide, so that the first
*     strip runs from pixel 1 to 15. Each horizontal line of data within
*     the range of the strip is taken and put into a buffer called LINE
*     and written to the file. If a FACTOR is specified, then the data
*     are multiplied by that figure before writing it to file.

*  History:
*     7 January 1982
*     26 September 1983
*     1986 Sep 22 : Renamed from KFH_NLIST. Standardised to RAPI2D
*                   style; renamed parameters section to arguments,
*                   added access and deficiencies; added global status
*                   and Fortran open status; added bad-pixel handling;
*                   region limits now unaltered within routine;
*                   removed tabs; relocated 'local' variables to import
*                   etc.; stripped of trailing blanks and tidied
*                   (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1988 Jun 22 : Added identification to error reporting
*                   (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1988 Jun 29 : Converted to FIO, added further error reporting and
*                   made FNAME the parameter name for the file rather
*                   than the file name itself (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1989 May 24 : Fixed bug writing blank record after header;
*                   improved the formatting both across the page by
*                   having half as many numbers (but floating-point
*                   instead of integers), and down the page by noting
*                   the number of strips that fit onto a page
*                   (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1989 Jul 27 : Used packaged FIO_ASSOC to open the x,y file, and
*                   passed the array dimensions as two variables
*                   (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1989 Sep 18 : Changed co-ordinate annotations to start from 1
*                   instead of 0 (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1990 Feb 20 : AIF_OPFIO renamed AIF_ASFIO (RAL::CUR).
*     1991 Jun 10 : Added LBND argument as temporary patch for INSPECT
*                   to use NDF (RAL::CUR).
*     1993 Feb 9  : Used the improved FIO_ASSOC and the new FIO_ANNUL.
*                   (RAL::CUR).
