     :                  STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     INPOL

*  Purpose:
*     Interpolates X, Y pairs of points.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*     CALL INPOL( LINDAT, MAXPTS, NPTS, DATA, DIM1, DIM2, LINE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine interpolates the X, Y pairs of points generated
*     by the LINSET subroutine. Each point is interpolated
*     and stored in an array which can then be used for plotting.

*  Arguments:
*     LINDAT( MAXPTS, 2 ) = REAL( READ )
*         This array contains the X, Y pairs of points to
*           be interpolated.
*     MAXPTS = INTEGER( READ )
*         Maximum number of points and dimension of LINDAT and LINE.
*     NPTS = INTEGER( READ )
*         The number of X, Y points to be interpolated.
*     DATA( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL( READ )
*         The array containing the image data.
*     DIM1 = INTEGER( READ )
*         The first dimension of the 2-d array.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER( READ )
*         The second dimension of the 2-d array.
*     LINE( MAXPTS ) = REAL( WRITE )
*         The array which will contain the interpolated values
*           ready for plotting.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ, WRITE )
*         Status value on entering this subroutine.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     For each point to be interpolated
*        The four surrounding points in the data or image array are
*        obtained. Find the nearest pixel to the point. If the nearest
*        pixel or all the surrounding pixels are invalid, then set the
*        output slice value to be invalid as well. Otherwise the
*        fractiona-pixel displacements of the interpolation point are
*        also calculated. For each valid surrounding pixel the sum of
*        the weighted pixel values and the sum of weights are
*        incremented. The weights are for a bi-linear interpolation. The
*        output value is the weighted mean.
*     Endfor
*     If the slice includes invalid pixels then replace them by the
*     minimum and valid value in the slice, to form an array which can
*     then be used for plotting.

*  History:
*     23 February 1981
*     26 September 1983
*     1986 Sep 22: Renamed from KFH_INTERPOLATE. Standardised to RAPI2D
*                  style; renamed parameters section to arguments and
*                  added access; removed trailing blanks; relocated
*                  'local' variables to import etc.; added status etc.
*                  and error message when there are too many points;
*                  added bad-pixel handling; added an extra argument
*                  viz. MAXPTS to make routine more general; made
*                  arrays run from 1 not element 0 and tidied
*                  (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1988 Jun 22: Added identification to error reporting and removed
*                  NINT in calculation of LINE (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1989 Aug  7: Passed array dimensions as separate variables
*                  (RL.STAR::CUR).
