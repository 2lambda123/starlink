*  Name:
*     MEDWV

*  Purpose:
*     Performs weighted median filtering on a vector

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*      CALL MEDWV( DIM, ARRAY, NELM, MEDTHR, SAMSIZ, SAMINF,
*     :            SAMPLE, SAMWT, MEDIAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The weighted median value of the input array is obtained. The
*     median returned will be undefined if:
*       a) less than three valid pixels were used to define it;
*       b) or the weighting used to define it was less than the
*          specified threshold times the unweighted median position
*          (excluding any invalid pixels).
*
*     The weighted array is only partially sorted via Quicksort for
*     efficiency.

*  Arguments:
*     DIM = INTEGER( READ )
*         Dimension of input data array.
*     ARRAY( DIM ) = REAL( READ )
*         Data to be filtered.
*     NELM = INTEGER( READ )
*         Number of values in the array to be used to compute median
*     MEDTHR = REAL ( READ )
*         Minimum median position as a fraction of MEDPOS, after the
*           removal of invalid pixels.
*     SAMSIZ = INTEGER( READ )
*         Dimension of the SAMINF, SAMPLE and SAMWT arrays.
*     SAMINF( SAMSIZ ) = INTEGER( READ )
*         Weights for the elements of the vector.
*     SAMPLE( SAMSIZ ) = REAL( UPDATE )
*         Used to store the data to be sorted.
*     SAMWT( SAMSIZ ) = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*         Used to store the weights corresponding to the data being
*           sorted.
*     MEDIAN = REAL( WRITE )
*         The weighted median of the data array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ )
*         This is the global status, if this variable has an error
*           value on entry then an immediate return will occur.

*  Algorithm:
*     If no error on entry then
*        For all points in input array
*           Initialise running totals of weight and number in sample
*           If pixel is valid then
*              Add to running total of actual number of values in
*                sample to be sorted
*              Store value of point in sample array
*              Store weight of point in SAMWT array
*              Increment running total of weight
*           Endif
*        Endfor
*        Compute position of median in sorted sample using summed weight
*        If insufficient valid pixels have been used to form the
*          sample or median is too small then
*           Set output pixel to be input pixel value
*        Else
*           Sort sample array keeping track of the weights until the
*             median is found (when the accumulated weights includes the
*             median position)
*        Endif
*     Endif
