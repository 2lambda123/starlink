*  Name:
*     KPS1_CLPTM

*  Purpose:
*     Draw the tick marks around a cell of a CLINPLOT plot.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_CLPTM( BLEDGE, OFFX, OFFY, NPOLY, TICKMAP, X, Y, N, 
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine draws the tick marks around a cell in the plot
*     produced by CLINPLOT.

*  Arguments:
*     BLEDGE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        TRUE if the edges of the plotting area are to be left free of
*        tick marks.
*     OFFX = REAL (Given)
*        The offset in X (graphics coords) between the bottom left corner
*        of the cell that was being annotated when TICKMAP was created,
*        and the current cell being annotated.
*     OFFY = REAL (Given)
*        The offset in Y (graphics coords) between the bottom left corner
*        of the cell that was being annotated when TICKMAP was created,
*        and the current cell being annotated.
*     NPOLY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of polylines used to draw the tick marks.
*     TICKMAP = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        On the initial entry, this should be an AST pointer to a KeyMap 
*        holding information about the poly lines used to draw the tick 
*        marks for the first cell. This will have been produced by
*        KPG1_ASPLN. The information in this KeyMap is copied out of the
*        KeyMap and into the "X" and "Y" arrays. On exit, this KeyMap is 
*        annull and a AST__NULL value is returned. 
*     X( * ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Work space used to hold the X coords at each point. If TICKMAP
*        is supplied not equal to AST__NULL, then the contents of TICKMAP 
*        are copied into X and returned.
*     Y( * ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Work space used to hold the Y coords at each point. If TICKMAP
*        is supplied not equal to AST__NULL, then the contents of TICKMAP 
*        are copied into Y and returned.
*     N( * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Work space used to hold the number of points in each polyline. If
*        TICKMAP is supplied not equal to AST__NULL, then the contents of 
*        TICKMAP are copied into Y and returned.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global status value.
