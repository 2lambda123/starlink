      SUBROUTINE KPS1_MDRFD( STEP, IDIM1, IDIM2, ARRIN, ODIM1, ODIM2,
     :                         ARROUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_MDRFx

*  Purpose:
*     Expands a 2-dimensional array by reflection about its edges.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MDRFx( STEP, IDIM1, IDIM2, ARRIN, ODIM1, ODIM2, ARROUT,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The input array, ARRIN, is copied into the central section of the
*     output array, ARROUT.  The edges of ARROUT are then padded by
*     reflection about the edge pixels of ARRIN.  For example, with
*     STEP = 2 one corner of the input and output arrays would appear
*     as follows :
*
*                                              3 2 1 2 3 3 3
*                                              2 2 1 2 2 2 2
*     corner of     1 1 1 1 1   corresponding  1 1 1 1 1 1 1
*     input array : 1 2 2 2 2   corner of      2 2 1 2 2 2 2
*                   1 2 3 3 3   output array : 3 2 1 2 3 3 3
*                   1 2 3 4 4                  3 2 1 2 3 4 4
*                   1 2 3 4 5                  3 2 1 2 3 4 5
*
*     An immediate return will occur if STATUS has an error value on
*     entry.
*
*     Note: If ARROUT is not large enough to receive the array ARRIN,
*     together with its padding, only part of array ARRIN will be
*     copied.

*  Arguments:
*     STEP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines/columns in the output array which will be
*        padded by reflection.
*     IDIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the input 2-dimensional array.
*     IDIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the input 2-dimensional array.
*     ARRIN( IDIM1, IDIM2 ) = ? (Given)
*        Data to be copied into the central section of the output
*        array.
*     ODIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the output 2-dimensional array.
*     ODIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the output 2-dimensional array.
*     ARROUT( ODIM1, ODIM2 ) = ? (Returned)
*        Will contain input data array in central section and will be
*        padded at the edge of the array by a reflection about the
*        edges of the input array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        This is the global status, if this variable has an error value
*        on entry then an immediate return will occur.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric data type: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as appropriate.  The
*     ARRIN and ARROUT arguments to the routine must have the data
*     type specified.

*  Algorithm:
*     If no error then
*        Copy input array into central area of output array
*        For the first STEP lines of the output array
*           Calculate the index to the line in the output array which is
*             the same number of lines away from the line corresponding
*             to the first line of the input array but on the opposite
*             side of it
*           Copy all the points in this line corresponding to an input
*             array line into the current line
*        Endfor
*        For the last STEP lines of the output array
*           Calculate the index to the line in the output array which is
*             the same number of lines away from the line corresponding
*             to the last line of the input array but on the opposite
*             side of it
*           Copy all the points in this line corresponding to an input
*             array line into the current line
*        Endfor
*        For all lines of output array
*           For the first STEP points in the line
*              Copy the value of the point which is equidistant from the
*                point corresponding to the first point of an input
*                array line but on the opposite side of it
*           Endfor
*           For the last STEP points in the line
*              Copy the value of the point which is equidistant from the
*                point corresponding to the last point of an input
*                array line but on the opposite side of it
*           Endfor
*        Endfor
*     Endif

*  History:
*     26/10/83 (DB):
*        Original version.
*     17/02/84 (DB):
*        Documentation brought up to standard.
*     1986 September 9 (MJC):
*        Renamed parameters section to arguments and tidied.
*     1989 August 7 (MJC):
*        Passed array dimensions as separate variables.
*     1993 July 20 (SMB):
*        Modified to define the variables LASTX and LASTY in such a way
*        that the array ARROUT does not have to be exactly the right
*        size.  If it is too large it is only partly filled.  If it is
*        too small only part of the ARRIN array is copied.  This
*        modification was made to allow median filtering to be repeated
*        at different scale lengths while reusing the same work array.
*     1995 July 27 (MJC):
*        Made generic (from MEDREF).  Used a modern prologue and style.
