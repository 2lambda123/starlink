*  Name:
*     KPS1_CNTDR

*  Purpose:
*     Draws contours of a 2-d array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_CNTDR( IPLOT, IGRP, DIM1, DIM2, ARRAY, XLL, YLL, XSIZE, 
*                      YSIZE, NCONT, CONT, STATS, FAST, DONE, CNTUSD, 
*                      CNTLEN, CNTCLS, CNTPEN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine plots a contour map of a two-dimensional sub-array
*     for a set of contour levels.  For each contour level, it searches
*     the array to find a cell of four pixels containing a contour at
*     that level, and then traces the contour until it closes or ends
*     outside the image.

*     A log of contour heights actually plotted is made.  The pens
*     which draw the contours may be cycled modulo 3 for each height
*     used, and so assist in identification.

*     There is an option to compute the number of closed contours, and
*     the total contour length at each level used.

*  Arguments:
*     IPLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST pointer to the Plot through which the graphics will be
*        produced. The Current Frame should describe the GRID coordinates
*        of the array to be contoured.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for a group containing descriptions of the pens
*        to be used to draw each contour. If this is supplied as GRP__NOID
*        then all contours are drawn using the "Curves" attributes (eg
*        Colour(Curves), Width(Curves), etc ) in the supplied Plot. If a
*        group is supplied, then each element in the group should be a
*        comma separated list of AST attribute settings to be established
*        prior to drawing a contour. Element 1 in the group is used for
*        the first contour, element 2 for the second, etc. If the end of
*        the group is reached before all contours have been drawn, then 
*        another pass is made through the group starting at element 1
*        again. Any attributes not specified default to their values in
*        the Plot.
*     DIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the two-dimensional array.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the two-dimensional array.
*     ARRAY( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        Two-dimensional array to be contoured.
*     XLL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The x co-ordinate of the lower left pixel of the selected
*        sub-array.
*     YLL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The y co-ordinate of the lower left pixel of the selected
*        sub-array.
*     XSIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The x size of the sub-array to be contoured.
*     YSIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The y size of the sub-array to be contoured.
*     NCONT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of contour levels.
*     CONT( NCONT ) = REAL (Given)
*        The contour levels.
*     STATS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Are contour statistics required?
*     FAST = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., then contours are drawn using straight lines as the 
*        basic drawing element. Otherwise, the basic drawing element are
*        geodesic curves in the Current coordinate system of the supplied
*        Plot. This is much slower to draw, but may be useful when a
*        severly non-linear or discontinuous mapping exists between grid 
*        coordinates in the array, and graphics coordinates.
*     DONE( XSIZE, YSIZE ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Workspace to store log of pixels which have already been
*        contoured.
*     CNTUSD( NCONT ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If an element is .TRUE., the contour level corresponding to
*        that element has been used.
*     CNTLEN( NCONT ) = REAL (Returned)
*        If STATS is .TRUE., this returns the total length of contours at
*        each level actually used.
*     CNTCLS( NCONT ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        If STATS is .TRUE., this returns the number of closed contours
*        at each level actually used.
*     CNTPEN( NCONT ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The pen index used for each contour.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     Check for error on entry - return if not o.k.
*     The routine makes a separate pass through the image for each
*     contour to be plotted.  The image is divided into "cells" (groups
*     of four adjacent pixels) and each is examined in turn.  Cells
*     contining "bad" pixels are ignored, but for all others the
*     minimum and maximum cell data values are found.  If the contour
*     level currently being plotted lies between these two values, then
*     a contour crosses the cell in question, otherwise the cell is
*     skipped over on this pass.

*     Having identified a cell containing a contour, the contour
*     following algorithm is triggered.  Each cell side (a "side" is
*     one of the lines joining pixel centres) is examined to determine
*     if the contour passes through it and, if so, at what position.
*     If the contour only passes through two cell sides, then the cell
*     is "simple" and is only crossed by a single contour line.  In
*     this case, the contour entry and exit points are put into a list
*     of positions (to be plotted), the cell is flagged as "done" and
*     the algorithm moves on to the cell adjacent to the contour exit
*     position, where the process is repeated - thereby "following" the
*     contour.

*     Contour following continues until the next cell is off the
*     edge of the image, has already been "done" on this pass, contains
*     a "bad" pixel or is "confused" (i.e. is crossed by more than one
*     contour line).  In "confused" cells, all four cell sides are
*     crossed by contours, and the algorithm pairs the points to form
*     two line segents to plot which do not cross and which produce the
*     shortest total length of contour line within the cell.  Contour-
*     following also terminates if the buffer containing the list of
*     points to plot becomes full.

*     When contour following terminates, all pending output is plotted
*     with the appropriate pen (there are two separate lines to plot if
*     the final cell was confused).  The scan through the data (looking
*     for cells which are crossed by the current contour) then resumes
*     at the cell following the one which initiated the last episode of
*     contour-following.  Cells which are already flagged as "done" do
*     not subsequently trigger further contour-following on this pass.

*  Notes:
*     -  Magic-value bad pixels are correctly processed.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     The contours are not smooth and the scanning algorithm can be made
*     many times faster by not examining all pixels at all heights.

*        but following the KAPPA style.
*     1988 August 8 (RFWS):
*        Corrected bug for confused cell, where there are not three
*        pairings of contour crossing points, formerly only two were
*        assumed; added method section.
*     1988 August 22 (MJC):
*        Extra arguments CNTUSD and PENROT added.
*     1989 August 7 (MJC):
*        Passed array dimensions as separate variables.
*     1997 May (MJC):
*        Renamed from CNTDRW.  Used modern style prologue and
*        commenting.  Added THRESH argument (for dashed lines).
*        Increased co-ordinate buffers to 10000 points.  Added
*        statistics via new arguments STATS, CNTLEN, and CNTCLS.
*     17-MAR-1998 (DSB):
*        Modified to use AST for drawing the contours.
*     20-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        Added argument CNTPEN.
