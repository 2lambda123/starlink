      SUBROUTINE KPS1_AGNDL( PARAM, IGRP, NREG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_AGNDL

*  Purpose:
*     Deletes regions in the supplied group for ARDGEN.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_AGNDL( PARAM, IGRP, NREG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A set of strings is obtained from the environment using the
*     supplied parameter name.  Each string specifies a range of region
*     "indices" corresponding to the regions which are to be deleted
*     (region indices can be displayed using the ARDGEN "List" option).
*     Ranges are given in low-high format (e.g. "2-5").  If both limits
*     are equal a single value can be given (e.g. "2").  Either limit
*     can be replaced by an asterisk in which case the corresponding
*     absolute limit is substituted (either 1, or the number of
*     currently defined regions).
*
*     The supplied GRP group contains the ARD descriptions for each
*     region.  The first region in the group has `index' 1, and
*     subsequent regions are indexed sequentially.  The `index' of a
*     region should not be confused with the indices used by GRP to
*     refer to individual elements within a group.  Each ARD
*     description may occupy several elements in the group.  The ARD
*     keyword for a region always starts at column 1 of a new element.
*     If there are too many arguments to fit them into the rest of the
*     element, then they continue in the next element.  Such
*     continuation elements are marked by the fact that they start with
*     one or more spaces.
*
*     The regions which are to be deleted are removed from the group by
*     overwriting all the corresponding elements with blank strings.
*     Finally a new group is formed from which all blank elements have
*     been removed, and the identifier for this group is returned (the
*     original group is deleted).
      
*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter to use.
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The GRP identifier for the group holding the ARD descriptions.
*     NREG = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of regions in the group.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
