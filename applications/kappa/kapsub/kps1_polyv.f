      DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION KPS1_POLYV( ORDER, C, X )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPG1_POLYV

*  Purpose:
*     Evaluate a polynomial at a given position.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = KPS1_POLYV( ORDER, C, X )

*  Description:
*     This routine evaluates a polynomial of the given order and
*     coefficients at the selected position.

*  Arguments:
*     ORDER = INTEGER (Given)
*        The order of polynomial.
*     C( ORDER + 1 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The polynomial coefficients.
*     X = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The position at which to evaluate the polynomial.

*  Result:
*     The value of the polynomial.
