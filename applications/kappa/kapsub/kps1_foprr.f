      SUBROUTINE KPS1_FOPRR( NCOLI, NLINI, IN, NCOLO, NLINO, FILL,
     :                        ZERO, OUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_FOPRx

*  Purpose:
*     Prepares a 2-d array for being Fourier transformed.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_FOPRx( NCOLI, NLINI, IN, NCOLO, NLINO, FILL, ZERO, OUT,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The input 2-d array is copied to an output array.  It replaces
*     invalid pixels by a prescribed value in the output.  If the input
*     array is not as big as the output, the output array is padded
*     with pixels with the same defined value.  If the input is larger
*     than the output only the pixels that lie within the output
*     array's bounds are copied.  If no input array is given, then
*     the output array is filled with zeros.

*  Arguments:
*     NCOLI = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of columns per line of the input array.
*     NLINI = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lines in the input array.
*     IN( NCOLI, NLINI ) = ? (Given)
*        The array of data to be prepared.
*     NCOLO = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of columns per line of the output array.
*     NLINO = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lines in the output array.
*     FILL = ? (Given)
*        The value with which to fill data `holes' or bad pixels.
*     ZERO = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., then output image is filled with zeros.
*     OUT( NCOLO, NLINO ) = ? (Returned)
*        The prepared array of data ready to be Fourier transformed.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Algorithm:
*     - If the output is to be filled with zeroes then do so.
*     - Otherwise copy the input array, or a subset thereof, to the
*       output, replacing any bad pixels with the fill value.  Pad the
*       end of each line if necessary, and finally pad any remaining
*       lines in the output.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for real and double-precision floating-
*     point data: replace "x" in the routine name by D or R as
*     appropriate.  The arrays and fill value supplied to the routine
*     must have the data type specified.

*  History:
*     1988 Apr 18 (DSB):
*        Original version called PREPIM.
*     1990 Mar 19 (MJC):
*        Converted to KAPPA style and reordered the arguments.
*     1990 Mar 29 (MJC):
*        Improved the efficiency and allowed for trimming.
*     9-JAN-1995 (DSB):
*        Convert to double precision.  Re-format to edstar-style.
*     1995 March 29 (MJC):
*        Added prologue terminator, and used modern-style variable
*        declarations, and some other minor improvements to the
*        commentary.
*     1995 March 30 (MJC):
*        Made generic from FTPREP.
