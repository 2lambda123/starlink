*  Name:
*     KPS1_FSW

*  Purpose:
*     Writes the SURFACEFIT.FIT NDF extension for storing B-spline fit
*     coefficients.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      CALL KPS1_FSWSE( NDFI, NXKNOT, NYKNOT, XKNOT, YKNOT, NCOEF,
*                       COEFF, SCALE, RSMAX, RMS, COSYS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates a SURFACEFIT extension in a supplied NDF.
*     Within in that in makes a FIT structure of type POLYNOMIAL,
*     variant BSPLINE, for storing the fit coefficients; plus RMS,
*     RESIDMAX, and COSYS objects for the rms difference of the fit,
*     the maximum residual, and the co-ordinate system respectively.

*  Arguments:
*     NDFI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF to contain the SURFACEFIT extension.
*     NXKNOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of interior knots in the x direction.
*     NYKNOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of interior knots in the y direction.
*     XKNOT( NXKNOT+8 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The x positions of complete set of knots associated with x.
*     YKNOT( NYKNOT+8 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The y positions of complete set of knots associated with y.
*     NCOEF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of bi-cubic coefficients.  Must equal (%NXKNOT+4) *
*        (%NYKNOT+4).
*     COEFF( NCOEF ) = REAL (Given)
*        The bi-cubic B-spline coefficients, defined at the knots in the
*        order increasing x knot, then increasing y.  Thus coefficient
*        Cij in the standard convention is %COEFF((i-1)*(%NYKNOT+8)+j).
*     SCALE = REAL (Returned)
*        The scale factor applied to the data values before calculating
*        the spline.
*     RSMAX = REAL (Given)
*        The maximum residual.
*     RMS = REAL (Given)
*        The rms difference between the raw array and the fitted array.
*     COSYS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The co-ordinate system.  Originally 'Data' or 'World', but
*        probably better to supply the AST Domain.  The current AST
*        Frame identifier would be better.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
