      SUBROUTINE KPS1_MEMFP( PSF, WORK, NPIX, NLIN, XCEN, YCEN, OUT,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_MEMFP

*  Purpose:
*     Gets the FFT of the given PSF for maximum-entropy reconstruction.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MEMFP( PSF, WORK, NPIX, NLIN, XCEN, YCEN, OUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The input image is shifted so that the given PSF centre is
*     located at pixel (1,1), and negative co-ordinate values are
*     wrapped around to the other side of the image.  If the PSF is
*     smaller than the output image size, then it is padded with zeros.
*     The PSF is normalized so that the FFT convolution routine will
*     not change the total data sum of the image being convolved with
*     the PSF.  The FFT is taken and is returned in the form of a
*     Hermitian FFT. N.B., it is assumed that there are no
*     invalid pixels in the PSF.

*  Arguments:
*     PSF( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input PSF image.
*     WORK( C1_NPX, C1_NLN ) = REAL (Given)
*        A work array.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels per line in the PSF image.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lines in the PSF image.
*     XCEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        X pixel index of the centre of the PSF.
*     YCEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Y pixel index of the centre of the PSF.
*     OUT( C1_NPX, C1_NLN ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The Hermitian FFT of the PSF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
