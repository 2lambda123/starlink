*  Name:
*     MEDWTS

*  Purpose:
*     Performs 2-D weighted median filtering on a 2-D array

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     SUBROUTINE

*  Invocation:
*      CALL MEDWTS( DIFF, STEP, NUMSAM, MEDPOS, MEDTHR, SAMSIZ, SAMINF,
*     :             IDIM1, IDIM2, ARRIN, ODIM1, ODIM2, SAMPLE, SAMWT,
*     :             ARROUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The input array, ARRIN, is filtered using a weighted median
*     filter to give the output array, ARROUT. An input image point will

*  Arguments:
*     DIFF = REAL( READ )
*         Determines whether replacement by the median will take
*           place. Replacement will only take place if the absolute
*           value of the input array point minus the median value of the
*           weighted sample is greater than DIFF.
*     STEP = INTEGER( READ )
*         Gives the separation in pixels between the filter elements.
*     NUMSAM = INTEGER( READ )
*         The number of elements in the sample with non-zero weights.
*     MEDPOS = INTEGER( READ )
*         The position of the median in the sorted sample if no
*           invalid pixels are present.
*     MEDTHR = REAL ( READ )
*         Minimum median position as a fraction of MEDPOS, after the
*           removal of invalid pixels.
*     SAMSIZ = INTEGER( READ )
*         Dimension of the SAMINF, SAMPLE and SAMWT arrays.
*     SAMINF( SAMSIZ, 3 ) = INTEGER( READ )
*         Contains the x,y offsets and weights for the elements of the
*           filter.
*     IDIM1 = INTEGER( READ )
*         The first dimension of the input 2-d array.
*     IDIM2 = INTEGER( READ )
*         The second dimension of the input 2-d array.
*     ARRIN( IDIM1, IDIM2 ) = REAL( READ )
*         Data to be filtered.
*     ODIM1 = INTEGER( READ )
*         The first dimension of the output 2-d array.
*     ODIM2 = INTEGER( READ )
*         The second dimension of the output 2-d array.
*     SAMPLE( SAMSIZ ) = REAL( UPDATE )
*         Used to store the data to be sorted.
*     SAMWT( SAMSIZ ) = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*         Used to store the weights corresponding to the data being
*           sorted.
*     ARROUT( ODIM1, ODIM2 ) = REAL( WRITE )
*         Will hold the filtered data.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( READ )
*         This is the global status, if this variable has an error
*           value on entry then an immediate return will occur.

*  Algorithm:
*     If no error on entry then
*        For all lines of output image
*           Calculate position of corresponding input image line
*           For all points in output image line
*              Calculate position of corresponding input image point
*              Initialise running totals of weight and number in sample
*              For number of points in sample
*                 Calculate position of point for inclusion in sample
*                 If pixel is valid then
*                    Add to running total of actual number of values in
*                      sample to be sorted
*                    Store value of point in sample array
*                    Store weight of point in SAMWT array
*                    Increment running total of weight
*                 Endif
*              Endfor
*              Compute position of median in sorted sample using summed 
*                weight
*              If insufficient valid pixels have been used to form the
*                sample or median is too small then
*                Set output pixel to be input pixel value
*              Else
*                 Sort sample array until median is found
*                 If difference between input image point and median is
*                  greater than specified diffrence then
*                    Output image point becomes median
*                 Else
*                   Output image point becomes input image point
*                 Endif
*              Endif
*           Endfor
*        Endfor
*     Endif

*  Only Be Replaced By The Sample Median If:
*       a) the absolute value of the difference between the input image
*          point and the sample median is greater than DIFF;
*       b) at least three valid pixels were used to define it;
*       c) and at least MEDTHR*MEDPOS weighting was used to define it.
*     The extent of the filter is defined by STEP and the weighting
*     values and offsets for the elements of the filter are given in
*     SAMINF. An immediate return will occur if STATUS has an error
*     value on entry.
