*  Name:
*     KPS1_VECT

*  Purpose:
*     Draws a vector.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_VECT( INK, X, Y, JUST, VECLEN, VECANG, AHSIZE, X1, X2, 
*                     Y1, Y2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine draws a vector, either with or without an arrowhead
*     at the end.  The vector may be drawn centred on the supplied
*     position, or starting at the supplied position. A supplied bounding
*     box is extended to include the drawn vector.

*  Arguments:
*     INK = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .FALSE., nothing is draw but the bounding box is still
*        returned.
*     X = REAL (Given)
*        The x component of the vectors reference position, in the
*        current PGPLOT window.
*     Y = REAL (Given)
*        The y component of the vectors reference position, in the 
*         current PGPLOT window.
*     JUST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Specifies the disposition of the vector with respect to the
*        reference position given by X and Y.  If it has the value
*        'CENTRE' (case sensitive), then the vector is positioned so
*        that its centre coincides with the position given by X and Y.
*        If it has the value 'START' the vector is positioned so that
*        it starts at the position given by X and Y.  If it has the
*        value 'END' the vector is positioned so that it ends at the
*        position given by X and Y.
*     VECLEN = REAL (Given)
*        The length of the vector in the current PGPLOT window.
*     VECANG = REAL (Given)
*        The angle from the y axis to the vector, in radians.  Positive
*        angles are in the same sense as rotation from the x axis to
*        the y axis.
*     AHSIZE = REAL (Given)
*        The length of each stroke of the arrowhead to be placed at the
*        end of the vector, in the world co-ordinate system of the
*        current PGPLOT window.  No arrowhead is drawn if a zero or negative
*        value is supplied.
*     X1 = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The lowest X value in the bounding box. Modified on exit to include 
*        the drawn vector.
*     X2 = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The highest X value in the bounding box. Modified on exit to include 
*        the drawn vector.
*     Y1 = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The lowest Y value in the bounding box. Modified on exit to include 
*        the drawn vector.
*     Y2 = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The highest Y value in the bounding box. Modified on exit to include 
*        the drawn vector.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
