      SUBROUTINE KPS1_ROFWD( X, Y, CANGLE, SANGLE, XP, YP, STATUS )

*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_ROFWD

*  Purpose:
*     Calculates transformed co-ordinates after a rotation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_ROFWD( X, Y, CANGLE, SANGLE, XP, YP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This subroutine takes the input distances X and Y and
*     rotates them through ANGLE degrees clockwise (as given
*     by the sine and cosine SANGLE and CANGLE) to their new
*     values XP and YP using a rotation matrix.

*  Arguments:
*     X  =  REAL (Given)
*        X distance of point from the origin 0.0.
*     Y  =  REAL (Given)
*        Y distance of point from the origin 0.0.
*     CANGLE  =  REAL (Given)
*        Cosine of the rotation angle to be applied.
*     SANGLE  =  REAL (Given)
*        Sine of the rotation angle to be applied.
*     XP  =  REAL (Returned)
*        X distance of point from the origin after rotation.
*     YP  =  REAL (Returned)
*        Y distance of point from the origin after rotation.
*     STATUS  =  INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value

*  Algorithm:
*     Just uses a standard rotation-matrix approach to calculate the
*     transformed distances of a point from the origin 0.0 after an
*     angular rotation of ANGLE degrees clockwise i.e.
*
*               (  cos ANGLE  sin ANGLE  ) ( X )     ( X' )
*               (                        ) (   )  =  (    )
*               ( -sin ANGLE  cos ANGLE  ) ( Y )     ( Y' )

*  History:
*     14-11-1985 (MJM):
*        First implementation for ROTSIZE.
*     1986 September 9 (MJC):
*        Renamed from NEWCOORDS.  Added arguments section to prologue
*        and tidied.
*     1995 May 15 (MJC):
*        Renamed from OCOORDS.  Used SST-style prologue and modern
*        variable declarations.
