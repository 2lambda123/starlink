      SUBROUTINE KPS1_ZPAB<T>( REGION, LINE, COLBND, LINBND, BUFFER,
     :                       LEN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_ZPABx

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a string to be output to a test steering file from
*     ZAPLIN.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_ZPABx( REGION, LINE, COLBND, LINBND, BUFFER, LEN,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine is a server for ZAPLIN.  It reports the pixel indices
*     of the bounds of the region to be be zapped.  It also validates
*     the bounds for a line or column region by checking that they do
*     not include the whole array.
*
*     If a region has been zapped the format of the string is:
*        lower_column lower_line upper_column upper_line
*
*     If a line has been zapped the format of the string is:
*        lower_line upper_line  L
*
*     If a column has been zapped the format of the string is:
*        lower_column upper_column  C

*  Arguments:
*     REGION = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true the string contains lower and upper pixel indices of
*        the region that has been zapped is reported.  If false the
*        line or column pixel-index bounds are written to the string
*        depending on the polarity of LINE.
*        returned.
*     LINE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true a string giving the line bounds in pixel indices is
*        created.  If false the string contains the column bounds.
*        However, it is ignored if REGION is true.
*     COLBND( 2 ) = ? (Given)
*        The column bounds of the region that has been zapped (lower
*        then upper).  These are only used if REGION is true or line is
*        false.  These can be data co-ordinates or pixel indices.
*     LINBND( 2 ) = ? (Given)
*        The line bounds of the region that has been zapped (lower
*        then upper).  These are only used if REGION is true or line is
*        true.  These can be data co-ordinates or pixel indices.
*     BUFFER = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The string containing the bounds of the zapped region.
*     LEN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The length of the string in characters, ignoring trailing
*        blanks.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for real and double-precision data types:
*     replace "x" in the routine name by R or D respectively.  The
*     bounds supplied to the routine must have the data type specified.
