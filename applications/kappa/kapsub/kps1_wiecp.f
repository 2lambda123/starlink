*  Name:
*     KPS1_WIECP

*  Purpose:
*     Copies an input array to a larger output array, and get
*     information about the array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_WIECP( XMARG, YMARG, DIM1, DIM2, IN, NPIX, NLIN, OUT,
*                      MEAN, MEAN2, BAD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The IN array is copied to the OUT array, leaving a margin of
*     XMARG pixels at the left hand edge, and YMARG pixels at the
*     bottom.  The margins are filled with the nearest edge values.
*     The mean data value, the mean squared data value, and a flag
*     indicating if any bad values are present, are returned.

*  Arguments:
*     XMARG = INTEGER (Given)
*        The width of the left-hand x-axis margin, in pixels.
*     YMARG = INTEGER (Given)
*        The width of the bottom y-axis margin, in pixels.
*     DIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels per line in the input data.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels per line in the input data.
*     IN( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The input array.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels per line in the output data.
*     NLIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of pixels per line in the output data.
*     OUT( NPIX, NLIN ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The output array.
*     MEAN = REAL (Returned)
*        The mean value in IN.  Returned equal to VAL__BADR if there
*        is no good data in the array.
*     MEAN2 = REAL (Returned)
*        The mean squared value in IN.  Returned equal to VAL__BADR if
*        there is no good data in the array.
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Returned .TRUE. if any bad values are found in IN.  Returned
*        .FALSE. otherwise.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
