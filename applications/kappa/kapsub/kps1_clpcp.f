*  History:
*     6-JUN-2006 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     2008 November 14 (MJC):
*        No longer return bad values in WORK2 when the ARRAY values lie
*        outside the bounds of the cell.  Clipping to prevent plotting
*        in a vertically adjacent cell is now handled by redefining the 
*        viewport and window bounds for each cell in CLINPLOT itself.
