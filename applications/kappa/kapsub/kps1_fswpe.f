*  Name:
*     KPS1_FSWEX

*  Purpose:
*     Writes the SURFACEFIT.FIT NDF extension for storing fit 
*     coefficients.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      CALL KPS1_FSWPE( NDFI, XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, YMAX, NXPAR, NYPAR, 
*                       MCOEF, CHCOEF, VARIAN, RSMAX, RMS, COSYS, 
*                       STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates a SURFACEFIT extension in a supplied NDF.
*     Within in that in makes a FIT structure of type POLYNOMIAL for 
*     storing the fit coefficients; plus RMS, RESIDMAX, and COSYS
*     objects for the rms difference of the fit, the maximum residual, 
*     and the co-ordinate system respectively.  

*  Arguments:
*     NDFI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF to contain the SURFACEFIT extension.
*     XMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Lower end of the x range of the fit.  It must not be greater
*        than the x position of the first pixel in the data array.
*     YMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Lower end of the y range of the fit.  It must not be greater
*        than the y position of the first pixel in the data array.
*     XMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Upper end of the x range of the fit.  It must not be less
*        than the x position of the last pixel in the data array.
*     YMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Lower end of the y range of the fit.  It must not be less
*        than the y position of the last pixel in the data array.
*     NXPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of parameters of the FIT in the x direction, i.e
*        the degree of the polynomial plus one.
*     NYPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of parameters of the FIT in the y direction, i.e
*        the degree of the polynomial plus one.
*     MCOEF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimension of the array of Chebyshev coefficients.
*     CHCOEF( MCOEF ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The Chebyshev polynomial coefficients, in the order increasing
*        x power for each increasing y power.  Thus coefficient Aij in
*        the standard convention is %CHCOEF(i*(%NYPAR)+j+1).  The array
*        may be rectangular, i.e. the highest x and y orders do not
*        have to be the same.
*     VARIAN( MCOEF ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The variance of the Chebyshev coefficients.
*     RSMAX = REAL (Given)
*        The maximum residual.
*     RMS = REAL (Given)
*        The rms difference between the raw array and the fitted array.
*     COSYS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The co-ordinate system.  Originally 'Data' or 'World', but
*        probably better to supply the AST Domain.  The current AST
*        Frame identifier would be better.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
