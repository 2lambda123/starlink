*  Name:
*     KPS1_ROBLx
 
*  Purpose:
*     Rotates input array into output array for ROTATE.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_ROBLx( NUMRA, LONG, SHORT, ROTSIZ, XLARGE, IDIM1, IDIM2,
*     :                ARRIN, ODIM1, ODIM2, ARROUT, WORK, STATUS )
 
*  Description:
*     This routine rotates an array in 90-degree multiples by blocking
*     (in the NDF sense) the array into square sections.  The input
*     array, ARRIN, is rotated through NUMRA right angles in the
*     clockwise direction as a number of ROTSIZ by ROTSIZ sections.
*     The rotated array is put into ARROUT.
 
*  Arguments:
*     NUMRA = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of right-angles through which the data will be rotated.
*     LONG = INTEGER (Given)
*        Longer dimension of the array to be rotated.
*     SHORT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Shorter dimension of the array to be rotated.
*     ROTSIZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        Size of the subsections to be rotated.
*     XLARGE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Should be .TRUE. if first dimension of the array to be rotated
*        is greater than the second.
*     IDIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the 2-dimensional array to be rotated.
*     IDIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the 2-dimensional array to be rotated.
*     ARRIN( IDIM1, IDIM2 ) = ? (Given)
*        Data to be rotated.
*     ODIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the output 2-dimensional array.
*     ODIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the output 2-dimensional array.
*     ARROUT( ODIM1, ODIM2 ) = ? (Returned)
*        Will contain the rotated data.
*     WORK( ROTSIZ, ROTSIZ ) = ? (Returned)
*        Workspace to hold the subsection for rotation.
*     STATUS = INTEGER( UPDATE )
*        The global status.
*
*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each numeric data type: replace "x" in
*     the routine name by D, R, I, W, UW, B or UB as appropriate.  The
*     ARRIN, ARROUT, and WORK arguments of the routine must have the
*     data type specified.
*     - If an error occurs during the execution of this routine STATUS
*     will be returned containing the appropriate error value.
 
*  Algorithm:
*     If no error on entry then
*        ENDL is the position of the start of the last rotation box
*          along the longer side of the input array
*        ENDS is the position of the start of the last rotation box
*          along the shorter side of the input array
*        INDEXL is a pointer to the position of the start of the
*          rotation box along the longer side of the input array
*        INDEXS is a pointer to the position of the start of the
*          rotation box along the shorter side of the input array
*        ROTSIZ is the size of the rotation box
*        Move along longest side of input array
*        For INDEXL from 1, in steps of ROTSIZ, to a value less than or
*          equal to ENDL
*           Move along shortest side of input array
*           For INDEXS from 1, in steps or ROTSIZ, to a value less than
*             or equal to ENDS
*              Rotate box pointed at by INDEXL, INDEXS
*           End for
*           If shorter dimension of input array is not exactly divisible
*             by ROTSIZ then
*              There will be some data left unrotated so set INDEXS to
*                point at ENDS
*              Rotate box
*           Endif
*        Endfor
*        If the longer dimension of the input array is not exactly
*          divisible by ROTSIZ then
*           There will be some data left unrotated so set INDEXL to
*             point at ENDL
*           Move along shortest side of input array
*           For INDEXS from 1, in steps or ROTSIZ, to a value less than
*             or equal to ENDS
*              Rotate box pointed at by INDEXL, INDEXS
*           End for
*           If shorter dimension of input array is not exactly divisible
*             by ROTSIZ then
*              There will be some data left unrotated so set INDEXS to
*                point at ENDS
*              Rotate box
