      SUBROUTINE KPS1_MLOFL( NSMP, NDISP, OFFSET, DATA, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_MLOFL

*  Purpose:
*     Offset the lines to be drawn in a multi-line plot.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MLOFL( NSMP, NDISP, DATA, OFFSET, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine offsets each row of the array DATA by a specified
*     amount given by array OFFSET. If the offset for a particular row
*     is invalid, the row will not be offset.

*  Arguments:
*     NSMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of samples in each row.
*     NDISP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of rows in the data array.
*     OFFSET( NDISP ) = REAL ( Given )
*        The offset value for each row of the data array.
*     DATA( NSMP, NDISP ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        On entry it contains the data array to be offset.
*        On exit it contains the data array after offsetting
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
