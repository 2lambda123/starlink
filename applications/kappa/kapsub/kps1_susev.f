*  Name:
*     KPS1_SUSEV

*  Purpose:
*     Evaluates a bi-cubic spline for all elements of a 2-d data array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_SUSEV( DIM1, DIM2, INARR, NXKNOT, NYKNOT, XKNOT, YKNOT,
*                      NCOEF, COEFF, SCALE, NPOINT, POINT, WORK, IWORK,
*                      OUTARR, RMS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine fills a 2-d array by evaluating a supplied bi-cubic
*     spline (in its a B-spline representation) at each pixel's
*     position.  The rms difference between the fitted, interpolated
*     pixels and the original pixels is also calculated.

*  Arguments:
*     DIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the data arrays.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the data arrays.
*     INARR( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The original array without fitting.
*     NXKNOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of interior knots in the x direction.
*     NYKNOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of interior knots in the y direction.
*     XKNOT( NXKNOT+8 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The x positions of complete set of knots associated with x.
*     YKNOT( NYKNOT+8 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The y positions of complete set of knots associated with y.
*     NCOEF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of bi-cubic coefficients.  Must equal (%NXKNOT+4) *
*        (%NYKNOT+4).
*     COEFF( NCOEF ) = REAL (Given)
*        The bi-cubic B-spline coefficients, defined at the knots in the
*        order increasing x knot, then increasing y.  Thus coefficient
*        Cij in the standard convention is %COEFF((i-1)*(%NYKNOT+8)+j).
*     SCALE = REAL (Given)
*        The scale factor applied to the data values before calculating
*        the spline. The inverse of this value is used to correctly
*        scale the fitted values. If it is negative there will be no
*        rescaling.
*     NPOINT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The actual dimension of %POINT as declared.  Must be at least
*        4 * ( DIM1 + 1 ).
*     POINT( NPOINT ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Workspace for intermediate results.
*     WORK( DIM1, 2 ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Workspace for intermediate results.
*     IWORK( DIM1 + 1 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     OUTARR( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The fitted array.
*     RMS = REAL (Returned)
*        The rms difference between the raw array and the fitted array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Uses the magic-value method for bad or undefined pixels.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Calculate the number of panels produced by the knots.
*     -  Initialise the rms sums.
*     -  Scan through the bins, calculating the co-ordinates of each
*        pixel, done a line at a time.
*     -  Evaluate the spline surface at the points of the line, scaling
*        the result if requested.
*     -  Form the sums for the rms error of the fit.
*     -  At the end of the loop calculate the rms error.

*     1990 January 30 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1996 October 14 (MJC):
*        Replaced remaining NAG so changed the d.p. types to real, and
*        added IWORK argument.  Renamed from SPL2EV.  Converted to
*        modern style.
