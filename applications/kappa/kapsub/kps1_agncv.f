      SUBROUTINE KPS1_AGNCV( X1, Y1, XW, YW, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_AGNCV

*  Purpose:
*     Displays text telling the user what the latest value is for the
*     cursor position in ARDGEN.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_AGNCV( X1, Y1, XW, YW, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine displays the latest value for the cursor position.
*     When an image is being displayed output is in the form of pixel
*     co-ordinates.

*  Arguments:
*     X1 = REAL (Given)
*        X pixel co-ordinate of the left-hand edge of the image.
*     Y1 = REAL (Given)
*        Y pixel co-ordinate of the bottom edge of the image.
*     XW = REAL (Given)
*        X pixel co-ordinate.
*     YW = REAL (Given)
*        Y pixel co-ordinate.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*        Original version
*     5-DEC-1994 (DSB)
*        Tidied up.  Name changed from ARDG1_CURVD to KPS1_AGNCV.
*        Layout of displayed text modified.
*     1995 March 15 (MJC):
*        Shortened long lines, corrected typo's, and prologue
*        indentation.  Removed the "data" co-ordinates which were
*        `relative' to the picture origin to avoid confusion with
*        genuine data or axis co-ordinates.
