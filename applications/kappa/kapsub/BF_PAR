*  Name:
*     BF_PAR

*  Purpose:
*     Defines BEAMFIT system parameter constants.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  History:
*     2007 March 30 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     2007 May 11 (MJC):
*        Add number of constraints.
*     2010 July 5 (MJC):
*        Increment the number of constraints and fit coefficients.
*     2013 July 15 (MJC):
*        Increment the number of constraints for circularity and
*        orientation.  The latter is not currently set by BEAMFIT
*        except for circularity but might be needed later, so add
*        it while the code structure is fresh in the mind.
