*        total number of spline coefficients.
*     -  Sort the x and y positions.
*     -  Find the maximum and minmum data values.
*     -  Scale the data by the range so that they lie between -1 and +1
*        to improve the performance of the fitting routines.
*     -  Add 2 more bins with zero weight at the bottom-left and
*        top-right corners of the image, to ensure that the spline fit
*        is valid over the whole image area.
*     -  Obtain the spline coefficients of the least-squares fit.
*     -  Should the fit be not unique then warn the user.

*  History:
*     1990 January 31 (MJC):
*        Original version based on some EDRS code.
*     1991 July 5 (MJC):
*        Passed NWS and WS as arguments.  Validates input number of
*        panels in case the maximum number of knots is greater in the
*        calling routine than allowed here, and added commentary on this
*        point.
*     1996 January 31 (MJC):
*        Replaced NAG sorting calls.
*     1996 October 14 (MJC):
*        Replaced remaining NAG so changed the d.p. types to real, and
*        passed different work arrays.  Renamed from SPL2D.
*     1997 July 30 (MJC):
*        Added LWS and NWS arguments.
*     2006 April 12 (MJC):
*        Remove unused variables.
