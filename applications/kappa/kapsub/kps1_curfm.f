*  Name:
*     KPS1_CURFM

*  Purpose:
*     Format a position for CURSOR.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_CURFM( FRM, MAP, XC, YC, NAX, EXTRA, NEWPIC, IAT, LINE, 
*                      ICOL, GOOD, CXY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine formats a position for application CURSOR. The
*     position is supplied in GRAPHICS co-ordinates. It is mapped into the 
*     required Frame before being formatted.

*  Arguments:
*     FRM = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to the Frame to which the position refers.
*     MAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to the Mapping from the supplied graphics position 
*        (XC, YC) to the Frame given by FRM.
*     XC = REAL (Given)
*        The X GRAPHICS co-ordinate.
*     YC = REAL (Given)
*        The Y GRAPHICS co-ordinate.
*     NAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of axes in FRM.
*     EXTRA = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., then axis symbols (and units if NEWPIC is .TRUE.) are 
*        included in the formatted text returned in LINE.
*     NEWPIC = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., then axis units are included in the formatted text 
*        returned in LINE (if EXTRA is .TRUE.).
*     IAT = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of characters in LINE.
*     LINE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The text.
*     ICOL( NAX ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The tab positions for each column of axis values. Initialised if
*        NEWPIC is .TRUE. (should be left unchanged between calls).
*     GOOD = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Were all axis value good in Frame FRM?
*     CXY( NAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The corresponding co-ordinates in FRM.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.
