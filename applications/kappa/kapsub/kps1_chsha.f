      SUBROUTINE KPS1_CHSHA( NTILE, DIMS, ASP, MARGIN, SHAPE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_CHSHA

*  Purpose:
*     Calculates the shape of the grid of channel images.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_CHSHA( NTILE, DIMS, SHAPE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines the arrangement of a supplied number of
*     equally shaped tiles in a two-dimensional grid, such that the grid
*     is as close to a specified aspect ratio as possible.  Both the
*     filling factor of the grid and the area covered are used to select
*     the most-efficient arrnagement.  This routine serves CHANMAP.

*  Arguments:
*     NTILE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of tiles.
*     DIMS( 2 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensions of a tile.
*     ASP = REAL (Given)
*        The target aspect ratio.
*     MARGIN = REAL (Given)
*        Fractional margin around the tiles.  A value of 0.0 indicates
*        abutting tiles.
*     SHAPE( 2 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of tiles to place along each axis.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - There is no validation of the supplied arguments.

      TASP = REAL( DIMS( 1 ) ) / REAL( DIMS( 2 ) )

*  Find the ratio of the target to tile aspect ratios.  The idea is
*  to match the shape of the images best to the chosen map shape, and
*  tile accordingly.  So if this ratio is near 1.0, the number of tiles
*  in each axis should be the same, i.e. the next enclosing square. 
*  Smaller than 1.0 it means that more images will fit across the width
*  of the base picture than will fit the height.
      ASPRAT = SQRT( ASP / TASP )

*  Now find the number of tiles along the side of a square grid to
*  accommodate all the channels.
      GM = NINT( SQRT( REAL( NTILE ) ) + 0.49999 )

*  To determine the best ratio, create various ratios around the square 
*  +/- RANGE tiles.

*  The image has larger aspect ratio than the target.  There will be
*  fewer tiles along the x direction than the y.

*  We need to determine the fraction of the plotting area that would 
*  contain the channel images.  This is the fraction of used frames
*  in the grid, times the fraction of each frame displaying the image.
               USED = REAL( NTILE ) / REAL( NC )

*  The formula for area depends on whether the image is limited in x or
*  y.  Find the aspect ratio of a single grid.  If this is greater than
*  the image aspect ratio, means the image is y-axis limited.
