      SUBROUTINE KPS1_MED<T>( NARR, EL, IPTRS, WORK, ODAT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_MED<T>

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate medians of multiple mapped arrays.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MED<T>( NARR, EL, IPTRS, WORK, ODAT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Takes pointers to a number of mapped arrays, and works out the
*     median of the corresponding elements of each one, storing the
*     result in an output array.

*  Arguments:
*     NARR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of input arrays.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of each array.
*     IPTRS( NARR ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointers to the start of each of the supplied arrays.  Each 
*        has EL elements and is of type <TYPE>.
*     WORK( NARR ) = <TYPE> (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     ODAT( EL ) = <TYPE> (Returned)
*        The array into which the result should be written.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
