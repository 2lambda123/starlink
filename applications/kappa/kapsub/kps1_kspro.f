      REAL FUNCTION KPS1_KSPRO( DIST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PROBKS

*  Purpose:
*     Returns the probability of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     PROB = KPS1_KSPRO( DIST, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     DIST = REAL (Given)
*        Measure of separation of two cumulative distributions.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     KPS1_KSPRO = REAL
*       The probability the samples were identical.

*  Initialise the function.

*  Check the inherited global status.

*  Initialise loop variables.

*  Begin loop.  In most cases 20 iterations should be adequate.

*  Form the sum
         TERM = FLIP * EXP( D2 * REAL( J * J ) )
