      SUBROUTINE KPS1_PUTS( NDIM, DIMS, IVALUE, VALUE, COMMA, INDS,
     :                      LINE, LENG, FULL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_PUTS

*  Purpose:
*     Put the supplied value string in the supplied text line.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      CALL KPS1_PUTS( NDIM, DIMS, IVALUE, VALUE, COMMA, INDS, LINE,
*    :                LENG, FULL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The supplied value string is planted in the text line followed by
*     an optional comma.  The line length and array indices are updated
*     as appropriate.  The routine determines whether or not there is
*     enough room to plant the value string, and returns a logical flag
*     stating what has happened.

*  Arguments:
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimensionality of the object.
*     DIMS( DAT__MXDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimensions of the object.
*     IVALUE = INTEGER (Given)
*        Index to the value if the object is a vector.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Value string.
*     COMMA = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true a comma is written after the value.
*     INDS = CHARACTER (Given and Returned)
*        Array indices
*     LINE = CHARACTER*(*) (Given and Returned)
*        Line of text to be appended
*     LENG = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Current length of the characters in LINE excluding any trailing
*        blanks.
*     FULL = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true the line given was full.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     At present, this ignores the true dimensionality, and produces
*     a list of values seperated by commas.
