      SUBROUTINE KPS1_PRFLT( AXIS, NP, NDIM, POS, MAP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_PRFLT

*  Purpose:
*     Create an AST LutMap for a specific axis.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_PRFLT( AXIS, NP, NDIM, POS, MAP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates an AST LutMap which transforms the 1-D
*     co-ordinate in the input Frame into the co-ordinate on a given axis
*     of a given output Frame. It also fills the supplied 1-D LUT with
*     the corresponding 1-D GRID co-ordinates. It is used by PROFILE.

*  Arguments:
*     AXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the axis within the output Frame for which the LutMap
*        is required.
*     NP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of positions to be described in the look-up-table.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the supplied POS array.
*     POS( NP, NDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        A set of look-up-tables, one for each of the NDIM output axes, each
*        with NP entries. On exit, the row specified by AXIS is set holding
*        values 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ... DBLE( NP ).
*     MAP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AST pointer to the returned LutMap for the required axis.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.
