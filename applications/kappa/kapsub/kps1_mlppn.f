      SUBROUTINE KPS1_MLPPN( PARAM, IGRP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_MLPPN

*  Purpose:
*     Create pen definitons with which to draw each curve.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_MLPPN( PARAM, IGRP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns a group holding AST attribute settings which
*     define the appearance required for each curve drawn by MLINPLOT.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter to use to get the user-specified pens for each
*        curve (should be 'PENS').
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP identifier for a group holding the AST attribute settings
*        defining each pen. The group contains one element for each
*        curve. Each element holds a comma separated list of
*        attribute settings for an AST Plot.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Initialise.

*  Create a new group to contain the pen definitions.

*  Use a semicolon as the separator character because AST required
