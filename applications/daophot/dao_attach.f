C This file contains UNIX specific subroutines relating to the
C input and output of data-- either from CCD picture files or from
C data files containing stellar coordinates and photometric
C quantities.
C
C   This was originally the:
C            OFFICIAL DAO VERSION:  1985 August 16
C
C History :
C   It was modified on 19-FEB-1992, to use NDF files. The NDF files
C   are expected to contain standard Starlink NDF structures as their
C   top-level object. This modified version, called UNIXSUBS_NDF, was
C   copied from the VAX/VMX version VAXSUBS_NDF.

      SUBROUTINE ATTACH(NAFILE,OPEN)
 
*+
*  Name :
*     ATTACH
*
*  Purpose :
*     Interpret an ATTACH command and open an NDF structure
*
*  Invocation :
*     CALL ATTACH( NAFILE, OPEN )
*
*  Description :
*     This is a re-written version of the original Daophot ATTACH
*     routine which accessed Figaro-style data structures. This version
*     uses NDF data files. The present version is written to the
*     specification of the Figaro version, except that the file type is
*     '.SDF' by default:
*
*  Arguments :
*     NAFILE = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The name of the NDF file to be attached.  A file type of '.SDF'
*        is assumed if none is supplied.  The file must contain the (NDF)
*        data structure to be processed as its top-level object.
*     OPEN = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Whether the container file is open.
*
*  Algorithm :
*     On the first call, HDS_START is called to initialise HDS.
*     If there is already a 'DATA' file open, it is closed.
*     A file name is prompted for if it was not supplied.
*     The container file is opened and the OPEN flag is set.
*     The TITLE component is found and displayed (if it exists).
*     The DATA_ARRAY component is found and its shape is checked.
*     It is rejected if it is not 2-dimensional.
*     If the file was rejected it is closed and the OPEN flag is
*     cancelled.
*
*  Deficiencies :
*     The NDF must appear as the top-level object in the data file.
*     The routine takes no specific account of bad pixels, apart from
*     outputting a message if they are present, although the
*     Daophot "minimum valid data value" will cope in most cases.
*
*  Bugs :
*     <description of any "bugs" which have not been fixed>

*  Authors :
*     RFWS: R.F. Warren-Smith (Durham University)
*     NE: Nick Eaton (Durham University)
*
*  History :
*     19-MAY-1988 (RFWS):
*        HDS/NDF version derived from original Daophot ATTACH routine.
*      6-DEC-1991 (NE):
*        NDF version derived from HDS version.
*     19-FEB-1992 (NE):
