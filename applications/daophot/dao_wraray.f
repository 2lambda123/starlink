      SUBROUTINE WRARAY(ENVIRO,LX,LY,MX,MY,NX,FUNC,IFLAG)
 
*+
*  Name :
*     WRARAY
*
*  Purpose :
*     Write a rectangular sub-array to an NDF's DATA_ARRAY
*
*  Invocation :
*     CALL WRARAY( ENVIRO, LX, LY, MX, MY, NX, FUNC, IFLAG )
*
*  Description :
*     This is a re-written version of the original Daophot WRARAY
*     routine which accessed Figaro-style data structures.  This version
*     uses NDF data files. The comments on the original (Figaro)
*     version defined this routine simply as "like RDARAY".  The present
*     version is written to that specification (as far as is possible!),
*     also using some clues from the original (Figaro) code which is
*     roughly similar to this NDF version.
*
*  Arguments :
*     ENVIRO = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The "environment" to which data are to be written. This
*        routine assumes that only the values "DATA" and "COPY" will
*        be used.  It reports an error if any other value is
*        supplied.
*     LX,LY = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The desired coordinates in the DATA_ARRAY of the "first"
*        corner of the subarray to be inserted (i.e. the smaller
*        value of X and smaller value of Y).  The values will be
*        changed on output if the input values would run beyond the
*        bounds of the DATA_ARRAY.  Note, however, that Daophot
*        sometimes passes write-protected arguments here, so they
*        are only written to if it is actually necessary.
*     MX,MY = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The desired number of columns and rows in the subarray.
*        The values will be changed on output if the input values
*        would run beyond the bounds of the DATA_ARRAY.  Note,
*        however, that Daophot sometimes passes write-protected
*        arguments here, so they are only written to if it is
*        actually necessary.
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension size of the FUNC array.
*     FUNC = REAL(NX,*) (Given)
*        Array containing the sub-array data values.  The "first"
*        value (corresponding to location (LX,LY) in the DATA_ARRAY)
*        is taken from FUNC(1,1).
*     IFLAG = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The Daophot error flag.  A zero value is returned if there
*        is no error, otherwise this version of the routine returns
*        an HDS error code.
*
*  Method :
*     Adjust the LX,LY,MX & MY values to lie inside the DATA_ARRAY
*     bounds.  Return if this cannot be done.
*     Obtain an identifier to the appropriate "environment" file.
*     For each row of the sub-array, obtain the appropriate NDF section
*     from the DATA_ARRAY.
*     Write the data into the DATA_ARRAY from the appropriate location
*     in the FUNC array.
*     When all the data have been transferred, report any error.
*     Set the Daophot status flag appropriately.
*
*  Deficiencies :
*     It is not clear whether the sub-array data should "start" in
*     FUNC(1,1) in the event that the sub-array bounds need
*     adjustment to keep them within the DATA_ARRAY.  This routine
*     simply does what the original appeared to do.  It may be
*     that the bounds adjustment part of the code is never executed.
