  <description>OBSERVE --- Check Star Observability</description>
  <abstract><p>
      OBSERVE is designed to allow you to get a quick overview of the
      observability of a star through the year from the geographical
      location selected.  You will be prompted for the RA and Dec of
      the star, the telescope (you can also specify arbitrary
      locations), and the year.  On the selected GKS graphics device a
      plot will be drawn that tells you, for all dates of the year,
      the star rising and setting times and the times that it is
      30degrees above the horizon, the times of astronomical
      twilight, the phase and rising and setting times of the Moon as
      well as its distance from the star in question.
