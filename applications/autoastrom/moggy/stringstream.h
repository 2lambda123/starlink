/* Abstract the stringstream capabilities of the C++ implementation.
   <sstream> is the standard library, but g++, for one example, still
   has only <strstream>: cope with this.  The sstream and strstream
   libraries are subtly different in the way they convert themselves
   to a string.  Use SS_C_STR and SS_STRING instead of the raw str()
   method. */
