This set of reply codes is closely modelled on the SMTP reply system,
as described in RFC 821.  However, it doesn't use the multiline
replies for the two commands -- CONF and SEARCH produce -- which
produce more than one line of response.  In each of these cases,
however, a single status line is sent first, and the subsequent
responses are due to be sent only if that was an OK status.

That is, each command results in one response line, in two cases
followed by further data.

catalogue resources

Connection establishment
  s: 220 OK
  f: 420 Can't start up

CONF
         [ Send configuration file ]
  s: 210 Configuration file follows, terminated by <CRLF>.<CRLF>

  s: 210 Catalogue follows.
         Next line contains a number giving the number of columns, then
         that number of rows containing the column names, then a
         line containing the number of rows, then that number of
         catalogue rows with no further termination.
  e: 501 Wrong number or type of parameters.
     503 Out of order: not all required information has been supplied
  f: 451 Can't connect to catalogue

TYPE <type>
         [ Type can be `BOX', `RADIUS' or
         `RADIUS2', which mean, in turn, that the search should be
         in the box between the points COORD1 and COORD2, within a
         circle centred on COORD1 with radius given by the RADIUS
         command, or a circle centred on COORD1 with radius given by
         COORD1-COORD2.  ]
