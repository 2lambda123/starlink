This set of reply codes is closely modelled on the SMTP reply system,
as described in RFC 821 (see, eg,
<http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/821/29.htm>).  However, it doesn't
use the multiline replies for the two commands -- CONF and SEARCH
produce -- which produce more than one line of response.  In each of
these cases, however, a single status line is sent first, and the
subsequent responses are due to be sent only if that was an OK status.

That is, each command results in one response line, in two cases
followed by further data.

catalogue resources

Connection establishment
  s: 220 OK
  f: 420 Can't start up

AST FRAMESET <domain>
AST NONE
	 [ Set up AST mapping information.  In the first case, the
	   command specifies the name of an AST domain.  The reply
	   from moggy is 350; this is followed on stdin by the contents
	   of an AST serialisation of a FrameSet (ie, the `Begin
	   FrameSet ... End FrameSet'), followed by `<CRLF>.<CRLF>';
	   moggy replies with 250.  The domain given is the domain in
	   which COORD1 and COORD2 positions will be supplied, and in
	   which SEARCH results will be returned.  The command `AST
	   NONE' turns off the AST capabilities, so that coordinates
	   must again be supplied in RA-Dec. ]
  s: 350 Command accepted -- send frameset
     250 Frameset created successfully
     250 Frameset deleted
  e: 501 Wrong number or type of parameters
     501 Syntax error -- unrecognised keyword
     504 Unrecognised domain

AST CONVERT <double> <double> TOSKY|FROMSKY
	  [ Convert coordinates to or from Sky coordinates.
	    This must have been preceded by a `AST FRAMESET' command.
	    Sky coordinates are in decimal degrees, and device
	    coordinates are in whichever domain was specified in the
	    preceding `AST FRAMESET' command.  This has nothing much to do
	    with catalogue searching, but it's the sort of thing one
	    needs to do when manipulating catalogues, and it's easy to 
	    implement here. ]
  s: 210 Result follows.
         Next line contains two doubles containing the result.
  e: 501 Wrong number or type of parameters
     503 No preceding AST FRAMESET command

CATCONFIG string
	 [ Set the URL of a catalogue configuration file ]
  s: 250 Parameter set successfully
  e: 501 Wrong number or type of parameters

COLUMNS string
         [ Set the return columns -- either ALL for all columns, or
           SIMPLE for the standard id,ra,dec.  This must be called
           after NAME. ]
  s: 250 Parameter set successfully
  e: 501 Wrong number or type of parameters
     503 Out of order: not all required information has been supplied

CONF
         [ Send configuration file ]
  s: 210 Configuration file follows, terminated by <CRLF>.<CRLF>
         Like the message says, the configuration file appears on stdout.
  e: 551 Unspecified problem obtaining configuration     
     501 Wrong number or type of parameters
     505 Unimplemented
  f: 450 Can't connect to server, or otherwise can't generate config file

           <ra-h> <ra-min> <ra-sec> <dec-deg> <dec-min> <dec-sec>
	   <equinox>, with equinox being optional (default=J2000).  If
	   the AST command has been supplied, then the coordinates are 
	   in the specified domain. ]
  s: 250 Parameter set successfully
  e: 501 Wrong number or type of parameters.

NAME <string>
	 [ Specify name of catalogue to search ]
  s: 250 Parameter set successfully

     552 Unknown catalogue

NROW <int>
         [ limit number of rows to return ]
  s: 250 Parameter set successfully
  e: 501 Syntax error: missing parameter or can't convert to positive integer

QUIT
         [ Exit ]
  s: 220 Goodbye
  e: 500 Syntax error

RADIUS <float>
	 [ Set the search radius.  Parameter is in arcmin. ]
  s: 250 Parameter set successfully
  e: 501 Wrong number or type of parameters.

SEARCH
	 [ Perform catalogue search. ]
  s: 210 Catalogue follows.
         Next line contains a number giving the number of columns, then
         that number of rows containing the column names, then a
         line containing the number of rows, then that number of
         catalogue rows with no further termination.
  e: 501 Wrong number or type of parameters.
     503 Out of order: not all required information has been supplied
  f: 451 Can't connect to catalogue

STATUS
         [ Show status.  Mostly for debugging ]
  s: 210 Status follows, terminated by <CRLF>.<CRLF>
  e: 501 Syntax error

TYPE <type>
         [ Type can be `BOX', `RADIUS' or `RADIUS2', which mean, in
         turn, that the search should be in the box between the points
         COORD1 and COORD2, within a circle centred on COORD1 with
         radius given by the RADIUS command, or a circle centred on
         COORD1 with radius given by COORD1-COORD2.  Note that,
         because of the way that individual catalogue handlers
         implement this, it is not actually guaranteed that there will
         be no results returned outside the specified area, so if it
         matters, the results should be checked by the caller, or
         otherwise post-processed. ]
  s: 250 Parameter set successfully.
  e: 501 Wrong number or type of parameters.
  e: 502 Unrecognised search type
