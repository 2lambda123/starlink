dnl   Check for a Perl binary, looking in the likely Starlink area
dnl   first.  We need to do more than just AC_PATH_PROG(PERLPATH,
dnl   perl, noperl, /star/Perl/bin:/stardev/Perl/bin:$PATH), since we
dnl   must additionally check that the perl which we find is new
dnl   enough that it can load autoastrom.pm.
dnl
dnl   In fact, Moggy.pm currently _requires_ StarPerl (that is,
dnl   vanilla perl won't work), since it uses autoastrom.pm, which in turn
dnl   loads the NDF library; it only uses deg2sex from autoastrom.pm,
dnl   however, so that if it were desirable to make Moggy independent
dnl   of autoastrom, this function would have to be copied over.  If
dnl   this were done, then the test for Perl could revert to the
dnl   simple one above.
AC_CHECKING(whether we can find a suitable Perl)
starpath="/star/Perl/bin /stardev/Perl/bin"

dnl   Similarly, check for uncompress and gzip programs
AC_PATH_PROG(PROGUNCOMPRESS, uncompress)
AC_PATH_PROG(PROGGZIP, gzip)

dnl   Check for other tools
AC_PROG_RANLIB

dnl   Use C++ to compile test programs
AC_LANG([C++])

dnl   Check if we've got sstream.  If not, we'll assume we have the older
dnl   strstream.
AC_CHECK_HEADERS([sstream strstream map])

dnl   Use C for checks after this
AC_LANG_PUSH(C)
AC_CHECK_DECLS([setenv, getenv, unsetenv, putenv])
AC_CHECK_FUNCS([setenv getenv unsetenv putenv])
AC_LANG_POP(C)

dnl   Check whether we need to include `-lnsl -lsocket' to use the
dnl   socket() call and friends (catlib needs these functions, and you
dnl   do need these on Solaris)
AC_CHECK_FUNC(gethostbyname,,
  AC_CHECK_LIB(nsl, gethostbyname))
AC_CHECK_FUNC(socket,,
  AC_CHECK_LIB(socket, socket,,,-lnsl))

dnl   Do we have to add any platform-specific compiler flags.  We
dnl   could do this by using AC_CANONICAL_HOST to detect the platform
dnl   and add things that way, but it's rather error-prone, since it
dnl   depends on config.guess being up-to-date, and possibly on
dnl   compilers not changing.  Try compiling with a sequence of added
dnl   CXXFLAGS and go with the first one that works.  The streams
dnl   support is the only one that appears to matter -- others may be
dnl   added here in future.
dnl
dnl   The alpha cxx compiler currently (v6.0) needs to be invoked with
dnl   `-std strict_ansi' (or with __USE_STD_IOSTREAM defined), so that
dnl   it uses a standards-conforming streams library.  See Digital C++
dnl   v6.0 manual, section 7.1.2, at eg,
dnl   <http://h30097.www3.hp.com/cplus/ugu.htm>
dnl
dnl   XXX This _doesn't_ work on cxx V6.5 at least:
dnl   catlib-install/include/cat/CatalogInfo.h includes iostream.h,
dnl   which includes iostream.hxx (the old library interface), which
dnl   has an explicit check for __NO_USE_STD_IOSTREAM (should be
dnl   exclusive with __USE_STD_IOSTREAM) and refuses to load unless
dnl   it's defined.  That's a bigger problem to deal with....

dnl   Find where the SkyCat cat library has been installed.
dnl   This must go _before_ the check for the STARLINK directories:
dnl   since -L$CATLIBDIR/lib must go before -L/star/lib, if we are to
dnl   find our (modified) libcat.a before the standard starlink one.

dnl   Find which AST libraries we want to use.  The -I and -L specifiers must
dnl   go at the _beginning_ of the list of libraries, so that the
dnl   given directory is searched before /star
AC_ARG_WITH(ast,

dnl   Following tests need the ast_link collection of libraries to be
dnl   specified in LIBS.  This will work, because we've make sure that
dnl   the appropriate -L option in already in LIBS, when we processed
dnl   --with-starlink above.
dnl LIBS="$LIBS `ast_link`"




dnl   Now that we've found the /star (or other AST) directories, check
dnl   that ast.h is there.  There was a problem with ast.h which meant
dnl   it caused the Tru64 C++ compiler to object (this is certainly
dnl   fixed by AST 1.8-1).  This is therefore more direct than the
dnl   obvious alternative of testing for the preprocessor constants
dnl   AST_{MAJOR,MINOR}_VERS.

dnl   Check that the $LIBS path we now have does work for linking
dnl   against the AST function astOK_.  Note that we do provide a
dnl   non-null action-if-found, here.  The default prepends -last to
dnl   $LIBS, but we want to ensure that that stays safely behind
dnl   -Last-dir (there's no difference for Linux ld, for example, but
dnl   DUX ld has -L options apply only to the -l options which follow them).

  AC_MSG_ERROR([[consider defining STARLINK to point to a newer distribution, or give an alternative AST location using --with-ast]]))

dnl   Do we have the wcslib glsfwd function?  This might be in
dnl   ast_wcslib (if that's very old) or in $CATLIBDIR/lib/libcat.a
dnl   (it might have been _removed_ from the latter by the autoastrom
dnl   makefile, if it is present in ast_wcslib).  If we can't find a
dnl   copy, we supply one ourselves in SkyCatHoles.c -- see the
dnl   discussion of this problem in that file.
