/* Small fragments of code to make up for the mildly filleted version
   of SkyCat libcat which this program uses.

   SkyCat's libcat (confusingly distinct from Starlink's libcat!) includes
   both some of Mark Calabretta's WCS code (wcslib) and some of Pat Wallace's
   SLALIB code, however these conflict with code included in Starlink
   libast_wcslib and libast_slalib.

   No problem: I can create a custom SkyCat libcat without the
   problematic code and link against that (see ../makefile).  That
   fails, however, because of the way that wcslib and slalib have been
   integrated into these particular AST glue libraries.

   The code in this module addresses two issues:

   (1) The SkyCat library libcat.a includes modules proj.o and cel.o,
   which are from some oldish version of wcslib.  The latter refers to
   functions glsfwd and glsrev, which, as I see from AST's wcsmap.c,
   have been renamed sflfwd and sflrev in newer versions (it's changed
   in AST 1.8-1, but isn't in the version of AST with ast.h dated
   2000-02-08), so if we are to use such newer versions, we must
   provide a translation routine.  So that we can continue to use this
   route with older versions of AST, include these translations only
   if HAVE_GLSFWD is defined.  The libcat that we actually link
   against is edited within ../makefile to try to make sure that
   there's no duplication of functions (see config/configure.in).

   Note (not a propos of very much) that wcslib functions azpfwd,
   azprev, etc, have been renamed astAzpfwd, astAzprev, etc, in later
   versions of AST (post-1.8-1), and these AST versions (using a
   slightly different context struct -- AstPrjPrm instead of wcslib's
   prjprm) can be deemed to have diverged from the wcslib routines.
   This case is easy, and we don't need to do anything special,
   because the proj.o modules within libskycat can be used (ie, it
   appears that we do not need to link against specifically
   libwcslib.a).

   (2) Code within SkyCat refers to a function slaDeuler, which
   presumably maps to sla_deuler, but that function is omitted from
   AST's sla.c.  We define void slaDeuler here, patterned after the
   functions in AST's sla.c.  The prototype of slaDeuler is from
   catlib/astrotcl/wcslib/src/slasubs.c.  The only difference is that
   AST:sla.c declares the rotation matrices as `double rmat[3][3]',
   whereas catlib:slasubs.c declares them as `double (*rmat)[3]'.
   These are equivalent, since the first is equivalent to `rmat[][3]',
   which is in turn equivalent to the second form (cf. K&R Sect.5.7).
