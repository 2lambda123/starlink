# Plugin for autoastrom, which uses match
# <http://acd188a-005.rit.edu/match/> to do the matching.
#
# To work as an autoastrom plugin, we have to define a routine which
# takes the correct arguments, and store a reference to it in
# $helpers{plugin-match-xxx}, where `xxx' is the name which will be
# used to refer to it.
#
# The arguments are:
#
#    my $helpers = shift;	# Reference to hash of helper programs.
#    my $cat1 = shift;		# First position catalogue
#    my $cat2 = shift;		# Second position catalogue
#    my $matchopts = shift;	# Reference to hash of options
#				# (may include {poserr}, {objsize},
#				# {area}).  Crucially may also contain
#				# element {method}, which can be
#				# `findoff', the default, or the name
#				# of some other program loaded in a plugin.
#    my $tempfn = shift;	# Temporary filename prefix
#
# The catalogues are hash references with entries {catalogue},
# containing an array of hashes with fields {id}, {x} and {y} at
# least; and {provenance}, containing a string which reports where it
# came from.
#
# Return an array containing the two catalogues, in the same order as
# the corresponding input files, plus a flag (1=ok, 0=error)
# indicating whether the match succeeded or not.  The returned
# catalogues must have the same fields as the corresponding input
# catalogues.
