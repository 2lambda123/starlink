AutoAstrometry of Mosaics
-------------------------

%%VERSION%%    0.4


This is a developers' release of the autoastrometry package.

Documentation, including release notes, is in sun242.tar-htx

At present, you'll probably need to define the STARLINK environment
variable to point to the /stardev tree.  If you have CCDPACK_DIR and
ATOOLS_DIR defined, make sure that these are pointing to at least
versions 4.0-1 and 1.3 respectively.  It's probably best if KAPPA_DIR
and EXTRACTOR_DIR are pointing at /stardev versions, too, just on
general principles.

To build, give the sequence of commands

    ./mk build
    ./mk install

There's a pre-installation regression test:

    # Define AUTOASTROM_DIR to point to a temporary directory, which
    # must exist.
    ./mk test-install
    ./mk pretest

A couple of regression tests fail on DUX, apparently due to rounding
errors somewhere.

The regression test t/t9 (which consists of two runs of autoastrom
right after each other) seems to hang on rlspc5 at RAL (though it
works on my box in Glasgow), with an error which suggests that the
Perl/ADAM system has got itself into a terminal fankle.  I suspect
that this is caused by something like the monoliths from the first run
not being fully shut down before the second starts, and thus it's to
do with the lack of a robust exit handler in autoastrom (coming
next!).
