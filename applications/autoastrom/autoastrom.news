AutoAstrometry of Mosaics
-------------------------

%%VERSION%%    0.3


This is a quick initial release of the autoastrometry package.

It does nothing much yet, except contain the moggy package (an
interface to the SkyCat libraries).

To build, give the sequence of commands

    ./configure --with-cat=....
    make
    make test

You need to have a copy of the SkyCat libraries installed, and use
--with-cat to point to its location.
