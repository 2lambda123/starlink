AutoAstrometry of Mosaics
-------------------------

%%VERSION%%    0.5-3


This is a developers' release of the autoastrometry package.

Documentation, including release notes, is in sun242.tar-htx

Changes
-------

Since 0.5: 
  * Fixed typo in function name which made some informational
    messages fatal.
  * Extractor sometimes claims to detect objects with a negative flux
    -- such objects are now silently ignored.
  * Assorted changes to configuration to make it more robust.
  * All of autoastrom that originates purely within Starlink has been
    released under the GPL.  This does NOT include the bundled version
    of ASTROM, nor the decompose_transform routine in autoastrom.pm,
    both of which are Copyright 1995 Patrick Wallace.  See
    README.Licence.
  * Uses bundled ASTROM 3.7, which emits FITS WCS headers which 
    extend the draft `Paper II' proposals.  See ASTROM docs for discussion.

Notes
-----

At present, you'll probably need to define the STARLINK environment
variable to point to the /stardev tree.  If you have CCDPACK_DIR and
ATOOLS_DIR defined, make sure that these are pointing to at least
versions 4.0-1 and 1.3 respectively.  It's probably best if KAPPA_DIR
and EXTRACTOR_DIR are pointing at /stardev versions, too, just on
general principles.

To build, give the sequence of commands

    ./mk build
    ./mk install

There's a pre-installation regression test:

    # Define AUTOASTROM_DIR to point to a temporary directory, which
    # must exist.
    ./mk test-install
    ./mk pretest

A couple of regression tests fail on DUX, apparently due to rounding
errors somewhere.

This version includes plugins, and specifically a plugin to support
the `match' application to be found at
<http://acd188a-005.rit.edu/match/>.  The distribution does not,
however, include the match distribution, so you need to build that
yourself and install it in the directory $AUTOASTROM_DIR.

The regression test t/t9 (which consists of two runs of autoastrom
right after each other) seems to hang on rlspc5 at RAL (though it
works on my box in Glasgow), with an error which suggests that the
Perl/ADAM system has got itself into a terminal fankle.  I suspect
that this is caused by something like the monoliths from the first run
not being fully shut down before the second starts, but I don't have a 
more specific explanation than that.
