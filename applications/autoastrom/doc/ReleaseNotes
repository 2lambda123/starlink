<p>This is release 0.4 $Date$</p>

<p><strong>THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  Some features work only partially or
unreliably.  It does not have all the functionality of a
production release.  The interface may well
change.</strong></p>

<p>Autoastrom requires AST 1.8-1 or better to build.  Depending	on
precisely which earlier version of AST you have, the moggy tool will
fail to compile, or if it compiles, fail to link.  If you have AST
installed in a non-standard place, you should use the
<code>STARLINKS</code> environment variable at build time (see <ref
id="build"/>), to tell the build script where to find it.</p>

<subhead><title>Version 0.3</title></subhead>

<p>This is release 0.3 Date: 2001/08/29 17:09:52 </p>

<p><strong>THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  Some features work only partially or
unreliably.  It does not have all the functionality of a
production release.  The interface may well
change.</strong></p>

<p>This release is still lacking some functionality.  In particular
<ul>
<li><p>the initial approximate astrometry must be supplied as a WCS
component in the input NDF -- a future version will allow this to be
either specified on the command line or picked up from any FITS
headers in the file;</p></li>
<li><p>this can handle only single CCDs, rather than mosaics;</p></li>
<li><p>I need to do some experimentation to discover how robust the whole 
kit is to errors in the initial astrometry.</p></li>
</ul></p>
