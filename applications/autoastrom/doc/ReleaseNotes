<subhead><title>Version 0.3</title></subhead>

<p>This is release 0.3</p>

<p><strong>THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  Some features work only partially or
unreliably.  It does not have all the functionality of a
production release.  The interface may well
change.</strong></p>

<p>This release is still lacking some functionality.  In particular
<ul>
<li>the initial approximate astrometry must be supplied as a WCS
component in the input NDF -- a future version will allow this to be
either specified on the command line or picked up from any FITS
headers in the file;</li>
<li>this can handle only single CCDs, rather than mosaics;</li>
<li>I need to do some experimentation to discover how robust the whole 
kit is to errors in the initial astrometry.</li>
</ul></p>
