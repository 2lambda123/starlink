<subhead><title>Version 0.5-2</title></subhead>

<p>Changes since version 0.5-1:
<ul>
  <li><p>Fixed sexagesimal-to-decimal bug, so that negative Decs are
    now converted correctly (thanks to Peter Draper for diagnosing
    this).</p></li>
  <li><p>More adjustments to configuration code, to make it more robust
    against potential version-skew (it now builds correctly on RH8).</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Changes since version 0.5:
<ul>
  <li><p>The bulk of the code is now under the terms of the GPL.
    However, not all of it is: see the notes in
    <code>README.Licence</code>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Fixed typo in function name which made some informational
    messages fatal.</p></li>
  <li><p>Extractor sometimes claims to detect objects with a negative flux
    -- such objects are now silently ignored.</p></li>
  <li><p>Assorted changes to configuration to make it more robust.</p></li>
</ul>

  <p>This is release 0.5.</p>

  <p><strong>THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  Some features work only partially or
      unreliably.  It does not have all the functionality of a
      production release.  The interface may well
      change.</strong></p>

  <p>See the <ref id="release-0.4" >version 0.4 release notes</ref>
    for building guidelines.</p>

  <p>Changes since version 0.4:
    <ul>
      <li><p>&autoastrom; now supports plugins, and there is one plugin
	supplied, for the `match' matching application available at
	<url>http://acd188a-005.rit.edu/match/</url>.  This is not
	distributed with &autoastrom;, but it is easy to download,
	build, and install in the directory
	<code>$AUTOASTROM_DIR</code>.</p></li>

      <li><p>Now, if you type Control-C, &autoastrom; will delete the
	monoliths it is using, and tidy up after itself.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<subsect id="release-0.4" export="export">
<subhead><title>Version 0.4</title></subhead>

<p>This is release 0.4, Date: 2001/11/05 15:58:21</p>

<p><strong>THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  Some features work only partially or
unreliably.  It does not have all the functionality of a
production release.  The interface may well
change.</strong></p>

<p>At present, you'll probably need to define the
<code>STARLINK</code> environment variable to point to the /stardev
tree.  If you have <code>CCDPACK_DIR</code> and
<code>ATOOLS_DIR</code> defined, make sure that these are pointing to
at least versions 4.0-1 and 1.3 respectively.</p>

<p>To build, give the sequence of commands
<verbatim>
    ./mk build
    ./mk install
</verbatim></p>

<p>There's a pre-installation regression test:
<verbatim>
    # Define AUTOASTROM_DIR to point to a temporary directory, which
    # must exist.
    ./mk test-install
    ./mk pretest
</verbatim></p>

<p>A couple of regression tests fail on DUX, apparently due to rounding
errors somewhere.</p>

<p>Autoastrom requires:
<dl>

<dt>AST 1.8-1</dt>
<dd><p>Depending on
precisely which earlier version of AST you have, the moggy tool will
fail to compile, or if it compiles, fail to link.  If you have AST
installed in a non-standard place, you should use the
<code>STARLINK</code> environment variable at build time (see <ref
id="build"/>), to tell the build script where to find it.</p></dd>

<dt>ATOOLS 1.3</dt>
<dd><p>This will be on the next Starlink CD, but is available at present
	from David Berry.</p></dd>

<dt>CCDPACK 4.0-1</dt>
<dd><p>This will be on the next Starlink CD, but is available at present
	from Mark Taylor.</p></dd>

</dl>
</p>


  <p>Changes since v0.3:
    <ul>
      <li><p>The distribution builds successfully on Alpha (with the 
	cxx compiler), Solaris (with CC) and Linux (with gcc).  There is no
	post-installation test yet, but you can run a pre-installation
	self-test with <code>./mk pretest</code>.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>The astrometry can now come from a FITS extension or from the
	commandline (<code>--obsdata</code> switch).</p></li>

      <li><p>Handles FITS dates more robustly, specifically including
	pre-2000 FITS dates.</p></li>

      <li><p>Notes in the documentation and within the program chatter
	about <code>http_proxy</code>.</p></li>

      <li><p>Fixed a silly bug which means that the script does now work
	for negative Decs.</p></li>

      <li><p>Report more coherent information to the user.</p></li>

    </ul>

<subhead><title>Version 0.3</title></subhead>

<p>This is release 0.3, Date: 2001/08/29 17:09:52</p>

<p><strong>THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  Some features work only partially or
unreliably.  It does not have all the functionality of a
production release.  The interface may well
change.</strong></p>

<p>This release is still lacking some functionality.  In particular
<ul>
<li><p>the initial approximate astrometry must be supplied as a WCS
component in the input NDF -- a future version will allow this to be
either specified on the command line or picked up from any FITS
headers in the file;</p></li>
<li><p>this can handle only single CCDs, rather than mosaics;</p></li>
<li><p>I need to do some experimentation to discover how robust the whole 
kit is to errors in the initial astrometry.</p></li>
</ul></p>
