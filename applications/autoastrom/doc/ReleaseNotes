<p>This is release 0.4 $Date$</p>

<p><strong>THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  Some features work only partially or
unreliably.  It does not have all the functionality of a
production release.  The interface may well
change.</strong></p>

<p>Autoastrom requires:
<dl>

<dt>AST 1.8-1</dt>
<dd><p>Depending on
precisely which earlier version of AST you have, the moggy tool will
fail to compile, or if it compiles, fail to link.  If you have AST
installed in a non-standard place, you should use the
<code>STARLINKS</code> environment variable at build time (see <ref
id="build"/>), to tell the build script where to find it.</p></dd>

<dt>ATOOLS 1.3</dt>
<dd><p>This will be on the next Starlink CD, but is available at present
	from David Berry.</p></dd>

<dt>CCDPACK 4.0-1</dt>
<dd><p>This will be on the next Starlink CD, but is available at present
	from Mark Taylor.</p></dd>

</dl>
</p>


  <p>Changes since v0.3:
    <ul>
      <li><p>The distribution builds successfully on Alpha (with the 
	cxx compiler), Solaris (with CC) and Linux (with gcc).  There is no
	post-installation test yet, but you can run a pre-installation
	self-test with <code>./mk pretest</code>.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>The astrometry can now come from a FITS extension or from the
	commandline (<code>--obsdata</code> switch).</p></li>

      <li><p>Handles FITS dates more robustly, specifically including
	pre-2000 FITS dates.</p></li>

      <li><p>Notes in the documentation and within the program chatter
	about <code>http_proxy</code>.</p></li>

      <li><p>Fixed a silly bug which means that the script does now work
	for negative Decs.</p></li>

      <li><p>Report more coherent information to the user.</p></li>

    </ul>

<subhead><title>Version 0.3</title></subhead>

<p>This is release 0.3 Date: 2001/08/29 17:09:52 </p>

<p><strong>THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  Some features work only partially or
unreliably.  It does not have all the functionality of a
production release.  The interface may well
change.</strong></p>

<p>This release is still lacking some functionality.  In particular
<ul>
<li><p>the initial approximate astrometry must be supplied as a WCS
component in the input NDF -- a future version will allow this to be
either specified on the command line or picked up from any FITS
headers in the file;</p></li>
<li><p>this can handle only single CCDs, rather than mosaics;</p></li>
<li><p>I need to do some experimentation to discover how robust the whole 
kit is to errors in the initial astrometry.</p></li>
</ul></p>
