1 SPECX - v6.8-4

 - Fix problem with DAS-MERGE command not accepting different
   answers to the quadrant adjustment and wideband mode (present
   since v6.7-8)
 - Trap cases where the velocity frame was not recognized by SPECX.
   (in many cases HEL was not a match for HELI - now only match first
   3 characters of string).

1 SPECX - v6.8-3

 - Fix rddualgsd and rdwidesp macros
 - Fix "random" bug in file creation on linux

1 SPECX - v6.8-2

 Fixes a problem introduced in v6.8-1 that prevents specx from creating
 new maps.

1 SPECX - v6.8-1
 Fixes a bug in the DATE-OBS parser on Linux.
 
 Compares the size of the POSN array with the number of spectra specified
 in the map header and corrects things if there is an inconsistency.
 
 Also traps the case where a spectrum is requested that is higher than
 the number of spectra in the map.

1 SPECX - v6.8
 New Command: SET-DATA-DIRECTORY
 to change $DATADIR without restarting SPECX
 
 New Command: SWITCH-DATE
 to change a date part of the DATADIR environment variable and/or a GSD file
 prefix.
 
 WRITE-ASCII-SPECTRUM now includes more significant figures for the frequency
 scale.
 
 SET-GSD-FILENAME can now support a prefix up to 100 characters.
 
 Bugs fixed.
 -----------
 Problem on Linux with interactive plotting mode where the cursor would
 move to random position after selecting a point on the spectrum.
 
 READ_GSD ensure variable state retained between calls
 
 SETX Only copy required quadrants.
 
 XSNART Prevent infinite loop on Linux (addressing 0th element of array).
 
 FSW.SPX Use '!' instead of 'or' in IF statement.
 
1 SPECX - v6.7-13
 An improved fix for the bug in file-merge fixed in v6.7-12.
 The TOFITS and GSD2FITS macros have been extended to support wideband spectra.
 
1 SPECX - v6.7-12

 Fixes a bug causing false Fortran I/O error reports on Linux.
 Fixes a bug causing file-merge not to work on Linux. 
 Improves startup messages.
 
1 SPECX - v6.7-11

 Fixes a bug which leads to problems for data with large redshifts.

1 SPECX - v6.7-10

 Corrects a non-standard FORMAT statement, which caused a crash, in
 SET_WEIGHTS.F.
  
1 SPECX - v6.7-9

 Corrects a bug in writing the current mapplane to a FITS file, which caused
 memory allocation error on Linux.

1 SPECX - v6.7-8

 This version will also compile and run under Linux. Structure handling has
 been re-written in C and the code made more compliant with the Fortran
 standard in order to achieve this.

 "Native" PGPLOT is used instead of "Starlink" (GKS) PGPLOT so there is some
 difference from previous versions in graphics device naming and behaviour.

 A bug which may have resulted in incorrect times being computed when writing
 FITS files has been corrected.  Some messages have been changed to avoid
 VMSisms.

 SUN/17 has been updated.


1 SPECX - Millimetre-wave Spectral data reduction - v6.7-7

 SPECX version 6.7-7 is now available. This release contains minor patches 
 and an updated SUN/17 document.

 Changes in this release are:

  o Add wideband support to DAS-MERGE command

  o FITS DATE header is now Y2K compliant

  o Fix problem translating some dates from the GSD header 
    value due to a loss of  precision.

  o Fix problem reading old GSD files that did not know about rastering.
