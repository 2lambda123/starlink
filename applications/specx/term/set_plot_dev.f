      SUBROUTINE SET_PLOT_DEVICE (IERR)
C      
C subroutine to set up SPECX for a new plot device
C
C Arguments:
C
C      IERR     (integer, returned)  error return - 
C                                     0  = success
C                                     21 = unavailable device
C
C sets the following variables passed through by FLAGCOMM
C
C      IDEV     (integer, update)    given old plot device
C                                    returned new plot device
C      TERMINAL (logical, returned)  true if device is a terminal

C based entirely on code in SET-PLOT-DEVICE, 
C but implemented to facilitate graphics independence.
