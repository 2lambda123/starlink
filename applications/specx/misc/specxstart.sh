#
#  Purpose:
#     Start the Specx package from the C shell.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     Shell command list
#
#  Invocation:
#     , specxstart
#
#  Description:
#     This procedure starts the Specx package for use from the C shell by
#     setting a couple of environment variables and an alias to run the
#     executable programme.
#
#  Prior Requirements (edited for STANDALONE by Remo Tilanus)
#
#        SYS_SPECX: The directory with the executable system, including
#           standard command files. Normally .../.../specx
#
   if test -z $SYS_SPECX; then
     echo ' '
     echo '   You have to define SYS_SPECX to point to the SPECX directory,'
     echo '   i.e. export SYS_SPECX=.../.../specx.'
     echo ' '
     echo '   Then type: source ${SYS_SPECX}/specxstart to initialize the'
     echo '   SPECX environment. Then type specx to start the programme.'
     echo ' '
     echo '   You may want to edit specx.csh and put it somewhere in your'
     echo '   path as specx to do this for you or put the initialization'
     echo '   in your .profile file'
     echo ' '

#  There is a file used by a READ/NAMELIST statement to set initial
#  values for a number of parameters. It is known as $SPECX_INIT.
#

#
#  There is also the user's file which is @-ed at startup. If the user
#  has not yet set $SPXINIT to point to her own such file, then we will
#  use a default one.
