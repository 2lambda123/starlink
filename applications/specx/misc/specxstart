#  Purpose:
#     Start the Specx package from the C shell.

#  Type of Module:
#     C shell command list
#
#  Invocation:
#     source specxstart

#  Description:
#     This procedure starts the Specx package for use from the C shell by
#     setting a couple of environment variables and an alias to run the
#     executable programme.
#
#  Prior Requirements (edited for STANDALONE by Remo Tilanus)
#
#        SYS_SPECX: The directory with the executable system, including
#           standard command files. Normally .../.../specx
#

     echo '   You have to define SYS_SPECX to point to the SPECX directory,'
     echo '   i.e. setenv SYS_SPECX .../.../specx.'
     echo ' '
     echo '   Then type: source ${SYS_SPECX}/specxstart to initialize the'

#  values for a number of parameters. It is known as $SPECX_INIT.

#
#  There is also the user's file which is @-ed at startup. If the user
#  has not yet set $SPXINIT to point to her own such file, then we will
#  use a default one.
