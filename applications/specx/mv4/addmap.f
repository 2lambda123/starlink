*  History:
*     17 Dec 1993 (hme):
*        In order to adapt to new STACKCOMM/PROTOTYPE, no longer use
*        TSYS as start of scan header, since it isn't any more.
*     13 Aug 1994 (hme):
*        Use MV4_PROTWR instead of discarded WRITE_PROT_HEADER.
*        Replace TOMAP with ADDMAP2. Leave writing the index to ADDMAP2.
