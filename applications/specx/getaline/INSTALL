                           GET_ALINE


The installation of 'get_aline' is very simple.

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If readline can not be located, get_aline will be built without
readline support (configure will tell you).


Linking
-------------

To use this library after it has been installed, the getaline_link
command is made available to users to simplify the link arguments.
It will only contain the libraries required to link getaline and
takes into account whether readline was used in the build.

getaline_link will substitute the correct link commands when used
within back-quotes in a compile statement:

        cc csample.c `get_aline_link` -o csample
