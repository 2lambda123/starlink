                           GET_ALINE


The installation of 'get_aline' is very simple. Too simple for
a Makefile.

Use:
----
     See get_aline.l

Compilation:
------------

     (g)cc  -c  [ -DNEED_RINDEX | -DNO_READLINE ]  get_aline.c

 NEED_RINDEX: systems which do not have index and rindex installed
              (e.g.Sunos5.x) can and probably should use this option.
              Clearly, linking errors to the effect that index/rindex
              are undefined are an indication it should be used.
              (NOTE: for STARLINK it also looks at the SYSTEM
               variable. If you find you need rindex, you can also
               add your STARLINK system definition in get_aline.c.
               Look for sun4_Solaris.)

NO_READLINE:  to compile applications on systems which do not
              have the READLINE library from GNU's Bash distribution.
              Get_aline will use the standard I/O function
              fgets instead. Command-line editing etc. will not be
              available.


Installation:
-------------

Put the object file somewhere (optional) and edit get_aline_link to
reflect its location as well as the location of GNU's readline library
(if present). For ease of use put get_aline_link in a directory which
is in users' paths (e.g. /usr/local/bin).
Get_aline_link will substitute the correct link commands when used
within back-quotes in a compile statement:

        cc csample.c `get_aline_link` -o csample
