Changes made to setx.f:

Tim Jenness 1996/06/05


------


Put SNGL and DBLE round variables to match up data types

eg    realvar = SNGL(doublevar)

Rename XSCALE as XSCALE8 if double precision so that it doesn't get confused
with XSCALE everywhere else. (Same for XFAC and XFAC8)

SUBROUTINE SETX8

	Change call to SETXPTS so that passes first member of XFAC8 NOT
	the entire array (it expects a single value) to make things explicit


    Problems:

	Call to SETXASTRO.  IUTFLG is a LOGICAL but the COMMON block
	(stackcomm) defines IUTFLG as a BYTE!
	Can I just change the COMMON BLOCK? and IUTFLG = .TRUE. instead of 1


SUBROUTINE SETXFREST

	Change IF statement so that now checks if DOUBLE is greater than
	small number rather than NOT_EQUAL to 0

SUBROUTINE SETXDOPP

	First argument is DOUBLE but CHANGE_SIDEBAND passes a REAL.

	This is okay from reduce/lsrcor.f (REAL*8 - change to DOUBLE?)
	and in exprt/calc_image.f

	
Changes to reduce/change_sb.f:


	Change DF to DOUBLE PRECISION
