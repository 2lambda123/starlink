      SUBROUTINE MERGE (XSCALE, IFAIL)

C  Routine to match up quadrants of correlator data by applying
C  a constant offset to quadrants other than the first..
C  A minimum Chi-square fit is made to the difference of the
C  overlapping spectra, assuming that the offset is constant
C  and that the noise temperature in each quadrant rises as 1/x
C  toward the end of the quadrant.

C  In order to simplify the programming the routine uses the 
C  array XSCALE in a non-standard way. Hence the values in this
C  array at the end of the call may not be correct.

C  Find out whether offset between sectors is to be estimated or not

C      CALL GEN_YESNO ('Are sectors to be offset?', SECTOR_OFFSET,
C     &                 SECTOR_OFFSET, ISTAT)

C  First check that data is from correlator or similar instrument

C  Initialize any variables

C  Save data and frequency related flags/variables before
C  changing the latter temporarily. (Will be restored before
C  returning to main program)

      CALL PUSH

C  Get data arranged so that XSCALE(I) increases within quadrants and
C  by quadrants
C  ..First, by quadrants:

C     Sort into increasing frequency order, then
C     use this information to do a fast sort of other arrays

      CALL SPECX_JSORT   (NQUAD, JFCEN, ISOURCE)
      CALL SPECX_REORDER (NQUAD, ISOURCE)

C  Now set up new XSCALE to reflect re-ordering 

      CALL SETXNEW (XSCALE, IFAIL)
      IF (IFAIL.NE.0)  GO TO 100

      PRINT *,'Frequency coverage of re-ordered original spectrum'
      PRINT *
      CALL DISPLX (XSCALE,IFAIL)
      PRINT *
      PRINT *,'(centre quadrant is',IQCEN,' )'

C  If IQCEN is set to zero (as it is for GSD data) then we don't have
C  a reference channel for the LSR velocity. Use the observing defaults
C  for now - fix up later

      IF (IQCEN.EQ.0) THEN

C  Locate 'centre' channel before start of iteration

      ANCEN = FLOAT(NTOT(IQCEN-1))+0.5*(NPTS(IQCEN)+1)  ! channel to which VLSR refers
CD    PRINT *, 'Channel at original centre is ', ANCEN

C  Set up iteration by quadrant boundary

      NST2  = 1

        NST2  = NTOT(NQ)+1       ! Start and end channels of second quadrant
        NEND2 = NTOT(NQ+1)

C  Identify points involved in overlap

CD      PRINT *, 'NQ, NST1, NEND1, NST2, NEND2 ',

          IFAIL = 33
          GO TO 100                ! Tidy up and return with IFAIL set
        END IF

C       If overlap is less than 0.1 channels then snap in "wrong" direction,
C       otherwise discard an additional channel.

        N1 = NST1 + IFIX (X1+0.1) -1 ! First channel in XSCALE involved in overlap
        N2 = NST2 + IFIX (X2+0.1)    ! Last channel "

CD      PRINT *,'Overlap region channels ',N1,N2

C       Interpolate second quadrant onto sampling of first quadrant
C       using linear interpolation --- F is fraction channels to offset
C       Beware that "snap" may have pulled spectrum over by 1 channel

*       F =  X1 - IFIX(X1)                 ! Original
*       F = (X1+0.1) - IFIX(X1+0.1)        ! Even worse?
        F =  X1 - FLOAT(N1+1-NST1)         ! next try

CD      PRINT *, 'Fractional channel error = ', F

        DO J = 1, NPTS(NQ+1)-1

C  For the centre quadrant only, reflect shift of data relative
C  to sampling.

CD        PRINT *,'NQ, new CSHIFT',NQ,CSHIFT
        END IF       

C  Now find the amount by which to shift the second quadrant. Assume a simple
C  offset is all that is required. Fit the existing offset using Chi-squared
C  statistic, with parabolic weighting across overlap region (i.e., max in
C  centre and zero at ends).
C  We could of course use the actual noise on the spectrum if we knew it!

C  Find total range of overlap

        XMIN  = XSCALE(NST2+1)
        RANGE = XSCALE(NEND1)-XMIN

C  In the case where sectors may be offset from each other, estimate
C  offset, and shift spectra to suit.
