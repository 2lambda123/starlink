 TSP 2.3-2 is now available.

 v2.3-2 has various internal fixes to correct problems that caused the
 Linux version to crash when accessing components of data files.  There
 is no change to functionality and no change to the documentation (SUN/66)
 from v2.3-1.

 Please report any problems to ussc@star.rl.ac.uk.
