1 Update_to_PONGO

 Release 2.0-3
 -------------

 The on-line example figures have been re-introduced and the example
 scripts will now work when relocated.

 Recent Changes (Release 2.0-2)
 --------------

 PONGO now uses native PGPLOT for plotting rather than the deprecated 
 Starlink GKS PGPLOT. This should fix plotting and interoperability  
 problems with recent versions of KAPPA.

 Older Changes (Release 2.0-1)
 -------------

 PONGO has been considerably extended to now work from the IRAF/CL
 command language. To use this load the pongo package. The 
 commands that are available are the same as when running from ICL.
 
 Other changes of note are:

   o The READF command has been changed so that `@' is no
     longer needed when using an ICL variable to store the file name. 
     This is INCOMPATIBLE with previous behaviour and any scripts 
     using the `@' form will need changing, i.e. lines with statements
     like:

        READF DATA=('@'&FILE)

     Should be changed to:

        READF DATA=(FILE)

   o An example has been added to the panic section to show how
     PONGO can be used to plot more than 5000 points at a time (5000 is
     the current maximum number of points that can be read at the same
     time).

   o READF has been fixed so that it is possible to once again
     read data from more than one file.

   o Errors in the documentation that still included descriptions of the
     previous Chebyshev version of FITLINE have been corrected.

   o A description of how to close the edges of grids has been added to
     the GRID command section. This command now also attempts to
     complete latitude lines to their end points (this reduces 
     the ragged appearance at the ends of latitude lines).

   o The YLINEAR command now works.

   o The VP_xx commands have been modified to accept an argument which
     indicates that space around the viewport should be reserved for 
     any labels.

   o FITCURVE now uses the XMIN and XMAX parameters as described
     (polynomial curves previously used all the data). The YMAX
     and YMIN parameters are no longer used. It also now writes any
     polynomial coefficients to a file (this can be read by PLOTFUN).

   o FITCURVE has also had a memory control bug fixed.

   o CURSE now also reports approximate sky coordinates when
     reading the cursor positions.

   o A new command FILLSTY has been introduced. This conveniently sets
     the fill-style attributes (for polygons and histograms).

   o A new command DRAWPOLY has been introduced. This draws polygons
     that can be filled. 

   o A new command SETPROJ has been introduced. This sets the
     projection geometry related global variables (under CL this sets
     all the parameters of the projection aware commands).

   o The PRIM command now allows projections for all its actions (this
     also effects the commands, MOVE and DRAW). Note that the lines
     drawn are straight-lines on the plot surface, not great
     circles. The GT\_CIRCLE command already supplies this ability.

   o The commands XSCALE, YSCALE, YOFFSET and XOFFSET now allow
     negative factors.
