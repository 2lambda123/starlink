      SUBROUTINE PON_PARSE( STRING, DELIM, MAXPAR, PARS, NPAR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PON_PARSE

*  Purpose:
*     Parses a string into components.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PON_PARSE( STRING, DELIM, MAXPAR, PARS, NPAR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine takes a string and parses it into a list of words
*     which are separated by the given delimeters (each delimeter is
*     considered as a single character). The return is an array whose
*     elements are the words. Multiple occurrences of any of the
*     delimeters are skipped. The number of words which may be returned
*     is limited to MAXPAR.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The string containing the list of words.
*     DELIM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The word delimeters. Multiple occurences of any of the
*        characters in this string are considered as a word boundary.
*     MAXPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of words which can be extracted.
*     PARS( MAXPAR ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The extracted words.
*     NPAR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of words extracted.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
