      INTEGER FUNCTION INTCMD( CLIST, STRING )
*+
*  Name:
*     INTCMD

*  Purpose:
*     Compares a string against a list allowing for abbreviation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = INTCMD( CLIST, STRING )

*  Description:
*     This routine compares the characters in 'STRING' against the list
*     in 'CLIST' and returns the position in the list which agrees with
*     STRING up to as many characters as are contained in STRING.  If
*     no match can be found then INTCMD is zero on exit.  If more than
*     one match is found then the following action is taken: if the
*     value in CLIST is also ambigous then the string is assumed as
*     matching the shortest of the matching CLIST entries; otherwise if
*     the value in CLIST is not ambiguous or if the ambiguous entries
*     are identical then INTCMD is set to the negative of the first
*     entry.

*  Arguments:
*     CLIST( * ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The array of characters strings which are compared to STRING.
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The string to compare against the strings in CLIST.

*  Returned Value:
*     INTCMD = INTEGER
*        The index of the string in the CLIST array which is selected.
*        This will be 0 if no match is obtained or the negative of one
*        of the possible matches if the comparison is ambiguous.
