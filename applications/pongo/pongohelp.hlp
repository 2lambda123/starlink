0 HELP
 This is the PONGO online help system.  It invokes a HELP Facility
 to display information about a PONGO command or topic.  If you need
 assistance using this help library, enter "Using_help" in response to
 the "Topic?" prompt.

 PONGO is a set of applications for interactively plotting data.  These
 applications are written to behave in a similar way to MONGO,
 but using PGPLOT (SUN/15) as their plotting package.  PONGO
 is integrated within the STARLINK ADAM environment, meaning that
 the benefits of ICL (SUN/35) and the graphics database can be fully
 exploited.

1 Advantages
       o Data in PONGO are read from a text file using the READF
         command. Features of this command are:

            - the ability to read files which contain character
              strings as well as numeric values;

            - support for comment lines and column headings as an aid
              to remembering  what the file contains;

            - error trapping during file reading;

            - user specification of column delimiters, allowing LaTeX
              and TeX format tables to be read;

            - selective reading of the data.


       o Complicated mathematical manipulations can be performed on
         the data using  Fortran-like statements to define the
         required transformation.

       o Specialized extra data columns are provided, i.e. LABCOL,
         SYMCOL and ZCOL.

       o Many interactive cursor functions are provided.

       o Error ellipses can be drawn.

       o Vector plots can be drawn.

       o Simple statistical analysis of the data is available.

       o The data can be resampled.

       o User-specified functions defined by Fortran-like statements
         can be drawn.

       o Plots of astronomical positional data can be made in one of
         several geometries.

       o The data in the XCOL and YCOL data areas can be read as
         positions of  Right Ascension and Declination respectively,
         in the format

            HH:MM:SS.SSS   +DD:MM:SS.SSS

1 Examples
    A number of ICL procedures and associated data are provided in the
    directory $PONGO_EXAMPLES. These example procedures are intended to
    show some of the features of PONGO. All of the examples can be 
    run using the ICL command LOAD, e.g.

       PONGO> LOAD $PONGO_EXAMPLES/ppdotdiag

    and their execution can be followed if the ICL command SET TRACE
    has previously been executed.

2 SPECTRUM.ICL
    This procedure produces a plot of a  low resolution IUE spectrum
    extracted by IUEDR (SUN/37) and written using the IUEDR command
    OUTSPEC SPECTYPE=2. The output file was subsequently edited to
    make the file label lines PONGO comments and to add a line of
    PONGO column labels at the beginning of the file. IUEDR indicates
    bad or missing data in an output spectrum by attributing zero
    fluxes to the affected wavelength samples. These can be detected
    and discarded using the SELCOND parameter of the READF command:
    e.g.

       PONGO> readf $PONGO_EXAMPLES/swp3196.lap selcond="Flux > 0.0" ~
                 noall

    (where the "~" character just continues the line). In this example
    PONGO draws a polyline across all missing data flagged by IUEDR.

2 ERRORS.ICL
    The procedure ERRORS.ICL demonstrates plotting simple error bars
    using PONGO (the ERRORBAR command) and also performing simple
    statistics on the data (the FITLINE and FITCURVE commands). Note
    that a summary of the statistics is reported for each fit to the
    data.

2 HISTOGRAM.ICL
    The procedure HISTOGRAM.ICL illustrates the plotting of histograms
    with PONGO (the PLOTHIST command). This procedure also illustrates
    how the drawing of the box around the plot can be controlled
    using the BOXFRAME command.

2 PPDOTDIAG.ICL
    This procedure produces a period versus period-derivative diagram
    for pulsars. Note the use of a column within the data file to set
    the symbol number of each plotted point, and the use of the
    PONGO_NDATA global parameter for making a title containing the
    number of points that have been read in.

2 ELLIPSES.ICL
    The procedure ELLIPSES.ICL illustrates the use of the ELLIPSES
    command for plotting error ellipses.

2 PROJECTIONS.ICL
    This procedure illustrates some of the different "geometries"
    available in PONGO. It plots four different views of the
    distribution of a selection of the known pulsars in Right
    Ascension and Declination.

2 RADEC.ICL
   This procedure shows how the BOXFRAME command can be
   used to draw labels in "HH MM SS.S" & "DD MM SS.S"
   format.

2 AGI.ICL
    This procedure should be invoked from the ICL> prompt NOT from the
    PONGO> prompt (the example procedure will prompt for the name of
    an image display device). It illustrates the interaction between
    the KAPPA package (SUN/95) and PONGO via the AGI graphics
    database. Here, the image display is done using the KAPPA DISPLAY
    command and PONGO is used for all the line drawing. The IKONPAINT
    utility (SUN/71) may be used to obtain a colour hard-copy of this
    illustration.

2 VECTOR.ICL
    This procedure shows how to plot proper motion vectors. The
    sample used is a selection of bright stars with high proper motions.

1 Getting_Started
    To make the commands of PONGO available, type

       ICL> pongo

    To obtain help on any PONGO command, type

       ICL> help <command>

    To get help on PONGO type

       ICL> help pongo

    A PONGO plotting session may be begun by typing

       ICL> begplot <graphics device>

    and the PONGO session may be ended by

       PONGO> endplot

    Because the parameters PONGO uses for its commands are often
    similar to the arguments of the equivalent PGPLOT subroutines, it
    is useful be familiar with the PGPLOT manual when using PONGO.
    Note that in several cases the full descriptions of PONGO
    parameters are given only in the PGPLOT manual.


1 PONGO
    PONGO is a set of applications for interactively plotting data.
    These applications are written to behave in a similar way to MONGO
    but using PGPLOT (SUN/15) as their plotting package. PONGO
    is integrated within the STARLINK ADAM environment, meaning that
    the benefits of ICL (SUN/35) and the graphics database can be
    fully exploited.

    To make the commands of PONGO available, type

       ICL> pongo

    To obtain help on any PONGO command, type

       ICL> help <command>

    The PONGO "Classified" topic summarises the available commands, and
    "Advantages" summarises the benefits of PONGO compared with MONGO.

1 Introduction
    PONGO is a set of applications for interactively plotting data.
    These applications are written within the STARLINK ADAM environment
    using PGPLOT (SUN/15) as their plotting package.

    The advantages of using PONGO are:

       o Data in PONGO are read from a text file using the READF
         command. Features of this command are:

            - the ability to read files which contain character
              strings as well as numeric values;

            - support for comment lines and column headings as an aid
              to remembering  what the file contains;

            - error trapping during file reading;

            - user specification of column delimiters, allowing LaTeX
              and TeX format tables to be read;

            - selective reading of the data.


       o Complicated mathematical manipulations can be performed on
         the data using  Fortran-like statements to define the
         required transformation.

       o Specialized extra data columns are provided, i.e. LABCOL,
         SYMCOL and ZCOL.

       o Many interactive cursor functions are provided.

       o Error ellipses can be drawn.

       o Vector plots can be drawn.

       o Simple statistical analysis of the data is available.

       o The data can be resampled.

       o User-specified functions defined by Fortran-like statements
         can be drawn.

       o Plots of astronomical positional data can be made in one of
         several geometries.

       o The data in the XCOL and YCOL data areas can be read as
         positions of  Right Ascension and Declination respectively,
         in the format

            HH:MM:SS.SSS   +DD:MM:SS.SSS

    Because the parameters PONGO uses for its commands are often
    similar to the arguments of the equivalent PGPLOT subroutines, it
    is useful be familiar with the PGPLOT manual when using PONGO.
    Note that in several cases the full descriptions of PONGO
    parameters are given only in the PGPLOT manual.

    A PONGO plotting session may be begun by typing

       ICL> begplot <graphics device>

    and the PONGO session is be ended by

       PONGO> endplot



1 Procedures
    PONGO procedures are ICL procedures (SG/5) which make use of
    PONGO commands. ICL is a very powerful, programmable command
    language which can be used to interact between PONGO and any other
    ADAM package by means of ICL variables and the ADAM parameter
    system. To become familiar with using ICL to write PONGO
    procedures it is useful to examine the contents of the example
    procedures provided in the directory $PONGO_EXAMPLES. These
    procedures illustrate many features of PONGO, with comments to
    explain some of the more complex commands. Any line beginning "{"
    in these scripts is a comment.

1 Using_Help
 You are situated in a HELP library which contains help information
 about PONGO arranged in an hierarchical structure.  The help system
 enables you to navigate the library by prompting when it has completed
 displaying the previously requested help.

 To obtain information on a particular topic, respond to the prompt by
 typing the name of the topic and pressing the RETURN key.  You can
 abbreviate any topic name, although ambiguous abbreviations result in
 all matches being displayed.  The information displayed by the help
 system on a particular topic includes a description of the topic and
 a list of subtopics that further describe the topic.  To display
 subtopic information, type one of the subtopic names from the list in
 response to the "Subtopic?" prompt.

 You can specify percent signs (%) and asterisks (*) in the keyword as
 wild card (i.e., match all) characters.  Thus to display information
 on all available topics, type an asterisk (*) in reply to a prompt.

 To display all the information on a topic, type the topic name
 immediately followed by an ellipsis (...), e.g., BOXFRAME...
 displays information on the BOXFRAME topic as well as information on
 all the subtopics under BOXFRAME.

 You can type a question mark (?) in response to any of the prompts to
 to redisplay the most recently requested text and a list of topic or
 subtopic names.  For example, if you type ? in response to the
 "Subtopic?" prompt, a list of subtopics is displayed followed by the
 "Subtopic?" prompt.

 If you wish to move up a level in hierarchy just press RETURN in
 response to the "Subtopic?" prompt instead of typing a subtopic name,
 the "Topic?" prompt reappears,  enabling you to enter another topic
 name.  If you press RETURN in response to the "Topic?" prompt, you
 will exit from HELP.

2 Help_Parameters

 keyword ...

  Specifies one or more keywords separated by spaces that refer to the
  topic  or  subtopic on  which  you want  information  from  the help
  library.  Information  within  the help  library  is  arranged in an
  hierarchical  manner.   The levels are:

  1.  None--- If you do not specify a keyword,  HELP introduces the
      ICL help system  and lists  the top-level topics.  Each item
      in the list is a keyword in the first level of the hierarchy.

  2.  Topic-name---If you specify  a keyword  by naming  a topic,  the
      help facility  describes  the  topic.  Keywords  for  additional
      information available on this topic are listed.

  3.  Topic-name subtopic---If you  specify  a  subtopic  following  a
      topic, the help facility provides a description of the specified
      subtopic.

  Note that it is not possible to get help on PONGO without either using
  the PONGO keyword or one of the known topics (command names etc.).

   values: "NONE", "TAN", "SIN", "ARC", "GLS", "AITOFF",
   "MERCATOR" and "STG".

   This parameter is not specified on the command line. If no
   value is specified on the command line, the current value is
   used. If there is no current value, a default value "NONE" is
   used.
3 RACENTRE
RACENTRE = _CHAR (Read)
   The centre of the projection in RA (i.e. the angle must be
   specified as hh:mm:ss.sss). This parameter is only required for
   PROJECTION values other than "NONE".

   This parameter is not specified on the command line. The value
   of the global parameter PONGO_RACENTRE is used. If
   PONGO_RACENTRE is not defined, the default value "0" is used.
3 DECCENTRE
DECCENTRE = _CHAR (Read)
   The centre of the projection in declination (i.e. the angle
   must be specified as dd:mm:ss.sss). This paramerter is only
   required for PROJECTION values other than "NONE".

   This parameter is not specified on the command line. The value
   of the global parameter PONGO_DECCENTRE is used. If
   PONGO_DECCENTRE is not defined, the default value "0" is used.
3 ERSCALE
ERSCALE = _REAL (Read and Write)
   The factor used to scale values in the EXCOL and EYCOL data
   areas. This allows the ellipse axes lengths to be scaled,
   changing the sizes of ellipses produced using the FROMFILE
   parameter.

   This parameter is not specified on the command line. The value
   of the global parameter PONGO_ERSCALE is used. If
   PONGO_ERSCALE is not defined, the default value 1.0 is used.
2 Examples
PONGO> ARC 1 1 0 0
   Draw a circle of radius 1 (world coordinates), assuming the
   PASTART and PAEND parametes have their default parameters (0.0
   and 360.0 degrees respectively).
PONGO> ARC FROMDATA
   Draws arcs using the information read into the XCOL, YCOL, EXCOL
   and EYCOL data areas.

1 AVEDAT
Average the data in the XCOL and YCOL areas.

Usage:
   avedat action [nbin]

Description:

   Rebin the XCOL and YCOL data, averaging the data in each sample,
   and puts the result back into the XCOL and YCOL areas. The
   standard deviations of the averages are put into the EXCOL and
   EYCOL areas.  There are two ways in which the averaging may be
   done:

     - the data may be split into N equally sized bins over the X
       range, and the values in each bin averaged;

     - the data may be averaged in groups of N data.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 ACTION
ACTION = _CHAR (Read)
   The type of binning be used for the averaging. If "X", the
   data are divided into NBIN bins over the X range.  If "N",
   bins of varying widths with each containing NBIN data points
   are formed.

   [The value will be prompted for. It has the default "X".]
3 NBIN
NBIN = _INTEGER (Read)
   Depending upon the value of ACTION, either the number of bins
   (ACTION="X"), or the number of points per bin (ACTION="N").

   [The value will be prompted for. It has the default 10.]
3 XMIN
XMIN = _REAL (Read)
   The minimum X value to be used in the average.

   [The value of the global parameter PONGO_XMIN is used. If
   PONGO_XMIN is not defined, the default value 0.0 is used.]
3 XMAX
XMAX = _REAL (Read)
   The maximum X value to be used in the average.

   [The value of the global parameter PONGO_XMAX is used. If
   PONGO_XMAX is not defined, the default value 1.0 is used.]

1 BEGPLOT
Open a plotting device.

Usage:
   begplot [device] [action] [clear] [overlay]
      { label=?
      action

Description:

   Set up a device for subsequent PONGO plotting commands. This
   application allows plotting onto an AGI picture created by a
   different package (e.g. KAPPA), or the creation of a new base
   picture.

   If a picture created by a run of a previous application is made
   (using either the "current" picture or selecting using a known
   picture label see parameter ACTION) then it is possible to
   overlay new graphics (such as annotations, lines etc.) using the
   same coordinate system (see the OVERLAY parameter).
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 ACTION
ACTION = _CHAR (Read and Write)
   If 'B', the plotting device will be cleared and the whole of
   its plotting surface used. If equal to 'C', the current picture
   will be used and a PGPLOT viewport created inside it. If 'L'
   then a previously labelled picture (set using KAPPA:PICLABEL)
   can be selected. Once set, this parameter will retain its value
   in subsequent invocations of BEGPLOT.
   ['C']
3 CHEIGHT
CHEIGHT = _REAL (Write)
   The character height scaling factor. A value of 1.0 implies a
   nominal character height of 1/40th the viewport height. The
   value is set by the application from the height of the chosen
   picture (unless the picture is the base one). The result is
   written to the global parameter PONGO_CHEIGHT.
3 CLEAR
CLEAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE then the current picture will be cleared of any
   existing graphics.
   [TRUE]
3 DEVICE
DEVICE = DEVICE (Read and Write)
   The name of the device to be used for plotting.  The names of
   the currently available devices can be found using the INQUIRE
   DEVICES command.

   The value of the global parameter GRAPHICS_DEVICE is used
   unless a value is specified on the command line. If
   GRAPHICS_DEVICE is not defined and no value is specified on
   the command line, the value will be prompted for.
3 LABEL
LABEL = _CHAR (Read)
   If ACTION=L is selected then the name of the AGI picture to be
   selected is given by this parameter. AGI pictures can be labelled
   using the KAPPA application PICLABEL.
   ['']
3 OVERLAY
OVERLAY = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE, the PGPLOT viewport created will exactly overlay the
   the last DATA picture. This is useful for drawing axis labels
   using BOXFRAME on an image or contour map etc. that has been
   displayed by another package (e.g. KAPPA:DISPLAY).
   [FALSE]
3 XMIN
XMIN = _REAL (Write)
   The left hand edge of the world coordinate limits from the
   selected picture. This defaults to 0.0 for a new (i.e.  not
   overlayed) picture.  The result is written to the global
   parameter PONGO_XMIN.
3 XMAX
XMAX = _REAL (Write)
   The right hand edge of the world coordinate limits from the
   selected picture. This defaults to 1.0 for a new (i.e.  not
   overlayed) picture.  The result is written to the global
   parameter PONGO_XMAX.
3 YMIN
YMIN = _REAL (Write)
   The lower edge of the world coordinate limits from the
   selected picture. This defaults to 0.0 for a new (i.e.  not
   overlayed) picture.  The result is written to the global
   parameter PONGO_YMIN.
3 YMAX
YMAX = _REAL (Write)
   The lower edge of the world coordinate limits from the
   selected picture. This defaults to 1.0 for a new (i.e.  not
   overlayed) picture.  The result is written to the global
   parameter PONGO_YMAX.

1 BIN
Plot a histogram using previously binned data.

Usage:
   bin

Description:

   The data in the XCOL and YCOL data areas are used to plot a
   histogram. The data in the XCOL area specify the bin edges, while
   the data in the YCOL area specify the respective frequency for
   each bin.

   This command is a synonym for PLOTHIST B.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 CENTRE
CENTRE = _LOGICAL (Read)
   This parameter specifies whether the values in the XCOL data
   area denote the centre of each bin (when TRUE) or its lower
   edge (when FALSE).
   [FALSE]

1 BOXFRAME
Draw a frame and axes on the plot.

Usage:
   boxframe [xopt] [yopt] [xtic] [ytic] [nxsub] [nysub]

Description:

   Draw a frame, axes and tick-marks on a plot. The application has
   great flexibility in the type of axis labelling that can be
   produced -- it is essentially an interface to the PGPLOT routines
   PGBOX and PGTBOX.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 XOPT
XOPT = _CHAR (Read and Write)
   A string that controls the style of the X-axis labelling and
   tick-marks. It consists of a series of letters, which have the
   meanings shown below (reproduced from the PGPLOT manual):

      - "A" -- Draw an axis (the X axis is the horizontal line
      Y=0, the Y axis is the vertical line X=0).

      - "B" -- Draw the bottom (X) or left (Y) edge of the frame.

      - "C" -- Draw the top (X) or right (Y) edge of the frame.

      - "G" -- Draw a grid of vertical (X) or horizontal (Y)
      lines.

      - "I" -- Invert the tick-marks (i.e. draw them outside the
      viewport instead of inside).

      - "L" -- Label the axis logarithmically (see below).

      - "N" -- Write numeric labels in the conventional location
      below the viewport (X) or to the left of the viewport (Y).

      - "P" -- Extend (project) major tick-marks outside the box
      (ignored if option I is specified).

      - "M" -- Write numeric labels in the unconventional location
      above the viewport (X) or to the right of the viewport (Y).

      - "T" -- Draw major tick-marks at the major coordinate
      interval.

      - "S" -- Draw minor tick-marks (sub-ticks).

      - "V" -- Orient numeric labels vertically (this is only
      applicable to Y -- the default is to write Y-axis labels
      parallel to the axis).

      - "1" -- Force decimal labelling.

      - "2" -- Force exponential labelling.

   A set of special letters control the plotting of RA and DEC
   axes.

      - "Z" for (DD) HH MM SS.S time labelling

      - "H" means superscript numbers with d, h, m, & s  symbols

      - "D" means superscript numbers with    o, ', & '' symbols

      - "F" causes the first label (left- or bottom-most) to
            be omitted. Useful for sub-panels that abut each other.
            Care is needed because first label carries sign as well.

      - "O" means omit leading zeros in numbers < 10
            E.g.  3h 3m 1.2s rather than 03h 03m 01.2s  Useful
            to help save space on X-axes. The day field does not
            use this facility.

   Note that to use these features your data values should be in
   radians (PONGO automatically converts HH:MM:SS.SSS strings to
   radians, and the DEGTOR command from degrees to radians).

   [The global parameter PONGO_XOPT is used. If PONGO_XOPT is not
   defined, the default value "BCNST" is used.]
3 YOPT
YOPT = _CHAR (Read and Write)
   A string that controls the style of the Y-axis labelling and
   tick-marks. It consists of a series of letters, as given for
   the parameter XOPT.

   [The global parameter PONGO_YOPT is used.  If PONGO_YOPT is not
   defined, the default value "BCNST" is used.]
3 XTIC
XTIC = _REAL (Read and Write)
   The major tick-mark interval on the X-axis. If XTIC is set to
   0.0, PGPLOT makes a sensible choice.

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. The current value is initially set to 0.0.
3 YTIC
YTIC = _REAL (Read and Write)
   The major tick-mark interval on the Y-axis. If YTIC is set to
   0.0, PGPLOT makes a sensible choice.

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. The current value is initially set to 0.0.
3 NXSUB
NXSUB = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
   The number of minor tick-marks between each major tick-mark on
   the X-axis. If NXSUB is set to 0, PGPLOT makes a sensible
   choice.

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. The current value is initially set to 0.
3 NYSUB
NYSUB = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
   The number of minor tick-marks between each major tick-mark on
   the Y-axis. If NYSUB is set to 0, PGPLOT makes a sensible
   choice.

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. The current value is initially set to 0.
2 Notes
- Right Ascension and Declination axes.

   It is possible to draw RA and DEC axes using this routine. To
   do this read in your X and Y data in radians (this is the
   default if your data are stored in the HH:MM:SS.SSS,
   DD:MM:SS.SSS formats) and then set the "Z" character in the
   XOPT and YOPT parameters. A good combination of options are:

      XOPT='BCNSTZHG' YOPT='BCNSTZDG'

   For more about this (in particular how the interval options are
   set) see the PGPLOT documentation about PGTBOX. Note that the
   "Y" option is always set and that the Y axis values are
   converted into pseudo arc seconds.

1 CCMATH
Perform inter-column maths.

Usage:
   ccmath

Description:

   Perform inter-column maths (using TRANSFORM, SUN/61). The
   expressions and functions recognised have Fortran types and
   syntax.  Any construct that is legal in TRANSFORM is legal in
   this subroutine, with the additional function INDEX for filling
   the array with an increasing sequence of integers. See SUN/61 for
   further details.

   The names used for the data areas are as follows:

      - "X" -- the XCOL data area,

      - "Y" -- the YCOL data area,

      - "Z" -- the ZCOL data area,

      - "EX" -- the EXCOL error area,

      - "EY" -- the EYCOL error area.
2 Parameters

   The transformation to perform on contents of the EXCOL data
   area.

   ["EX" -- i.e. will cause the contents of the data area to
   remain unchanged.]
3 EY
EY = _CHAR (Read)
   The transformation to perform on contents of the EYCOL data
   area.

   ["EY" -- i.e. will cause the contents of the data area to
   remain unchanged.]
2 Examples
PONGO> CCMATH X=2*Y
   will fill each element of the X data area with twice the
   corresponding element of the Y data area.
2 Notes
- More than one array may be manipulated with a single command.

- The INDEX function cannot be combined with any other function.

1 CHANGE
Change plotting attributes.

Usage:
   change

Description:

   Change the PGPLOT plotting attributes: e.g. line style, pen
   colour etc. Several of the attributes can be changed at the same
   time. Each of the parameters is remembered from the last
   invocation of CHANGE: after BEGPLOT has been run, a single
   invocation of CHANGE can be used to reset the plotting attributes
   to their values the last time PONGO was used.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 ANGLE
ANGLE = _REAL (Read)
   The angle hatch lines make with horizontal, in degress.
   Only used when FILLSTY is 3.
   [45.0]
3 COLOUR
COLOUR = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
   The pen number (colour index) PGPLOT uses for plotting. The
   value should be between 0 and 255. Usually the first 16 pens
   are predefined to have the following colours:

      - 0 -- background,

      - 1 -- foreground (default),

      - 2 -- red,

      - 3 -- green,

      - 4 -- blue,

      - 10 -- green + cyan,

      - 11 -- blue + cyan,

      - 12 -- blue + magenta,

      - 13 -- red + magenta,

      - 14 -- dark grey,

      - 15 -- light grey.

   It is possible to change the colour representation of any of
   the pen colour indices using the PALETTE application.

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. The current value is intially set to 1 (i.e.
   foreground).
   [1]
3 CHEIGHT
CHEIGHT = _REAL (Read and Write)
   The character height scaling. This parameter scales the
   default character height and also alters the size of the tick
   marks and symbols that PGPLOT plots. The default character
   height in PGPLOT is about 1/40 of the viewport height.

   [The value of the global parameter PONGO_CHEIGHT is used. If
   PONGO_CHEIGHT is not defined, the default value 1.0 is used.]
3 FONT
FONT = _INTEGER (Read)
   The font used by PGPLOT. The styles for each font are as
   follows:

      - 1 -- single-stroke font (default),

      - 2 -- roman font,

      - 3 -- italic font,

      - 4 -- script font.

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. The current value is initially set to 1 (i.e.
   single-stroke font).
   [1]
3 FILLSTY
FILLSTY = _INTEGER (Read)
   The fill style used by PGPLOT. The fill styles are as follows:

      - 1 -- solid fill,

      - 2 -- hollow fill,

      - 3 -- hatched,

      - 4 -- cross-hatched

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. The current value is initially set to 2 (i.e.
   hollow fill).
   [2]
3 LINESTY
LINESTY = _INTEGER (Read)
   The line style used by PGPLOT.  The line style may be one of
   the following:

      - 1 -- full line (default),

      - 2 -- dashed,

      - 3 -- dot-dash-dot-dash,

      - 4 -- dotted,

      - 5 -- dash-dot-dot-dot.

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. The current value is initially set to 1 (i.e.
   full line).
   [1]
3 LINEWID
LINEWID = _INTEGER (Read)
   The line width scaling. This parameter scales the default line
   width.

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. The current value is initially set to 1.
   [1]
3 PHASE
PHASE = _REAL (Read)
   The fraction of SEPARATION that hatched lines are displaced.
   Modifying this between regions makes their separation more
   obvious. This is only used when FILLSTY is 3.
   [0]
3 SEPARATION
SEPARATION = _REAL (Read)
   The separation of hatched lines. The unit spacing is 1 percent
   of the smaller of the height or width of the view surface.
   Only used when FILLSTY is 3.
   [1]
3 TEXTBACK
TEXTBACK = _INTEGER (Read)
   The pen number (colour index) of the background used when
   drawing text. If less than zero then a transparent
   background is used. Zero erases the plot under the text
   region.
   [-1]
2 Examples
ICL> CHANGE RESET
   will reset the plotting attributes to their default values.

1 CLEAR
Clear plotting attributes.

Usage:
   clear

Description:

   Clear or reset various PONGO plotting attributes. Several or all
   of these plotting attributes can be specified on the command line.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 SCREEN
SCREEN = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE, the plotting surface will be cleared.
   [FALSE]
3 DATA
DATA = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE, the data arrays will be cleared. This can be useful
   if there is still unwanted data left in some of the data
   areas: for example, the READF command does not automatically
   clear columns that it does not read in. Even if the
   appropriate READF parameters have been set to 0 to inhibit
   reading error columns from the second file, the values from
   the first file will remain in the data areas. This behaviour is
   designed to allow columns to be read from separate files and
   combined in one plot. However, it can cause the automatic axis
   limit finding routines to appear to fail because of data left
   in error columns. This most commonly occurs when a file not
   containing error values is read immediately after one that
   does.
   [FALSE]
3 LIMITS
LIMITS = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE, the data limits will be cleared and the data
   re-examined in order to determine the axis limits. This
   command is often necessary if a complicated function has been
   performed on the data using the CCMATH command, because the
   current PONGO parameters may no longer be applicable to the
   data.
   [FALSE]
3 LABLST
LABLST = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE, the internal label list generated by the CURSES
   command will be cleared.
   [FALSE]
3 AGI
AGI = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE, the AGI database is cleared for the current device.
   [FALSE]
3 ERSCALE
ERSCALE = _REAL (Read)
   The scale factor by which the errors are to be multiplied.
   (Can only be set when LIMITS are cleared.)

   The value of the global parameter PONGO_ERSCALE is used. If
   PONGO_ERSCALE is not defined, the default value 1.0 is used.

1 CLOG
Take the logarithm of a column.

Usage:
   clog action

Description:

   Take the base 10 logarithm of a data column.  This application
   should be used to take the logarithm of the data columns in
   preference to doing it with CCMATH, because it can deal with the
   associated error values consistently. It automatically adds the
   "L" option to the PONGO_XOPT or PONGO_YOPT global parameters, as
   appropriate.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 ACTION
ACTION = _CHAR (Read)
   The data column to transform. It should be one of the
   following:

      - "X" -- XCOL

      - "Y" -- YCOL

      - "Z" -- ZCOL

   [The value will be prompted for.]
3 XOPT
XOPT = _CHAR (Write)
   The PGPLOT X-axis options string.  The global parameter will be
   updated to include the PGPLOT "L" axis option at the start.
   This option means that logarithmic style axis labels and tick
   marks will be plotted. The READF command will automatically
   remove any "L" characters at the start of this string since it
   assumes that they have been put there by CLOG, and fresh data
   read in will not be logarithmic. If data are naturally
   logarithmic, the "L" should be placed other than at the start
   of the string to make an "L" option that will not be modified
   by PONGO.

   It is not intended that this parameter be set by the user when
   CLOG is executed.

   The value will be written to the global parameter PONGO_XOPT.
3 YOPT
YOPT = _CHAR (Write)
   The PGPLOT Y-axis options string. Its action is similar to the
   XOPT parameter.
   It is not intended that this parameter be set by the user when
   CLOG is executed.

   The value will be written to the global parameter PONGO_YOPT.

1 CONNECT
Draw straight lines between the data points.

Usage:
   connect

Description:

   Straight line segments are drawn between the data points in the
   XCOL and YCOL data areas. This may not be used with projections
   other than "NONE"

   This command is a synonym for GPOINTS C.

1 CURSE
Use the cursor to get interactive input.

Usage:
   curse [symbol] label=?

Description:

   Display the cursor and perform various interactive tasks. These
   tasks are as follows:

      - Q -- QUIT

         The application ends.

      - D -- DRAW

         A line is drawn from the PGPLOT "current position" to  the
         cursor position. This position is also written to the
         internal label list.

      - E -- EXPAND

         The plotting limits are expanded by a factor of 2
         about the position of the cursor. No other action is taken.
         This allows the screen to be cleared and the graph to be
         re-plotted without having to set the limits explicitly.

      - G -- GRADIENT

         Draw a line between two consecutive cursor hits and report
         the gradient of the line.

      - L -- LABEL

         Write a label directly onto the plot. The application
         uses up to two points which define the angle at which the
         label is to be drawn. Once "L" has been pressed, the user
         is given the option to add another point in the standard
         PGPLOT fashion (c.f. the PGPLOT routine PGNCURSE); i.e.

            - A -- add a point

            - D -- delete a point

            - X -- finish

         On pressing the "X" key, a label is prompted for. If only
         one point is supplied, the label is plotted horizontally.

      - M -- MARK

         Mark the current cursor position with the current symbol
         type.

      - P -- ANNOTATE

         The label for the nearest data point is written with its
         left hand end at the position defined by the cursor. If "O"
         is pressed, the right hand end of the label is placed at
         that position. The information to create this label is
         stored in an internal table. This information can be
         written out into file suitable for including in an ICL
         command file by using the WRITEI application, e.g.

            PONGO> WRITEI LABLST

      - S -- SHRINK

         The plotting limits are set so as to zoom out by a factor
         of 2 about the position of the cursor. No other action is
         taken. This allows the screen to be cleared and the graph
         to be re-plotted without having to set the limits
         explicitly.

      - V -- MOVE

         The PGPLOT "current position" will be set to the cursor
         position. This position is also written to the internal
         label list.

      - X -- POSITION

         The current position of the cursor in world coordinates is
         written to the terminal and the XCURSE and YCURSE
         parameters.

      - Z -- ZOOM

         The limits for a zoomed version of the current plot are
         set. The application will prompt for two points which
         define the bottom left corner and the top right corner of
         the new graph surface.

            - A -- add a point

            - D -- delete a point

            - X -- finish

   and the polygon is drawn using an AITOFF projection. The lines
   along the edges of the polygon are drawn as suitable arcs.
2 Notes

  surface, not the sky).

1 ELLIPSES
Draw error ellipses.

Usage:
   ellipses [axes] [erscale]

Description:

   Draw error ellipses at each of the data points using values in
   the EXCOL and EYCOL error data areas, and the ZCOL data values as
   the normalized covariance. Depending upon the value of the AXES
   parameter, the major and minor axes of the ellipses will also be
   drawn.

   The size of the ellipses depends upon the parameter ERSCALE which
   should be set before the data are read in so that the WORLD
   application can calculate the viewing area properly. This allows
   the ellipse size to be varied so that it can be drawn for
   different confidence levels.

      ERSCALE   confidence
                  level
       1.00        46%

   value is used.  The current value is initially set to FALSE.
3 ERSCALE
ERSCALE = _REAL (Read and Write)
   Scale the error ellipses as described above. If the command
   WORLD DATA (which automatically sets the graph limits) is to
   work properly, the global parameter PONGO_ERSCALE should have
   been set by READF. However, if this facility is not required,
   it is perfectly acceptable to set ERSCALE when invoking
   ELLIPSES.

   [The value of the global parameter PONGO_ERSCALE is used. If
   PONGO_ERSCALE is not defined, the default value 1.0 is used.]

1 ENDPLOT
Close down the current plotting device.

Usage:
   endplot [comment]

   Close down the current plotting device, storing the current
   picture description in the AGI database. The position and world
   coordinate limits of the plot will be stored in the AGI database,
   along with any comment text.

   ENDPLOT must be executed before using a plotting application from
   another package (e.g. KAPPA) -- failure to do so will result in
   an AGI error and may corrupt the AGI database.

   This command is an ICL hidden procedure which uses the
   undocumented PONGO application ENDPONGO.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:

   values in the EXCOL and EYCOL data areas as symmetric errors
   about the point, or as an upper limit with the XCOL or YCOL data
   area holding the other limit.

   PONGO will plot error bars correctly even after logarithms of the
   data have been taken for the symmetric option, as long as the CLOG
   application has been used to perform the transformation (as
   opposed to CCMATH). For the non-symmetric case, the CCMATH
   application should be used to take the logarithms of the data
   in the EXCOL and EYCOL data areas.

3 YMIN
2 Notes
- this is the NAG-free version of this application. It fits a
general polynomial of the form:

    y = a1 + a2*x + a3*x^2 + a4*x^3 ..... an*x^n

which has order n-1, using a least squares approach. The previous
version of this routine used a Chebyshev polynomial.

- The spline fit is characterised by the positions of the knots and
the spline coefficients (and the order used for the splines) all
of which are stored in the spline file. The number of knots used
in the fit can only be influenced by using the SMOOTH
parameter. Higher values of this give larger smoothing factors. A
value of 0 gives an interpolating spline fit.

1 FITLINE
Fit a straight line to the data.

Usage:
   fitline [colour]

Description:

   If the y-axis error data are available and the WEIGHT paramter is
   TRUE, this application will perform a weighted least squares fit
   to a straight line for the data over the range delimited by the
   XMIN and XMAX parameters. If the y-axis error data are not
   available or WEIGHT is FALSE, an unweighted fit is performed. The
   best fit straight line is plotted. The resultant fit parameters
   are displayed along with some simple statistics for the data
   (these statistics are also weighted in the case of a weighted
   fit).
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 COLOUR
COLOUR = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
   The colour index used when plotting the fitted line.

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. If there is no current value, a default value of
   2 (i.e. red) is used.
3 WEIGHT
WEIGHT =_LOGICAL (Read and Write)
   Whether the fit is to use the y-axis error data in the EYCOL
   data area, if available. If no error data are available, the
   fit will always be unweighted.

   If the value is not specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. If there is no current value, a default value of
   TRUE is used.
3 XMIN
XMIN = _REAL (Read)
   The minimum X value to be used in the fit.

   The value of the global parameter PONGO_XMIN is used. If
   PONGO_XMIN is not defined, the default value 0.0 is used.
3 XMAX
XMAX = _REAL (Read)
   The maximum X value to be used in the fit.

   The value of the global parameter PONGO_XMAX is used. If
   PONGO_XMAX is not defined, the default value 1.0 is used.

1 GETPOINT
Retrieve information for a plotted data point.

Usage:
   getpoint action value

Description:

   Return the attributes of a plotted data point to ICL variables.

   This application has been written to aid the implementation of
   ICL procedures. Because it is only possible to make enquiries
   about a single point per invocation, any ICL procedure built
   around GETPOINT will work slowly if a large number of data are
   involved. For such cases it may be better to consider writing a
   customized PONGO application.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 ACTION
ACTION = _CHAR (Read)
   The method of specifying the data point in question. If "N",
   interpret the VALUE parameter as specifying the index number
   of that point. If "C",  the VALUE parameter is used to try to
   match the LABCOL entry for a point.

   [The value is prompted for.]
3 VALUE
VALUE = _CHAR (Read)
   The value to be used in the search for the data point.
   Depending upon the value of the ACTION parameter, this may
   either be an integer specifying the index number of the point
   in the data area, or a case-sensitive minimum match string for
   a label column entry in the data area.

   [The value is prompted for.]
3 X
X = _REAL (Write)
   The returned value of the X coordinate of the selected point.
3 Y

EY = _REAL (Write)
   The returned value of the Y coordinate error of the selected
   point.
3 SYMBOL
SYMBOL = _INTEGER (Write)
   The returned value of the symbol column of the selected point.
3 LABEL
LABEL = _CHAR (Write)
   The returned value of the label column of the selected point.
2 Examples
PONGO> GETPOINT C '3C45' X=(XP) Y=(YP)
   This will return the X and Y coordinates of the data point
   that has the label '3C45', if it exists, to the ICL variables
   XP and YP.

1 GPOINTS
Plot points or lines between the data.

Usage:
   gpoints action [symbol]

Description:

   General plotting application. This application can be used simply
   to plot a symbol at the position of each point, to plot a symbol
   whose size depends upon the values in the ZCOL data area, or to
   draw lines connecting the data points.
2 Parameters
For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:
3 ACTION
ACTION = _CHAR (Read)
   The type of plot to produce. This can be "C", "P" or "S",
   with the following meanings:

   - "C" (connect) -- This action simply draws straight line
   segments between the data points.

   - "P" (points) -- Draw a symbol at each of the data points. The
   symbol type that is used to mark each point is determined in
   one of 3 ways:

      o If no SYMBOL parameter is supplied on the command line,
      and no symbol numbers have been read into the symbol data
      area by READF, the point style will be set by the current
      value of SYMBOL.

      o If no SYMBOL parameter is supplied on the command line,
      and values have been read into the symbol data area by
      READF, the symbol number for each point will determine
      the style of the point plotted.

      o If SYMBOL is specified on the command line, it will
      override each of the above options. The same specified
      symbol will be used to mark all points.

   The value of the symbol index should be an integer which
   refers to the standard PGPLOT symbols.

   - "S" (sizeplot) -- This action uses the values stored in the
   ZCOL data area to determine the size of the plotted symbol.
   The value of each entry in the ZCOL data area is effectively
   used as an argument to a CHANGE CHEIGHT command before each
   point is plotted. The SCALE parameter can be used to make
   these values cover a reasonable range by multiplying the Z
   data values.

   [The value is prompted for.]
3 SYMBOL
SYMBOL = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
   The PGPLOT symbol number that is used to mark the data points.

   If a value is specified on the command line, it will be used
   for plotting symbols for all the data. If not value is
   specified on the command line, the application attempts to use
   the SYMCOL data for its symbols. If no symbol values have been
   read into the SYMCOL data area, the current value is used for
   all the data. The current value is initially set to 1.
3 SCALE
SCALE = _REAL (Read and Write)
   The scale factor used to multiply the ZCOL data values to get
   a reasonable range of symbol sizes when ACTION=SIZEPLOT.

   If no value is specified on the command line, the current
   value is used. The current value is initially set to 1.0.
3 PROJECTION

   PONGO_PROJECTN is not defined, the default value "NONE" is
   used.
3 RACENTRE

   must be specified as dd:mm:ss.sss). This parameter is only
   required for PROJECTION values other than "NONE".

   This parameter is not specified on the command line. The value
   of the global parameter PONGO_DECCENTRE is used. If

   in spherical coordinates. The intervals, start and end values
   should all be specified in degrees. The defaults for the grid
   separations normally produce desirable effects for all sky plots.
   In specifying the grid intervals it is sometimes necessary to
   take account of rounding errors that might occur, and to bear in
   mind that in some geometries a single point on the celestial
   sphere maps onto two points on the projected coordinates -- some
   care is needed to ensure that the whole grid is drawn.
2 Parameters

   of the global parameter PONGO_DECCENTRE is used. If
   PONGO_DECCENTRE is not defined, the default value "0" is used.
2 Notes
- It is sometimes necessary to specify the grid intervals in a
manner which avoids rounding errors to obtain the last grid line.
e.g 9.9999 instead of 10. You may also need to sometimes draw
the grid twice using say 30.00001 as well as 29.99999 to get
this final line.

1 Updates_to_PONGO

 The current release of PONGO is V2.0-2.

2 Changes_this_release

 PONGO now uses native PGPLOT for plotting rather than the deprecated 
 Starlink GKS PGPLOT. This should fix plotting and interoperability  
 problems with recent versions of KAPPA.
 
 Alasdair Allan (aa@astro.ex.ac.uk), 22nd April 2004.

2 Changes_in_previous_release 

 PONGO has been considerably extended to now work from the IRAF/CL
 command language. To use this load the pongo package. The 
 commands that are available are the same as when running from ICL.

 Other changes of note are:

   o The READF command has been changed so that `@' is no
     longer needed when using an ICL variable to store the file name. 
     This is INCOMPATIBLE with previous behaviour and any scripts 
     using the `@' form will need changing, i.e. lines with statements
     like:

        READF DATA=('@'&FILE)

     Should be changed to:

        READF DATA=(FILE)

   o An example has been added to the panic section to show how
     PONGO can be used to plot more than 5000 points at a time (5000 is
     the current maximum number of points that can be read at the same
     time).

   o READF has been fixed so that it is possible to once again
     read data from more than one file.

   o Errors in the documentation that still included descriptions of the
     previous Chebyshev version of FITLINE have been corrected.

   o A description of how to close the edges of grids has been added to
     the GRID command section. This command now also attempts to
     complete latitude lines to their end points (this reduces 
     the ragged appearance at the ends of latitude lines).

   o The YLINEAR command now works.

   o The VP_xx commands have been modified to accept an argument which
     indicates that space around the viewport should be reserved for 
     any labels.

   o FITCURVE now uses the XMIN and XMAX parameters as described
     (polynomial curves previously used all the data). The YMAX
     and YMIN parameters are no longer used. It also now writes any
     polynomial coefficients to a file (this can be read by PLOTFUN).

   o FITCURVE has also had a memory control bug fixed.

   o CURSE now also reports approximate sky coordinates when
     reading the cursor positions.

   o A new command FILLSTY has been introduced. This conveniently sets
     the fill-style attributes (for polygons and histograms).

   o A new command DRAWPOLY has been introduced. This draws polygons
     that can be filled. 

   o A new command SETPROJ has been introduced. This sets the
     projection geometry related global variables (under CL this sets
     all the parameters of the projection aware commands).

   o The PRIM command now allows projections for all its actions (this
     also effects the commands, MOVE and DRAW). Note that the lines
     drawn are straight-lines on the plot surface, not great
     circles. The GT\_CIRCLE command already supplies this ability.

   o The commands XSCALE, YSCALE, YOFFSET and XOFFSET now allow
     negative factors.
