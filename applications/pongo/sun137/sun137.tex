\section{Introduction}

PONGO is a set of commands for interactively plotting data stored
in ordinary text files.
It is based around the \xref{PGPLOT (SUN/15)}{sun15}{} graphics
package.

Some highlights of PONGO are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data are read from text files using a command (\cnam{\iref{READF}})
  that has:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the ability to read files which contain character strings as well as
    numeric values;
  \item support for comment lines and column headings as an aid to remembering
    what the file contains;
  \item variable column delimiters, allowing \LaTeX\ and \TeX\
    format tables to be read;
  \item selective reading of the data;
  \item the ability to read in positions of Right Ascension and
    Declination in the format
    \begin{quote}
\begin{terminalv}
HH:MM:SS.SSS   +DD:MM:SS.SSS
\end{terminalv}
    \end{quote}
  \end{itemize}
\item Plots of astronomical positional data can be made in one of several
  geometries (TAN, SIN, ARC, GLS, AITOFF, MERCATOR and STG).

\item Complicated mathematical manipulations can be performed on the data
  using  Fortran-like statements to define the required transformation.
\item Specialised extra data columns are provided, \ie \labcol\ for
  labels, \symcol\ for symbol numbers and \excol/\eycol\ for errors.
\item Many interactive cursor functions are provided.
\item Error ellipses can be drawn.
\item Vector plots can be drawn.
\item Simple statistical analysis of the data is available.
\item The data can be resampled.
\item Functions defined by Fortran-like statements can be drawn.
\end{itemize}

PONGO can used from both the Starlink/ICL and IRAF/CL
\footnote{at the time of writing IRAF support is no longer available
in a standard release} command languages and integrates with other Starlink
software packages.

Because the parameters PONGO uses for its commands are often similar
to the arguments of the equivalent PGPLOT subroutines, it is useful to
read the PGPLOT manual in conjunction with this user guide (if you are
not already familiar with PGPLOT).
In several cases the full descriptions of the parameters are given
only in the PGPLOT manual.

\section{Starlink/ICL or IRAF/CL?}
PONGO needs a command-language as a host environment and at present it
can be used from two that are generally available to astronomers; the
Starlink Interactive Command Language (ICL) and the IRAF Command
Language (CL).  You should use PONGO from which ever language is most
natural (\ie the one you or your colleagues are most familiar
with). There are no significant advantages to either system, however,
people intending to use IRAF/CL should note that most of this document
is slanted towards ICL usage (the original ``home'' of PONGO) and
should be prepared to consult the on-line help system, which should be
more IRAF specific.

Under IRAF/CL PONGO is available as the \verb+pongo+ package. From ICL
PONGO is available by just typing the \verb+pongo+ command.

\section{Tutorial Examples}
The following two sections show the same simple example. The first
uses the Starlink/ICL and the second the IRAF/CL command
languages.

\subsection{An ICL example}

In order to start PONGO you must first start ICL. This may be done by typing:
\begin{terminalv}
% pongo
\end{terminalv}
at C-shell the prompt. Or alternatively by starting ICL then using the
\verb+pongo+ command.

In any PONGO session the first action is to open the plotting device.
This is done by typing\footnote{ If you have already used PONGO then
you should also issue the \cnam{\iref{RESETPONGO}} command immediately
after \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}}.}:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> begplot xw
\end{terminalv}

Where `\verb+xw+' should be replaced by the name of the plotting device you
are intending to use.  Note that once you have begun a PONGO session
with the \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}} command, the \verb+ICL>+ prompt changes
to \verb+PONGO>+. This is important because the only commands you can
use with success at the \verb+ICL>+ prompt are \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}}
and \cnam{\iref{DEVICE}}, all other commands should be typed at the
\verb+PONGO>+ prompt. The data may then be read using the
command \footnote{Note that the data file name is given as
\texttt{(TUTORIAL\_DATA)}, this uses an ICL variable which is set up
when PONGO is initialised}. Normally an `ordinary' file name would be
used \ie \texttt{spectrum.dat}. An ICL variable is used here as it is
not possible at this time to use an environment variable for accessing
formatted files. The actual file is
\texttt{\$PONGO\_EXAMPLES/tutorial.dat}:

\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> readf data=(TUTORIAL_DATA) xcol=1 ycol=3 all
\end{terminalv}
Plotting limits are set up using the range of the data by the command:
\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> dlimits
\end{terminalv}
Axes for the plot may be drawn using:
\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> boxframe
\end{terminalv}
and finally the points may be plotted as asterisk-like symbols and the axes
labelled with:
\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> points 3
PONGO> label 'X axis' 'Y axis' 'Plot Title'
\end{terminalv}
Note that the data values are remembered by PONGO and the plot you have
just created may be erased and recreated by typing:
\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> advance
PONGO> boxframe
PONGO> points
PONGO> label
\end{terminalv}
To close a device and end a PONGO plot the command
\cnam{\iref{ENDPLOT}} should be used.  This is important if you are
going to switch to another set of applications such as
\xref{KAPPA}{sun95}{}, otherwise the plotting device characteristics
will be inaccessible to the second package.

\subsection{A CL example}

In order to start PONGO you must first start CL and load the
\verb+pongo+ package.

In any PONGO session the first action is to open the plotting device.
This is done by typing\footnote{ If you have already used PONGO then
you should also issue the \cnam{\iref{RESETPONGO}} command immediately
after \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}}.}:
\begin{terminalv}
po> begplot xw
\end{terminalv}
Where `\verb+xw+' should be replaced by the name of the plotting device you
are intending to use. The data may then be read using the command:
\begin{terminalv}
po> readf data=pongoexamples$tutorial.dat xcol=1 ycol=3 all=yes
\end{terminalv}
Plotting limits are set up using the range of the data by the command:
\begin{terminalv}
po> dlimits
\end{terminalv}
Axes for the plot may be drawn using:
\begin{terminalv}
po> boxframe
\end{terminalv}
and finally the points may be plotted as asterisk-like symbols and the axes
labelled with:
\begin{terminalv}
po> points 3
po> label "X axis" "Y axis" "Plot Title"
\end{terminalv}
To close a device and end a PONGO plot the command:
\cnam{\iref{ENDPLOT}} should be used.

\section{Classified List of Commands}

This section presents a list of the available PONGO commands,
classified into several broad categories: commands which begin and end
a PONGO session, commands for manipulating data, commands which
control plotting, plotting commands, and commands which perform simple
statistics on the data.  Not all the commands given are individual
applications, many are synonyms (or scripts) for other applications
with specific parameters provided for convenience.  Detailed
descriptions of these commands are given in Appendix \ref{defn_sect}.
The parts of the command names outside parentheses define the minimum
abbreviation for that application (IRAF users should note that CL uses
its own abbreviations, which may not correspond to those below).

\section{Data File Formats} \label{data_sect}

The simplest form of input file for PONGO is a text file with the data
in columns separated by spaces, as in the file
\verb+$PONGO_EXAMPLES/tutorial.dat+ (or \verb+pongoexamples$tutorial.dat+).
However, PONGO allows a considerable level of fine control over the
data used for plotting from a particular file by providing for the use
of column delimiters, column labels and comments in data files.

\subsection{Column delimiters}

The default column delimiter is a space character, although the
\cnam{\iref{READF}} command does have the ability to use other
delimiters by setting the \pnam{DELIM} parameter.  It is possible for
more than one delimiter character to be used, \eg using \verb+&\+
would be a good way to read a table that was in \TeX\ format (\verb+&+
for a \LaTeX\ tabular format table).  A null string for the
\pnam{DELIM} parameter has the same effect as a single space.


\subsection{Column labels}

It is possible to give each column in a file a symbolic name that can be used
to reference the column when reading the file and can be automatically
transferred to the appropriate axis label on the plot.
To do this, the first line of the file should be of the form:
\begin{terminalv}
!$label 1$label 2$label 3$
\end{terminalv}
where there are as many labels, each delimited by a \verb+$+, as there are
columns.
Care should be taken to ensure that there is no leading white space in the
column labels, although it is permissible for the column labels to contain
white space elsewhere.
Any padding that is required to make the column labels line up with the data
columns should be achieved with multiple dollar signs,
\eg:
\begin{terminalv}
!$RA$$$$Declination$
\end{terminalv}
When specifying the column on the command line, \eg \cnam{YCOL Dec},
it is permissible to abbreviate the string to a minimum match.
However, \emph{the match is case-sensitive.}


\subsection{Comments}

Comments may be placed in the data file by prefixing the line with one
of the standard comment characters.  There are two comment characters
allowed in the data file, specified by the parameters \pnam{HARDCOMM}
and \pnam{SOFTCOM} for the command \cnam{\iref{READF}}.  These comment
characters must occur in the first column of a line to be recognised
as comment characters.  The main purpose of comment characters is to
document data files and to comment out unwanted lines of data.  The
existence of two comment characters provides the ability to
selectively read data subsets from files.  Blank lines are ignored in
data files.

Although not recommended practice, the documentation of data files can
be done without the use of comment characters: because PONGO will
reject any line in which the required numerical column cannot be
interpreted as a valid number, it does not matter whether a comment
character is put at the start of the line or not.


\subsection{Astronomical coordinates}

It is possible to read data stored in an astronomical coordinate
format (\ie \verb+HH:MM:SS.SSS+ and \verb+DD:MM:SS.SSS+) into PONGO.
The data is stored internally in \emph{radians}: in this conversion any data
read into \xcol\ is assumed to be a Right Ascension (\ie of the first
form above) and any data read into \ycol\ is assumed to be a
Declination (\ie of the second form above).

The \cnam{\iref{BOXFRAME}} command can label axes using a
\verb+HH MM SS.S+ and \verb+DD MM SS.S+ format providing the data and frame limits
are specified in radians.

\section{Internal Data Areas}

There are seven internal data areas into which data may be read.
These are as follows:

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item [\xcol] -- This area is principally intended to hold X-axis
data.  However, when using the command \cnam{\iref{PLOTHIST} H}, this
area is intended to hold the data before they are binned to draw the
histogram.

When using the command \cnam{\iref{ERRORBAR} X} with the symmetric
option turned off, this area contains the position of one of the ends
of the error bar.

\item [\ycol] -- This area is intended to hold Y-axis data.

When using the command \cnam{\iref{ERRORBAR} Y} with the symmetric
option turned off, this area contains the position of one of the ends
of the error bar.

\item [\excol] -- This area is principally intended to hold errors for the
X-axis data values.
These errors are generally assumed to be symmetric about the data point
by the command \cnam{\iref{ERRORBAR}}, but with the symmetric option turned off
\excol\ holds the position of the opposite end of the error bar to
\xcol.

The \excol\ area is assumed to contain the standard error of the \xcol\ data by
the command \cnam{\iref{ELLIPSES}}.

The \excol\ area is also used to hold the X-axis component of the
vector offset from the data point by the command \cnam{\iref{VECT}},
and the proper motion in Right Ascension by the command
\cnam{\iref{PVECT}}.

When using the command \cnam{\iref{ARC}}, the \excol\ data are assumed
to contain the magnitude of the semi-major axis of the ellipse.

The command \cnam{\iref{AVEDAT}} will write the standard deviation of
the average it calculated for each bin into the \excol\ data area.

\item [\eycol] -- Similar to \excol, but applying to the Y-axis data values.

The \eycol\ area is used to hold the Y-axis component of the vector
offset from the data point by the command \cnam{\iref{VECT}}, and the
proper motion in Declination by the command \cnam{\iref{PVECT}}.

When using the command \cnam{\iref{ARC}}, the \eycol\ data are assumed
to contain the magnitude of the semi-minor axis of the ellipse.

\item [\zcol] -- PONGO does not have the ability to draw three
dimensional plots.
As a result, the \zcol\ data area does not contain Z-axis data in the
conventional sense.
However, there are a number of commands that use the values stored in the
\zcol\ area.

The command \cnam{\iref{SIZEPLOT}} uses the values stored in \zcol\ to
scale the size of the marker symbols plotted for each data point.

The commands \cnam{\iref{VECT}} and \cnam{\iref{PVECT}} can optionally
use the values in \zcol\ to scale the length of the vectors they draw.

The command \cnam{\iref{ELLIPSES}} assumes that \zcol\ contains the
values of the normalised covariances between the X- and Y-axis errors.

\item [\labcol] This area is used for storing a character string
associated with each of the data points.  The strings may be plotted
interactively using the \cnam{\iref{ANNOTATE}} or \cnam{\iref{CURSE}}
commands.

\item [\symcol] This area is used to store a PGPLOT symbol number (an
\verb+INTEGER+) associated with each of the data points.

% Note that this symbol number is not restricted to the 32 specified as
% markers in the PGPLOT manual, any of the Hershey character numbers can
% be used as well.
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\section{Projections} \label{proj_sect}

PONGO is capable of plotting astronomical coordinate data in one of several
`projections' or, more strictly, in one of several geometries (not all of the
`projections' are true projections onto a plane, but are geometries that have
other properties -- \eg the equal area property where areas are preserved in
the transformation from the celestial sphere to a two dimensional plot).
\emph{Table \ref{proj_tab}} lists the geometries available in PONGO.

All the main point plotting commands will work in any of the available
geometries.
They assume that the data in the \xcol\ and \ycol\ areas are stored internally
in radians and refer to the longitude and latitude respectively of the point to
be plotted.
Where the position values are to be entered on the command line, the latitude
and longitude are normally given in degrees.

In addition to the point plotting commands, there are also three commands whose
only use is when plotting in a particular projection type:

\begin {quote}
\begin{description}
\item [\iref{GRID}] -- Plot a coordinate grid in the current projection.
                       The default parameters of this command are to draw a
                       grid over the whole sky with a longitude line every 30
                       degrees and a latitude line every 10 degrees.
\item [\iref{GT\_CIRCLE}] -- Draw a great circle between two specified points
                             on the celestial sphere.
\item [\iref{PVECT}] -- Draw proper motion vectors from each plotted point as
                        small great circle arcs.
\end{description}
\end {quote}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{0.6\textwidth}|}
\hline
Projection & Description \\
\hline
NONE     & No projection is used. \\
AITOFF   & The Aitoff projection (has an equal area property). \\
ARC      & Move an equal distance on the tangent plane as a great circle on the
celestial sphere. \\

\section{Creating Complex Plots}

Repeating complex sequences of PONGO commands by hand can become
boring and is likely to lead to many mistakes (particularly on those
occasions when you want to create a hardcopy and cannot even see the
current state). The way to get around these problems is to use the
abilities of the ICL or CL command languages to create \emph{procedures}.

The following two sections show extremely simple examples of how to
start doing this in both languages. To get further you'll need to
consult the appropriate documentation, \xref{SG/5}{sg5}{} in the case
of ICL and the ``\emph{CL Programmer's Manual}'' and
``\emph{An Introductory User's Guide to IRAF Scripts}'' for CL.

\subsection{A simple ICL procedure}

A simple procedure that reproduces the tutorial example looks like:
\begin{terminalv}
proc icltest file
   begplot xw
   readf data=(file) xcol=1 ycol=3 all reset
   dlimits
   boxframe
   points 3
   label 'X axis' 'Y axis' 'PLOT TITLE'
   endplot
endproc
\end{terminalv}
If you enter this text into a file say called \verb+icltest.icl+ and use
the following commands from ICL:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL > load icltest
ICL > icltest (TUTORIAL_DATA)
\end{terminalv}
The data from the tutorial example will be plotted as before. One
immediate advantage of this method is that we can now plot data from
columns 1 and 3 of any file.

If the contents of the procedure are wrong or need a slight
modification then you can edit the procedure from ICL. Try the command:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL > edit icltest
\end{terminalv}
This puts you into an editor and you can modify the procedure. (If you
haven't set an environment variable EDITOR or used the ICL command
\verb+set editor+, you'll find yourself in \verb+vi+. To exit from this
type the command \verb+:q+ and now use the \verb+set editor+
command.) If you made a modification to the procedure this can be
viewed using the command:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL > list icltest
\end{terminalv}
All the currently available procedures are shown using the command:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL > procs
\end{terminalv}
If you do modify a procedure from ICL use the:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL > save icltest
\end{terminalv}
command to write out your changes (you should use the name of your procedure
instead of \verb+icltest+).

\subsection{A simple CL procedure}

A simple CL procedure that reproduces the tutorial example looks like:
\begin{terminalv}
procedure cltest (datafile)
string datafile
begin
   begplot xw
   readf (data=datafile, xcol=1, ycol=3, all=yes, mode=h )
   dlimits
   boxframe
   points 3
   label ("X axis", "Y axis", "PLOT TITLE")
   endplot
end
\end{terminalv}
If you enter this text into a file say called \verb+cltest.cl+ and use
the following commands from CL.
\begin{terminalv}
po> task cltest = cltest.cl
po> cltest pongoexamples$tutorial.dat
\end{terminalv}
The data from the tutorial example will be plotted as before. One
immediate advantange of this method is that we can now plot data from
columns 1 and 3 of any file.

Another way in which you can create CL scripts is to use the
\verb+mkscript+ command.

\subsection{Example procedures} \label{exam_sect}

These examples are intended to show some of the features of PONGO and
also provide examples of complex procedures for both the ICL and CL
command-languages. All these procedures can be
found in the directories \verb+$PONGO_EXAMPLES+  and
\verb+pongoexamples$+ respectively. ICL examples have file extensions
\verb+.icl+ and CL examples \verb+.cl+.

The ICL procedures will prompt for a graphics device and should be
invoked from the \verb+ICL>+ prompt using the ICL command \verb+load+, \eg:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> load $PONGO_EXAMPLES/ppdotdiag
\end{terminalv}
and their execution can be followed if the ICL command \verb+set trace+ has
previously been executed.

The CL procedures are defined as tasks by the \verb+pongo+ command and
can be run by just typing their name \ie:
\begin{terminalv}
po> ppdotdiag
\end{terminalv}

Note that some of the examples involve the colour representation of lines,
which may be difficult to see on a greyscale device (\eg on a monochrome
Postscript device).
It is recommended that a colour image display device is used to run the
example procedures.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Spectrum}

This procedure produces \emph{Figure \ref{fig:SPECTRUM}}, a plot of a
low resolution
IUE spectrum extracted by \xref{IUEDR (SUN/37)}{sun37}{} and written using the
IUEDR command \verb+OUTSPEC SPECTYPE=2+.
The output file was subsequently edited to make the file label lines PONGO
comments and to add a line of PONGO column labels (see \S\ref{data_sect})
at the beginning of the file.
IUEDR indicates bad or missing data in an output spectrum by attributing zero
fluxes to the affected wavelength samples.
These can be detected and discarded using the \pnam{SELCOND} parameter of
the \cnam{\iref{READF}} command: \eg

\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> readf (SWP_DATA) selcond="Flux > 0.0" noall
\end{terminalv}

In this example PONGO draws a polyline across all missing data flagged by
IUEDR.

\newpage


\subsubsection{Errors}

The procedure \verb+ERRORS+ was used to plot \emph{Figure
\ref{fig:ERRORS}}.  This example demonstrates plotting simple error
bars using PONGO (the \cnam{\iref{ERRORBAR}} command) and also
performing simple statistics on the data (the \cnam{\iref{FITLINE}}
and \cnam{\iref{FITCURVE}} commands).  Note that a summary of the
statistics is reported for each fit to the data.

\myfig{sun137_fig2}{[htbp]}{width=0.9\textwidth}{fig:ERRORS}{ERRORS example.}{ERRORS example.}
\newpage


\subsubsection{Histogram}

The procedure \verb+HISTOGRAM+ (\verb+histogramtest+ from CL) was used to
plot \emph{Figure \ref{fig:HISTOGRAM}}, which illustrates the plotting
of histograms with PONGO (the \cnam{\iref{PLOTHIST}} command).  This
procedure also illustrates how the drawing of the box around the plot
can be controlled using the \cnam{\iref{BOXFRAME}} command.

\myfig{sun137_fig3}{[htbp]}{width=0.9\textwidth}{fig:HISTOGRAM}{HISTOGRAM example.}{HISTOGRAM example.}
\newpage


\subsubsection{Ppdotdiag}

This procedure produces \emph{Figure \ref{fig:PPDOTDIAG}}, a period
versus period derivative diagram for pulsars.  Note the use of a
column within the data file to set the symbol number of each plotted
point, and the use of the \verb+PONGO_NDATA+ global parameter for
making a title containing the number of points that have been read in
(in CL this uses the output parameter \verb+readf.ndata+)

\myfig{sun137_fig4}{[htbp]}{width=0.9\textwidth}{fig:PPDOTDIAG}{PPDOTDIAG example.}{PPDOTDIAG example.}
\newpage


\subsubsection{Ellipses}

The procedure \verb+ELLIPSES+ (\verb+ellipsetest+ from CL) was used to plot
\emph{Figure \ref{fig:ELLIPSES}}, which illustrates the use of the
\cnam{\iref{ELLIPSES}} command for plotting error ellipses.

\myfig{sun137_fig5}{[htbp]}{width=\textwidth}{fig:ELLIPSES}{ELLIPSES example.}{ELLIPSES example.}
\newpage


\subsubsection{Projections}

This procedure illustrates some of the different `geometries'
available in PONGO.  It plots four different views of the distribution
of a selection of the known pulsars in Right Ascension and Declination
to produce \emph{Figure \ref{fig:PROJECTIONS}}.

\myfig{sun137_fig6}{[htbp]}{width=0.9\textwidth}{fig:PROJECTIONS}{PROJECTIONS example.}{PROJECTIONS example.}
\newpage

\subsubsection{Radec}

This procedure shows how the \cnam{\iref{BOXFRAME}} command can be
used to draw labels in \verb+HH MM SS.S+ \& \verb+DD MM SS.S+
format.
The output from it is shown in \emph{Figure \ref{fig:RADEC}}.
The objects are some of the pulsars from
\emph{Figures \ref{fig:PROJECTIONS}} and \emph{\ref{fig:PPDOTDIAG}}.

\myfig{sun137_fig7}{[htbp]}{width=0.9\textwidth}{fig:RADEC}{RADEC example.}{RADEC example.}
\newpage

\subsubsection{Vector}
This procedure shows the \cnam{\iref{VECT}} and \cnam{\iref{PVECT}}
commands being used to plot the proper motion vectors of a set of
bright stars. The stars are selected to have proper motions in
RA greater than 0.5 arcseconds and the distances shown correspond to
100000 years of travel.

\myfig{sun137_fig9}{[htbp]}{width=0.9\textwidth}{fig:VECTOR}{VECTOR example.}{VECTOR example.}
\newpage

\subsubsection{Interactive}

After executing the examples it is a good idea to gain some
experience with the \cnam{\iref{CURSE}} application.  This can be done
using the procedure \verb+INTERACTIVE+.  The procedure will plot a
graph and then invoke the \cnam{\iref{CURSE}} application, resulting
in the following instructions being printed on the screen:
\begin{terminalv}
CURSE cursor options:
   Q - Quit.
   D - Draw to the cursor position.
   E - Expand the plotting limits.
   G - Calculate the gradient.
   L - Label the plot.
   M - Mark a point.
   O - Left justified annotation.
   P - Right justified annotation.
   S - Shrink the plotting limits.
   V - Move to the cursor position.
   X - Get the cursor position.
   Z - Zoom the plotting limits.
\end{terminalv}
where the letter signifies the key that is to be pressed on the keyboard to
achieve the desired effect.

If you have examined the example file for \verb+INTERACTIVE+ you will
have seen that a label has been read in for each of the data points.
It is now possible for you to use these labels by moving the cursor close to a
plotted point and pressing \verb+O+ or \verb+P+.
When you do this, a label for the point nearest the cursor will be written at
the cursor position.
Do this for several points and then press \verb+Q+ to exit from the
\cnam{\iref{CURSE}} command.
PONGO will have remembered the particular labelling that that you have
performed and will then use the command \cnam{\iref{WRITEI} LABLST=YES} to
write the PONGO commands required to recreate these labels to a
specified file.  (You can use the procedure \verb+INTERACTIVE+ to
explore the other functions of the \cnam{\iref{CURSE}} application.)

The \zcol\ area has been filled with the distances to each of the
pulsars.
These values can be used to plot points whose sizes are inversely proportional
to distance (\ie the closer pulsars are larger) by first taking the reciprocal
of the \zcol\ area with the \cnam{\iref{CCMATH}} command:
\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> CCMATH Z=1/(Z+0.1)
\end{terminalv}
and then the points plotted with the command:
\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> SIZEPLOT
\end{terminalv}
Note here that a small positive value has been added to the distance data
(\ie \texttt{Z+0.1}) to avoid very large symbols for nearby pulsars.


\newpage
\subsubsection{AGI}

This example illustrates the interaction between the \xref{KAPPA
package (SUN/95)}{sun95}{} and PONGO via the \xref{AGI graphics
database}{sun48}{}.  Here, the image display has been done using the
\xref{KAPPA \cnam{DISPLAY}}{sun95}{DISPLAY} command and PONGO has been
used for all the line drawing (note this example is not available
under CL).

\section{Using PONGO with other Starlink Applications}

Using graphics between different applications packages is often difficult
because once one package has finished plotting and completed execution all
information concerning the contents of the plot is lost.
This problem may be overcome by storing relevant graphical information for the
plot (\eg the graphics device, the size and position of the plot on the display
surface, the coordinate limits of the data) in a file and providing facilities
to store and retrieve the information in this database.
This allows different applications to be used to display images, draw contours
and  annotate, for example, on the same plot without each application losing
access to the plot dimensions.
One such facility is provided by Starlink and is called
\xref{AGI -- Applications Graphics Interface (SUN/48)}{sun48}{}.
As its name implies, this facility provides a means by which any application
can store plotting information for later use and retrieve plotting information
stored by previous applications.
To use AGI to good effect requires familiarity with some nomenclature.

AGI divides the plotting surface up into \textbf{pictures}, where a picture
represents a rectangular area on the display surface.
AGI stores coordinate information for each picture it creates on a graphics
device in its database.
AGI pictures are independent of the graphics package used to plot the data
(where supported; \ie SGS, IDI or PGPLOT), but they do depend explicitly upon
the graphics device used to plot the data.
AGI stores each picture in its database, grouped by the graphics device (or
\textbf{workstation} in Starlink graphics terminology) upon which the picture was
created, and each is stored sequentially in the order in which they were
created.
AGI pictures are given a name which indicates their use:
a \textbf{BASE} picture refers to the whole plotting surface and the name is
reserved only for this use;
a \textbf{FRAME} picture refers to a picture which contains other pictures;
and a \textbf{DATA} picture refers to a picture which contains a plot of the data.
AGI also stores a label for each picture: a short character string which
can be used by an application to uniquely identify a picture.
Finally, AGI can store a one-line comment for each picture in the database to
describe its use.

PONGO uses the definitions of \textbf{world coordinates}, \textbf{window},
\textbf{device coordinates} and \textbf{viewport} used by the
\xref{PGPLOT graphics package (SUN/15)}{sun15}{} upon which it is based.
Here, a PONGO plot represents a window of given size in the data or world
coordinates the you're working in.
The data are plotted within these world coordinate limits in a rectangular
area of the workstation surface.
This area is called the viewport and its size and shape are defined in terms of
the device coordinates.
The data are plotted exactly within this viewport and so plot annotation and
labelling will normally extend beyond the viewport limits.
AGI pictures refer directly to PONGO viewports.
Clearly, not all viewports used by PONGO will be associated with data windows
and refer to plotted data; many will just define regions of the workstation
surface in which further viewports will be defined.
These viewports are directly analogous to the AGI FRAME pictures and are
stored as such by AGI.
Those viewports which are used for plotting data within are directly analogous
to AGI DATA pictures and again are stored as such by AGI.

By default, when \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}} (or \cnam{\iref{DEVICE}}) is used to
begin a new PONGO plotting session; \eg:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> begplot xw
\end{terminalv}
PONGO will open the device and use the AGI BASE picture for that device, unless
there is a more recent picture.
In the case of a more recent picture, a FRAME picture will be created with the
dimensions of the picture current on entry.
In either case, the workstation will also be cleared.
When a PONGO plot ends, using \cnam{\iref{ENDPLOT}}, the AGI picture current on entry
is again made current.

There are two further modes in which a PONGO plot may be begun: assert
that PONGO use the BASE picture for plotting (\cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT} ACTION=B});
and assert that PONGO use the last DATA picture in the
current FRAME, without clearing the graphics device (\cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}
OVERLAY NOCLEAR}).  Specifying \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT} ACTION=B} forces PONGO to
make the AGI BASE picture current on entry; \ie if you specifically
want to use the whole display surface for plotting.
Using \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT} OVERLAY=YES CLEAR=NO} allows plotting with other
applications packages in a coordinated way.  Here, PONGO will search
for the last DATA picture in the AGI database and use the associated
coordinates to define the PGPLOT viewport.  The workstation will not
be cleared on entry.  This means that anything plotted with PONGO will
be on the same axes and to the same scale as the existing plot.

As an example, PONGO can be used to annotate images displayed using
\xref{KAPPA}{sun95}{}.  First, KAPPA will be used to set the image
display device and to clear the AGI database for the device (\ie a
tidy start):
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> kappa
ICL> idset xw
ICL> idclear
\end{terminalv}
It is necessary to first define the viewport the image is to be plotted within
using PONGO in order to assure that there is enough room around the image for
the annotation (remember, the annotation of PONGO graphs normally lies outside
the viewport):
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> pongo
ICL> begplot xw
PONGO> vstand
PONGO> endplot
\end{terminalv}
Then use \xref{KAPPA}{sun95}{DISPLAY} to display the
image\footnote{The image actually displayed is defined, in this case,
by the ICL variable \texttt{DOR\_DATA}. This is set to the value
\texttt{\$PONGO\_EXAMPLES/dor} when PONGO is started.}:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> picdata
ICL> display (DOR_DATA) mode=perc percentiles=[3,99.9]
ICL> lutheat
\end{terminalv}
Here, \xref{KAPPA PICDATA}{sun95}{PICDATA} is used to select the last
defined AGI DATA picture, which is a DATA picture created by PONGO
with enough space around it to annotate the plot. You could also use
\xref{KAPPA PICLIST}{sun95}{PICLIST} which shows a table of all the
pictures in the AGI database.  These include the BASE picture,
referring to the entire plotting surface of the graphics device;
the PONGO FRAME picture, defined on entry and again referring to the
entire plotting surface; and finally the PONGO DATA picture, referring
the area of the plotting surface within which the image is displayed.

Now PONGO may be used to annotate the plot:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> begplot xw overlay noclear
PONGO> boxframe bcinst bcinst
PONGO> label "X-axis pixel" "Y-axis pixel" "KAPPA image"
PONGO> endplot
\end{terminalv}
The image has been displayed by \xref{KAPPA}{sun95}{} and then the
axes drawn and annotated using PONGO.  In this case, the annotation
represents the pixel number in each of the axes of the image.  A more
detailed example of the interaction between \xref{KAPPA}{sun95}{} and
PONGO, via \xref{AGI}{sun48}{}, is provided in \S\ref{exam_sect}.

\section{Panic Section}

\subsection{Getting help in ICL}

When in ICL, on-line help on PONGO may be examined using the command:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> help pongo
\end{terminalv}
This will provide a brief description of the package and how to begin and end a
PONGO plotting session.
Once the PONGO commands have been made available within ICL, \ie by typing
\begin{terminalv}
%  pongo
\end{terminalv}
at the C-shell prompt or:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> pongo
\end{terminalv}
at the \verb+ICL>+ prompt, on-line help on any PONGO command may be examined
using the command:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> help <pongo command>
\end{terminalv}
The command:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> help pongo
\end{terminalv}
will produce a brief introduction to PONGO, and the command:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> help introduction
\end{terminalv}
will produce a more detailed introduction to PONGO and how to get
started.  These help commands are also available at the \verb+PONGO>+
prompt.  A classified list of PONGO applications (\cnam{HELP
CLASSIFIED}) is provided within the help system and help is also
provided on running the PONGO examples (\cnam{HELP EXAMPLES}).

If difficulties are encountered with PONGO and the on-line help system
does not reveal the cause, it is recommended that the relevant
sections of this document are read, or re-read.  It may be that this
document does not provide enough detail concerning the behaviour of
the PGPLOT graphics package: for detailed information regarding
PGPLOT, the PGPLOT manual should be consulted (available as a
Miscellaneous User Document, MUD, at all Starlink sites).  As a last
resort, the problem may be regarded as a software bug and reported to
the Starlink Software support mailing list (starlink@jiscmail.ac.uk).


\subsection{\cnam{BEGPLOT} or \cnam{DEVICE} does not work in ICL}

If the error message:
\begin{terminalv}
TOOFEWPARS   Not enough procedure parameters
\end{terminalv}
is returned after the \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}} or \cnam{\iref{ENDPLOT}}
commands have been invoked, the reason is that another application
package or ICL procedure has switched parameter checking on within ICL
\xref{(SG/5)}{sg5}{}.  The problem is simply overcome by typing the command:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> set nocheckpars
\end{terminalv}
The PONGO commands will then work correctly.

\subsection{\cnam{READF} cannot find a column label}

If a column label is used with the \cnam{\iref{READF}} command instead
of the column number (see \S\ref{data_sect}) and \cnam{\iref{READF}}
fails, \eg:
\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> readf myfile.dat xcol=1 ycol=3 zcol="ZCOL"
File: /disk/scratch/jbloggs/plots/myfile.dat
XCOL - 1 is column number 1.
YCOL - 3 is column number 3.
!! ZCOL incorrectly specified as ZCOL.
!  READF: Data could not be read.
\end{terminalv}
then either the data file does not have column labels or the incorrect
column label has been used.
It is of particular significance here that the column labels are \emph{case-sensitive}.
In fact, JBLOGGS found that the column label for his \zcol\ data was
\pnam{Zcol}:
\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> readf myfile.dat xcol=1 ycol=3 zcol="Zcol"
File: /disk/scratch/jbloggs/plots/myfile.dat
XCOL - 1 is column number 1.
YCOL - 3 is column number 3.
ZCOL - Zcol is column number 5.
EXCOL - 0 is column number 0.
EYCOL - 0 is column number 0.
LABCOL - 0 is column number 0.
SYMCOL - 0 is column number 0.
42 data points read.
PONGO>
\end{terminalv}


\subsection{Strange behaviour of \cnam{DLIMITS}}

If PONGO does not seem to be doing something correctly, it is often
because there are unwanted data in the error columns.  This can come
about when a file that does not contain errors is read (the
appropriate parameters to \cnam{\iref{READF}} have been set to zero),
following one where there have been errors.
Here, it should be noted that setting a column parameter in
\cnam{\iref{READF}} to zero means that no data will be read from the
file into that particular area, it does not clear the data values.
This is a feature rather than a bug, because it allows X and Y data from two
different files to be plotted together, as long as each file contains the same
number of points (the number of points read from the second file is
assumed to be the number required).
Although advantageous, it is possible for the internal data areas to get into a
mess with this arrangement.
If this seems to have happened then the command:
\begin{terminalv}
PONGO> clear data
\end{terminalv}
should be used to clear all the data areas.


\subsection{Error messages from \cnam{SHOWPONGO} in ICL}

The commands \cnam{\iref{SHOWPONGO}} may sometimes deliver the error messages
\begin{terminalv}
!! Object 'PONGO_<param>' not found.
!! DAT_FIND: Error finding a named component in an HDS structure.
\end{terminalv}
when invoked (\verb+<param>+ refers to a PONGO parameter name in this
context).
The reason is simply that no global parameter of that name currently exists.
This can either be because PONGO has not been used before (or not a lot),
or because the ADAM global parameter file (\verb+$HOME/adam/GLOBAL.sdf+) has
been deleted since the last PONGO session.
Although the error messages look alarming, they are harmless.
To stop these error messages being output, the command \cnam{\iref{RESETPONGO}}
should be executed.
This command will assign a default value to each of the PONGO global parameters
except \pnam{PONGO\_DATA}, the data file name used by \cnam{\iref{READF}}, and
\cnam{\iref{SHOWPONGO}} will be subsequently more informative.


\subsection{AGI problems}

The \xref{AGI}{sun48}{} database is normally kept in a separate
\xref{HDS file}{sun95}{} \xref{(SG/4)}{sg4}{} for each machine in your
\verb+$HOME+ directory.  The command \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}} opens the
AGI database and reads database information relevant to the graphics
device being used.  During a PONGO plotting session, the database file
is held open to update the database as the plotting session proceeds.
At the end of plotting, when \cnam{\iref{ENDPLOT}} is executed, the
update of the database is completed and the database file is closed.
If another non-PONGO application which uses AGI is run before the
current PONGO plotting session has been ended (\ie using
\cnam{\iref{ENDPLOT}}), it will be unable to access the AGI database and will
subsequently fail.  In the event of this happening, using the PONGO
\cnam{\iref{ENDPLOT}} command will restore the correct behaviour of the
non-PONGO application.

What is more important, in order to use AGI successfully, is the use
of \cnam{\iref{ENDPLOT}} before exiting ICL or CL.  Because PONGO keeps the
AGI database file open throughout a plotting session it is possible to
exit ICL or CL without having first executed \cnam{\iref{ENDPLOT}}.  If this
is done, it is likely that the AGI database will not have been fully
updated before being closed, with the result that the next time AGI is
used it will behave inconsistently.  PONGO crashing during a plotting
session (hopefully, a rare event) can also result in a corrupted AGI
database.  There is no solution to this problem other than to delete
the database file and start again.  The AGI database files are kept in
the directory \verb+$HOME+ and have names of the form
\verb+agi_<machine>.sdf+, where \verb+<machine>+ is the name of the
machine on which AGI is being used.  This file may be deleted at any
time before a \cnam{BEGPLOT} command or after an \cnam{ENDPLOT} command.
The \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}} command may then be used to begin a new PONGO plot,
creating a new AGI database as a result.


\subsection{RESET peculiarity (ICL only)}

When using the ADAM parameter system \xref{(SG/4)}{sg4}{} \pnam{RESET}
qualifier to set parameters back to their default values (this
facility would be particularly useful for \cnam{\iref{BOXFRAME}}, for
example), there will be no effect on parameters which get their values
from global parameters. Use the \cnam{\iref{RESETPONGO}} command to
reset global parameters, or alternatively (somewhat drastically)
delete the \verb+GLOBAL.sdf+ file.

\subsection{Plotting large numbers of positions}
PONGO can store $5000$ positions at any time. This can very
occasionally cause problems for specific types of use. One way in
which you can actually plot more positions than this, is by reading in
the data in chunks (of 5000 points) and plotting these. The following
ICL procedure shows one way in which you might do this:
\begin{terminalv}
proc superplot file, x1, x2, y1, y2, n
  begplot xwindows xmin=(x1) xmax=(x2) ymin=(y1) ymax=(y2)
  limits (x1) (x2) (y1) (y2)
  boxframe
  loop for i = 0 to (n) step 1
    j = i + 1
    print "Plotting points from" (i*5000) " to " (j*5000-1)
    readf data=(file) xcol=1 ycol=2 from=(i*5000) to=(j*5000-1) all accept
    points
  end loop
  endplot
end proc
\end{terminalv}
This would then be invoked as in (assuming the procedure was kept in a

\section{PONGO Command Definitions} \label{defn_sect}

This section gives detailed descriptions for each of the PONGO
commands.  The commands are listed in alphabetical order.  A
description of the command is followed by a usage section and then a
description of each of the command parameters and its action.  The
usage section shows the order of any positional parameters and lists
any other required values. Positional parameters may be optional, if
a default exists, in which case they are shown in [].  For example the usage
section of \cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}} looks like:
\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\sstusage{
      begplot [device] [action] [clear] [overlay]
        \newline\hspace*{1.5em}
        $\left\{ {\begin{tabular}{l}
                                      label=? \\
                  \end{tabular} }
        \right.$
        \newline\hspace*{1.9em}
        \makebox[0mm][c]{\small action}
   }
\end{description}
\end{quote}
In this case all the positional parameters ([device] [action] [clear]
and [overlay]) are optional and have defaults. This example also
shows that the use of a non-positional parameter `label' is dependent on
the value of the parameter `action' (in fact it will only be used if
action is set to `L'). You need to consult the full parameter
descriptions to appreciate this. Non-positional parameters that are
normally defaulted are not shown in the usage section.

The full parameter descriptions include default behaviour; \ie what
value is taken if a parameter value is not given on the command line.
For simple cases, this behaviour is described in {\bf[} \emph{square
brackets} {\bf]}; for more complicated behaviour, a full description
is provided.  An empty set of square brackets, \ie \textbf{[]}, indicates
that a parameter value \emph{must} be specified on the command line.

Commands that are described as ICL procedures can only take
parameters on the command-line. These should be given as single
values in the correct order -- not as \verb+keyword=value+ pairs.

Commands that are described as synonyms such as \iref{CHANGE}~LINEWID=
must be given a single value for the first parameter.

If you are using CL then still consult this section, but use the
on-line help and the \verb+lparam+ command to determine the order and
availability of any parameters. You should also ignore any references
to global parameters (and in particular the behaviour of parameters
when they are specified on the command-line).

\section{PONGO and the MONGO Graphics Package}

PONGO has been designed to have broadly the same command interface as
that offered by the MONGO\footnote{The MONGO package was once
available at all Starlink nodes, at the time of writing this is no
longer the case, so this reference, indeed this whole section, is now
largely historical.} graphics package.  A number of aliases (ICL
DEFSTRING definitions) have been set up for certain commands so that
PONGO will do more or less what is expected for the equivalent MONGO
command, but there are some substantial differences.  It might well be
possible to do a better job of imitating MONGO using ICL procedures;
however, the aim is not to imitate the precise behaviour of MONGO, but
for existing users of MONGO to be met with a package that is not
totally unfamiliar to them when they begin using PONGO.  Ultimately,
PONGO offers substantially more than MONGO, both by its flexibility
and by what it can do.

}

Having read the rest of this document it will have become clear that there
are a substantial number of differences between MONGO and PONGO: perhaps
most significantly, it is not possible to run a MONGO script file and expect it
to work.
The most important difference at the command level is that once
\xcol\ \etc\ have been set up, the data must be input explicitly using the
\cnam{\iref{READF}} command, where MONGO would read the data in each time that a
command that needs them is executed.
\emph{Table \ref{mongo_same_tab}} is a list of the commands that work as
expected (with the above proviso) and \emph{Table \ref{mongo_diff_tab}} gives a

\section{Notes for IRAF/CL users}

The most noticable difference in the way that PONGO behaves and
``normal'' IRAF tasks is that it uses its own display and graphic
devices. To display on an X device the usual way of referring to a
window is by the name \verb+xw+. This is as used thoughout this
document. If you need to change the size of this window then use the
command (from the shell after closing the existing window):
\begin{terminalv}
% xmake xwindows -width xxx -height xxx
\end{terminalv}
You should not change the size of an X window after it is created.
The X window is created using the GWM services which you can read
more about in \xref{SUN/130}{sun130}{} (which, for instance, describes
other command-line options and how to set up your X resources to define the
window size). If you want to plot to a postscript file then there are
a range of possible devices, the most usual of which are
\verb+pscol_p+ (colour postscript portrait mode) and \verb+epsfcol_p+ (colour
encapsulated postscript). All the devices available can be viewed
using the \cnam{\iref{INQUIRE} DEVICES=YES} command.

The way that PONGO behaves when run from CL tends to be slightly
different to that indicated in the full routine descriptions. The main
changes are that some parameters will not behave as described and
there are very few of what are described as ``global parameters''. The
on-line help available in CL should show what the actual parameters
associated with a command are (you can, of course, also view these
using the \verb+lparam+ command).

The commands described as ``aliases'' and ``synonyms'' previously are
actually CL scripts most of which will work pretty much as
described. One problem to beware of is that several such commands do
not have any associated parameters (\ie \cnam{ADVANCE},
\cnam{CONNECT}, \cnam{ERASE}, \cnam{RESETPONGO}, \cnam{SHOWPONGO},
\cnam{VSTAND}, \cnam{WNAD}, \cnam{XLINEAR}, \cnam{XLOGARITHM},
\cnam{YLINEAR} and \cnam{YLOGARITHM}) so cannot be setup as part of a
\verb+mkscript+ session.

One unusual characteristic of PONGO commands is that some have what
are described as ``Write'' or ``Unused'' parameters. Both these types
cannot be set using \verb+eparam+ (or more precisely any values you
assign to these will be ignored). The ``Write'' parameters will be
modified when the command completes and are a way of getting values
back from the command for other uses (the \pnam{NDATA} parameter of
\cnam{READF} is one example, this is set to the actual number of
points read from the file).

If you want to know more about how Starlink packages operate from
IRAF/CL then see the document \xref{SUN/217}{sun217}{}.

\section{Changes}
\subsection {This release (2.0-2)}

PONGO now uses native PGPLOT for plotting rather than the deprecated
Starlink GKS PGPLOT. This should fix plotting and interoperability
problems with recent versions of KAPPA.

\subsection{Previous release (2.0-1)}

PONGO has been considerably extended to now work from the IRAF/CL
command language. To use this load the \verb+pongo+ package. The
commands that are available are the same as when running from ICL.

Other changes of note are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \cnam{\iref{READF}} command has been changed so that `@' is no
longer needed when using an ICL variable to store the file name. This
is INCOMPATIBLE with previous behaviour and any scripts using the `@'
form will need changing, i.e. lines with statements like:
\begin{terminalv}
READF DATA=('@'&FILE)
\end{terminalv}
  Should be changed to:
\begin{terminalv}
READF DATA=(FILE)
\end{terminalv}

\item An example has been added to the panic section to show how
PONGO can be used to plot more than 5000 points at a time (5000 is
the current maximum number of points that can be read at the same
time).

\item \cnam{READF} has been fixed so that it is possible to once again
read data from more than one file.

\item Errors in the documentation that still included descriptions of the
previous Chebyshev version of \cnam{\iref{FITLINE}} have been corrected.

\item A description of how to close the edges of grids has been added to
the \cnam{\iref{GRID}} command section. This command now also
attempts to complete latitude lines to their end points (this reduces
the ragged appearance at the ends of latitude lines).

\item The \cnam{\iref{YLINEAR}} command now works!

\item The \cnam{VP\_xx} commands have been modified to accept an
argument which indicates that space around the viewport should be reserved for
any labels.

\item \cnam{\iref{FITCURVE}} now uses the \pnam{XMIN} and \pnam{XMAX}
parameters as described (polynomial curves previously used all the
data). The \pnam{YMAX} and \pnam{YMIN} parameters are no longer used.
It also now writes any polynomial coefficients to a file (this can be
read by \cnam{\iref{PLOTFUN}}).

\item \cnam{FITCURVE} has also had a memory control bug fixed.

\item \cnam{\iref{CURSE}} now also reports approximate sky coordinates when
reading the cursor positions.

\item A new command \cnam{\iref{FILLSTY}} has been introduced. This
conveniently sets the fill-style attributes (for polygons and
histograms).

\item A new command \cnam{\iref{DRAWPOLY}} has been introduced. This
draws polygons  that can be filled.

\item A new command \cnam{\iref{SETPROJ}} has been introduced. This sets the
projection geometry related global variables (under CL this sets all
the parameters of the projection aware commands).

\item The \cnam{\iref{PRIM}} command now allows projections for all its
actions (this also effects the commands, \cnam{\iref{MOVE}} and
\cnam{\iref{DRAW}}). Note that the lines drawn are straight-lines on
the plot surface, not great circles. The \cnam{\iref{GT\_CIRCLE}}
command already supplies this ability.

\item The commands \cnam{\iref{XSCALE}}, \cnam{\iref{YSCALE}},
\cnam{\iref{YOFFSET}} and \cnam{\iref{XOFFSET}} now allow
negative factors.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Release 1.3}

PONGO has been updated to fix several problems with the
\cnam{\iref{BEGPLOT}} command. This now correctly selects the last AGI
DATA picture when \pnam{OVERLAY} is set (so that for instance
\xref{KAPPA}{sun95}{} images can be labelled), and avoids problems
when selecting pictures using labels (which resulted in a runaway
device open error condition).

If ICL is exited before closing PONGO (using the \cnam{\iref{ENDPLOT}}
command) a warning is now issued and an attempt to repair the AGI
database is now made.

A bug in the \cnam{\iref{ANNOTATE}} command has been fixed. This command now
correctly handles the \pnam{RACENTRE} and \pnam{DECCENTRE} parameters.

All PONGO command descriptions now include a usage section. This
shows the order of any positional parameters explicitly.

A new example procedure has been added to show the use of the
\cnam{\iref{VECT}} and \cnam{\iref{PVECT}} commands and how to label
astrometric projections.  The AGI example has been expanded to show
the results.

The routines \cnam{\iref{PLOTFUN}} and \cnam{\iref{FITCURVE}} have
been changed to remove the NAG dependency of PONGO.

The \cnam{\iref{FITCURVE}} command now fits a general, rather than a Chebyshev
polynomial and now has the ability to fit B-splines. Both these
functions can be re-plotted by the \cnam{\iref{PLOTFUN}} command.

\subsection{Release 1.2}

The ability to plot labels of the form \verb+HH MM SS.S+ and
\verb+DD MM SS.S+ has been added to the \cnam{\iref{BOXFRAME}}
command.

To use this just read in your positions in radians (the PONGO
command \cnam{\iref{READF}} already does this for you if the
positions are in \verb+HH:MM:SS+, \verb+DD:MM:SS+ format, or the
\cnam{\iref{DEGTOR}} command will convert
columns from degrees to radians) and then use a command like:
\begin{terminalv}
ICL> BOXFRAME XOPT='BCNSTZHG' YOPT='BCNSTZDG'
\end{terminalv}
This now uses the \xref{PGPLOT}{sun15}{} routine
\xref{PGTBOX}{sun15}{PGTBOX}.
\cnam{\iref{BOXFRAME}} has also been modified to allow the use of the "1" and "2"
option flags which force the labels to be all decimal or exponential
format.

Other changes are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \cnam{\iref{CHANGE}} command now supports hatched fill styles
and sets the
text background colour.
\item The \cnam{\iref{INQUIRE}} command reports the hatched fill style and text background
colour.
\item \cnam{\iref{PLOTHIST}} histograms can now be filled.
\end{enumerate}
