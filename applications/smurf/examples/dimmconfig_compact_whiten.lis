# *** Alternative to dimmconfig_bright_compact.lis using whitening ***
#
# This config file is for maps with a bright central compact
# source. Unlike dimmconfig_bright_compact.lis a whitening filter is
# used to remove residual low-frequency noise (instead of a fixed
# high-pass filter).  We constrain the map using
# ast.zero_circle=(0.025), which sets all pixels beyond 1.5 arcmin to
# zero until the last iteration.  A word of warning: if the source is
# near the edge of the map (or has an extent large than the size of
# this mask!) this configuration may give odd results.  If you suspect
# a problem, compare the location of the source to the zero-masked
# pixels (see QUALITY component of the resulting map). If the mask
# overlaps with the source, try modifying the radius.
#
# Low-frequency noise is removed using both common-mode and azimuth
# template removal, and then a whitening filter handles everything
# that is left-over.

# 20 is enough for most things... something like Jupiter might need
# more. For now you still need to turn on itermaps to see whether the
# map has converged visually or not.
