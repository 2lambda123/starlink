# Special configuration for pointing observations
# Similar to bright_compact except that we lower the speed limit

^$STARLINK_DIR/share/smurf/dimmconfig_bright_compact.lis

# Some pointings are done with slow speeds so tweak the lower
# limit. An example of this is 20091208#55 where 60% of the data
# are removed with the default flagging. That observation
# reduces fine with bright_compact but fails with the default
# flagslow of 30 using this config.
flagslow = 20
