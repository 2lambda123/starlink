# *** Specialized config for scans of bright/extended structure ***
#
# For bright extended regions we increase the number of
# iterations. This is required because we have not yet implemented an
# automatic convergence test for the larger-scale structures in the
# map. We also turn on zero-masking based on a map pixel SNR threshold
# of 5-sigma. This prefents ringing a round bright sources, but will
# completely flatten the map in low-SNR regions.
