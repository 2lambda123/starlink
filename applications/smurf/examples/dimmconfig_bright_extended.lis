#  Name:
#     dimmconfig_bright_extended.lis

#  Purpose:
#     A MAKEMAP configuration suitable for bright extended sources .

#  Description:
#     This file provides values for parameters used by the SMURF:MAKEMAP
#     command to control the details of the map-making algorithm. To
#     use it, assign it to the CONFIG parameter on the command line when
#     running MAKEMAP. For instance:
#
#     % makemap config=^/star/share/smurf/dimmconfig_bright_compact.lis
#
#     (substitute the path to your Starlink installation in place of
#     "/star").
#
#     For bright extended regions we turn on AST zero-masking based on a map
#     pixel SNR threshold of 5-sigma. This prevents ringing around bright
#     sources, but will completely flatten the map in low-SNR regions.

#  Notes:
#     - Any parameter not set in this configuration defaults to the value
#     specified in file $STARLINK_DIR/smurf_makemap.def.
#     - For a full list of all available parameters, and their purposes,
#     see the file $SMURF_DIR/smurf_makemap.def. All available parameters
#     are also documented in SUN/258, appendix "Configuration Parameters".
#     - A single parameter can be given different values to use when
#     processing 450 or 850 um data. This is done by including the
#     parameter twice, prefixing the parameter name with "450." and "850."

#  History:
#     12-FEB-2013 (HP):
#        General tidy.
#     14-FEB-2013 (DSB):
#        Use a standard prologue format. Re-instated comments describing
#        rationale for each value.
#     5-JUN-2014 (DSB):
#        - Use 5 initial no-AST iteration to determine a reasonable map
#        that can then be used a the basis for FLT-masking when the AST
#        model is re-introduced. Should help with convergence, and reduce
#        bowling. (DSB)
#        - Define the AST mask at SNR=3 instead of SNR=5 (HP)
#        - Extend the mask defined at SNR=3 down to SNR=2. This has the
#        side effect of smoothing the perimeter of the mask and removing
#        isolated pixels. (DSB)
#        - Reduce the filter scale from 600 to 480 (HP)
#     17-MAR-2015 (DSB):
#        Remove dependence on dimmconfig.lis.
