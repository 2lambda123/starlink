# For bright extended regions we turn on zero-masking based on a map
# pixel SNR threshold of 5-sigma. This prefents ringing a round bright
# sources, but will completely flatten the map in low-SNR regions.

# these set up map-based convergence tests: a maximum of 40 iterations,
# but it will stop if there is a mean absolute change in the map between
# subsequent iterations of less than 5% (note also that we explicitly
# turn the chi^2 test off).
