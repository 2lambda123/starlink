# *** Specialized config to use PCA cleaning on faint point-source fields ***
#
# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify and remove
# correlated noise. The method projects all of the bolometers along
# a new set of statistically independent basis vectors, and removes
# the signal associated with the strongest of these vectors.
# Currently this is applied as a pre-processing step, and is performed
# instead of COMmon-mode rejection and high-pass FiLTering. For this
# reason there is a simplified modelorder. A minimal number of iterations
# is required simply to identify the noise weights and to perform
# map-based despiking. The single pcathresh parameter is used to establish
# which correlated components to remove: a smaller value will remove more
# components, and a larger value fewer components.
#
# This method is somewhat of a statistical black-box, and therefore
# requires simulations for characterization. It is also *extremely* slow.
# Probably only useful for compact / point-sources as large-scale structures
# are even more heavily filtered than with the usual processing. Extremely
# bright sources cause strange results.
