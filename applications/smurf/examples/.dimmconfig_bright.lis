#  Name:
#     .dimmconfig_bright.lis

#  Purpose:
#     A MAKEMAP configuration suitable for bright sources.

#  Description:
#     This file provides values for parameters used by the SMURF:MAKEMAP
#     command to control the details of the map-making algorithm.
#
#     This file is not intended to be used directly by users. Its purpose
#     is to provide settings that are common to other, more specialised,
#     configurations that handle various forms of bright sources. See
#     for instance, /star/share/smurf/dimmconfig_bright_compact.lis. For
#     this reason, the file has been "hidden" by putting a dot at the
#     start of the name.
#
#     Maps of bright sources, regardless of their physical extent,
#     generally require less aggressive rejection of bad data due to the
#     presence of strong astronomical signals (which may accidentally be
#     identified as steps, throw-off the common-mode bolometer rejection,
#     contaminate noise estimates etc.). They also generally require a
#     larger number of iterations to maximize the sensitivty to large
#     dynamic signal ranges in the map.

#  Notes:
#     - Any parameter not set in this configuration defaults to the value
#     specified in file $STARLINK_DIR/smurf_makemap.def.
#     - For a full list of all available parameters, and their purposes,
#     see the file $SMURF_DIR/smurf_makemap.def. All available parameters
#     are also documented in SUN/258, appendix "Configuration Parameters".
#     - A single parameter can be given different values to use when
#     processing 450 or 850 um data. This is done by including the
#     parameter twice, prefixing the parameter name with "450." and "850."

#  History:
#     12-FEB-2013 (HP):
#        General tidy. Emphasise that this config should not be used
#        directly.
#     12-FEB-2013 (DSB):
#        Use a standard prologue format. Re-instated comments describing
#        rationale for each value.
#     25-FEB-2013 (DSB):
#        Change the name to include an initial dot, thus making the file
#        hidden.
#     17-MAR-2015 (DSB):
#        Remove dependence on dimmconfig.lis.
