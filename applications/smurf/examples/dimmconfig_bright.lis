# *** Specialized config for bright sources ***
#
# Maps of bright sources, regardless of their physical extent,
# generally require less aggressive rejection of bad data due to the
# presence of strong astronomical signals (which may accidentally be
# identified as steps, throw-off the common-mode bolometer rejection,
# contaminate noise estimates etc.). They also generally require a
# larger number of iterations to maximize the sensitivty to large
# dynamic signal ranges in the map.

# chunks. Even if we get chunked common-mode flagging to work much
# better, these maps of bright point sources may cause problems.
