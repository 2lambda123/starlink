# *** Specialized config for finely-spaced scans of bright sources ***
#
# To produce focal plane distortion maps we produce very finely-spaced
# maps of bright calibrators so that we can produce fully-sampled images
# for each bolometer. We start with the bright_compact config as a
# a template.
#
# The bolomap=1 flag has been set. This will produce a series of
# extensions (.MORE.SMURF.BOLOMAPS) in the main map for working
# bolometer:
#
#   gaia [output map name].more.smurf.bolomaps
#
# Finely, we set ensureflat=0 so that the bolometer data are left in raw
# DAC units. In these units sources will look like negative holes rather
# than positive peaks! The purpose of this is to enable us to compare
# flatfields from an astronomical source (relative intensities of a
# calibrator in each detector) with those from heater ramps.
#
# *******************************************************************


# We propagate the variance from the time series since it is the only way
# to get a reasonable estimate for the single-bolo maps where many pixels
# only have one or two samples (so sample variance is almost meaningless).
#
# method of estimating variance map:
#  0 = propagate from the time-domain noise (requires noi model component)
#  1 = sample variance of data that land in each pixel
varmapmethod = 0

# Create single-beam maps in addition to main map
bolomap = 1

# Do not flatfield data so that the maps are in DAC units.
ensureflat=0

# map-based despiking will have a harded time since the calculation is
# theoretical, and we also haven't flat-fielded. Back off on the threshold
# so that we don't accidentally flag the source!
