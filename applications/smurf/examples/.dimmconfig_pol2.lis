#  Name:
#     .dimmconfig_pol2.lis

#  Purpose:
#     A MAKEMAP configuration for making POL-2 scan & spin maps.

#  Description:
#     This file provides values for parameters used by the SMURF:MAKEMAP
#     command to control the details of the map-making algorithm.
#
#     This file is not intended to be used directly by users. Its purpose
#     is to provide settings that are common to other, more specialised,
#     POL-2 configurations that handle various forms of sources. See
#     for instance, /star/share/smurf/dimmconfig_pol2_compact.lis. For
#     this reason, the file has been "hidden" by putting a dot at the
#     start of the name.

#  Notes:
#     - Any parameter not set in this configuration defaults to the value
#     specified in file $STARLINK_DIR/smurf_makemap.def.
#     - For a full list of all available parameters, and their purposes,
#     see the file $SMURF_DIR/smurf_makemap.def. All available parameters
#     are also documented in SUN/258, appendix "Configuration Parameters".
#     - A single parameter can be given different values to use when
#     processing 450 or 850 um data. This is done by including the
#     parameter twice, prefixing the parameter name with "450." and "850."
