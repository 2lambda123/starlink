#  Name:
#     dimmconfig_fix_convergence.lis

#  Purpose:
#     A MAKEMAP configuration add-on for speeding up convergence.

#  Description:
#     This file provides values for additional parameters used by the
#     SMURF:MAKEMAP command to control the details of the map-making
#     algorithm.
#
#     The parameters defined by this file attempt to aid the convergence
#     process, and should be used for maps that will not converge within
#     a reasonable number of iterations.
#
#     This file does not provide a complete set of parameters, and
#     so should be included in the configuration following another
#     config that provides a complete set. The values defined in this
#     file then over-ride the values supplied by the earlier config.
#     For instance, you may want to use a config file that contains:
#
#     ^/star/share/smurf/dimmconfig_bright_compact.lis
#     ^/star/share/smurf/dimmconfig_fix_convergence.lis
#
#     This reads a complete set of configuration parameter from the
#     dimmconfig_bright_compact.lis file, and then assigns new values
#     for just those parameters defined in dimmconfig_fix_convergence.lis.
#     These values over-ride the values specified in
#     dimmconfig_bright_compact.lis.

#  Notes:
#     - For a full list of all available parameters, and their purposes,
#     see the file $SMURF_DIR/smurf_makemap.def. All available parameters
#     are also documented in SUN/258, appendix "Configuration Parameters".
#     - A single parameter can be given different values to use when
#     processing 450 or 850 um data. This is done by including the
#     parameter twice, prefixing the parameter name with "450." and "850."
