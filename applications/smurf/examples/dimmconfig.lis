#  This file is retained for historical purposes only, and should no
#  longer be used.

#  Before Starlink release 2015A, this file contained values for a
#  selection of configuration parameters.  However those values were
#  simply copies of the default values defined in file
#  $SMURF_DIR/smurf_makemap.def and so were unneeded (any parameter for
#  which no value is supplied in a configuration file defaults to the
#  value in smurf_makemap.def).
#
#  In addition, JCMT would like to move users away from the idea that
#  dimmconfig.lis is a good default configuration. We are now
#  recommending that people use dimmconfig_jsa_generic.lis as the
#  starting point for their map-making experiments since it produces
#  superior results (but one of the more specific dimmconfigs such as
#  dimmconfig_bright_extended.lis etc will usually be more appropriate).
#
#  Users existing personal configuration files that start by including
#  dimmconfig.lis should be unaffected by this change. In future, if you
#  want to create a configuration file that starts from the defaults that
#  were previously in dimmconfig.lis, you should simply omit the starting
#  line  "^$STARLINK_DIR/share/smurf/dimmconfig.lis". So for instance if
#  you config used to be:
#
#  	^$STARLINK_DIR/share/smurf/dimmconfig.lis
#  	maptol = 0.01
#  	numiter = -40
#
#  It can now just be:
#
#  	maptol = 0.01
#  	numiter = -40
#
#  Note, since this file is now empty (other than these comment lines),
#  continuing to include it as in the first example above is safe, but
#  unnecessary.
