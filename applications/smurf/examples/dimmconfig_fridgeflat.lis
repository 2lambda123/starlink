# *** Specialized config for measuring flatfields with fridge oscillations ***
#
# The purpose of this config is to measure the amplitude of the fridge
# fluctuations. Polynomial baselines are removed from both the
# bolometer and dark-squid data (hopefully removes the bulk of
# presumed longer-timescale sky fluctuations). The solution uses the
# COM/GAI model to fit the primary oscillations which are produced by
# fridge variations, and DKS is also used in case there is strong
# magentic field pickup. Otherwise there is no special filtering of
# the data. The relative amplitudes of each detector are stored in the
# exported "GAI" model component (first 2d plane). There is no
# extinction correction because we are not interested in astronomical
# signal units.
#
# Note that if this configuration is used with a scan of a
# particularly bright source there could be significant contamination.
#
# It is probably a good idea to use large map pixel sizes. We're not
# really interested in the map at all, and this will probably help
# reduce the impact of astronomical sources (which will be wrong from
# detector-to-detector because we don't flatfield the data in advance
# using the heaters).
