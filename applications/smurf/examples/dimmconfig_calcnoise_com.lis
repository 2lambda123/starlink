# *** Specialized config for CALCNOISE with common-mode subtraction ***
#
# This variant on the CALCNOISE cleaning configuration uses
# common-mode subtraction instead of polynomials. We don't let the
# common-mode removal flag outlier bolometers because it is not very
# robust for short time-series (there isn't much low-frequency
# structure for it to fit), so we introduce clipping of extremely
# noisy bolometers prior to the common-mode removal. We also turn off
# boxcar smoothing so that the common-mode removal has the potential
# to remove correlated noise at higher frequencies (i.e., in the white
# noise measurement band of 2--10 Hz).
