# *** Specialized config for bright, isolated compact sources ***
#
# This config file is for maps with a bright central compact source. In
# particular the strategy is aimed at short scans of calibrators (which
# may be quite bright).
#
# The template for this configuration is dimmconfig_newfilt which is
# identical to the default dimmconfig, except that it uses a window
# function to handle gaps in the data, rather than gap-filling with a
# noise realization. This method is slightly slower and uses more
# memory, but enables us to use all of the available data, including
# the ends of the data stream that would normally be apodized. This is
# particularly useful for some of the very short scans used, for
# example, for focus (as short as 10 seconds).
# *** CURRENTLY NOT TRUE, HAVE REVERTED TO OLD METHOD FOR NOW ***
#
# We constrain the edges of the map using ast.zero_circle=(0.0055555),
# which sets all pixels beyond 20 arcsec to zero until the last
# iteration.  A word of warning: if the source is near the edge of the
# map this configuration may give odd results due to the value of
# ast.zero_lowhits!  If you suspect a problem, compare the location of
# the source to the zero-masked pixels (see QUALITY component of the
# resulting map). If the mask overlaps with the source, try modifying
# the radius.
#
# Finally, we delay calculation of the common-mode (and associated
# bolometer rejection) until after the first iteration. For short
# scans this can be important as the astronomical signal may dominate.
#
# ***********************************************************

# more iterations in case there is poor cross-linking
numiter = 20

# delay calculation of COM until after the first iteration since the source
# may be brighter than the common-mode signal.
com.notfirst = 1
