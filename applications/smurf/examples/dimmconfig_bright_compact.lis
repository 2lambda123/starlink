# *** Specialized config for bright, isolated compact sources ***
#
# This config file is for maps with a bright central compact source. In
# particular the strategy is aimed at short scans of calibrators (which
# may be quite bright).
#
# We constrain the map using ast.zero_circle=(0.01666), which sets all
# pixels beyond 60 arcsec to zero until the last iteration.  A word of
# warning: if the source is near the edge of the map (or has an extent
# large than the size of this mask!) this configuration may give odd
# results due to the value of ast.zero_lowhits!  If you suspect a
# problem, compare the location of the source to the zero-masked
# pixels (see QUALITY component of the resulting map). If the mask
# overlaps with the source, try modifying the radius.
#
# ***********************************************************

# these set up map-based convergence tests: a maximum of 40 iterations,
# but it will stop if there is a mean absolute change in the map between
# subsequent iterations of less than 5% (note also that we explicitly
# turn the chi^2 test off).
