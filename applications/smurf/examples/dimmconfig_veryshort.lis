# *** Specialized config for short scans of bright source ***

# The main features of this config file is that we we remove the FLT
# model component (as well as the padding/apodization) as they are
# unnecessary -- the assumption is that low-frequency baseline drifts
# are going to be very small for a short scan of order 10
# seconds. Also, with so little data to work with any padding
# etc. will remove significant amounts of data. We also delay
# calculation of the common-mode (and hence rejection of bolometers)
# until after the first iteration so that there is less contamination
# from the astronomical signal (com.notfirst).
