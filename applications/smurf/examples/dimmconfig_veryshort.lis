# *** Specialized config for short scans of bright source ***

# The main features of this config file is that we we remove the FLT
# model component (as well as the padding/apodization) as they are
# unnecessary -- the assumption is that low-frequency baseline drifts
# are going to be very small for a short scan of order 10
# seconds. Also, with so little data to work with any padding
# etc. will remove significant amounts of data.
#
# We do add SMO though since it does seem to make a difference to the
# quality of the maps in many cases despite the notion that 1/f
# should not be a problem in 15 seconds.

# Assumes any compact source is not extremely bright.
# Use dimmconfig_veryshort_planet.lis for planets.
