# *** Config for exporting SCUBA-2 data to process with other software ***
#
# In order to process SCUBA-2 data using other software there are several
# specialized tasks that SMURF is well-suited for, in particular applying
# the flatfields, and fixing / flagging some of the major glitches. This
#
# Config file:
#
#    1. Flags bad bolometers, fixes DC steps, and applies the flatfield
#    2. Down-samples the data to a frequency appropriate for the scan speed
#       and either 2 or 4-arcsec pixels at 450 and 850um respectively
#    2. Exports these cleaned data to a file
#    3. Runs a short 2-iteration map using generic settings in order to
#       use the map-based despiker to generate a QUALITY array
#    4. Exports the residual model component including the QUALITY array
#    5. Writes-out the RA and DEC of every data sample
#
# ************************************************************************

# Two iterations: just enough to get reasonable bolometer weights and estimate
# a single map in which we can look for spikes
numiter=2

# write out the cleaned data prior to map-making
exportclean=1

# write out the pointing infortmation
exportlonlat=1

# write out the residual with the quality component
exportndf = (res,qua)
