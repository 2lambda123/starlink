# *** Specialized config for scans of faint/extended structure ***

# Without bright emission in the field we can get away with a
# single high-pass filter at the start (i.e. there won't be a lot
# of ringing). We then only use COM, GAI, and DKS to remove remaining
# low-frequency noise. We also use a more aggressive cut to remove
# the noisier (and probably less-linear and problematic) bolometers.
