# *** Specialized config for scans of faint/extended structure ***
#
# Without bright emission in the field we can get away with a
# single high-pass filter at the start (i.e. there won't be a lot
# of ringing). For wide area scans there can also be a significant
# component of scan-synchronous noise caused by magnetic field pickup.
# Since we are not iteratively filtering the low-frequency noise the
# map solver is stable enough to attempt to fit out the dark squid
# measurements which are sensitive primarily to this pickup (the DKS
# model). We also use a more aggressive cut to remove
# the noisier (and probably less-linear and problematic) bolometers.
#
# To see how important the DKS signal is, the model can be exported.
# However, the default compressed format is not easy to view. Instead,
# run the "_dks" files through the SMURF task sc2expandmodel to produce
# a full 3d data cube of the model.
