# *** Specialized config for CALCNOISE with PCA cleaning ***
#
# This variant on the CALCNOISE cleaning configuration uses PCA
# cleaning instead of polynomials. We introduce clipping of extremely
# noisy bolometers prior to the PCA cleaning which may help identify
# the most important correlated modes. PCA cleaning is extremely slow.
# It also seems to work better on short data sets. So, I recommend using
# this only to analyze short snippets of data (e.g. 2000 samples).
#
# ***********************************************************************

# Just remove the mean
order = 0

# clip really noisy bolos prior to PCA cleaning (not obvious, but
# setting the noiseclipprecom flag will do this)
noiseclipprecom=1
noisecliphigh=10

# set a lower value if you want to remove more correlated noise
pcathresh = 4
