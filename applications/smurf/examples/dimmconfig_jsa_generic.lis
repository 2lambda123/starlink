#  Name:
#     dimmconfig_jsa_generic.lis

#  Purpose:
#     A MAKEMAP configuration suitable for general-purpose use.

#  Description:
#     This file provides values for parameters used by the SMURF:MAKEMAP
#     command to control the details of the map-making algorithm. To
#     use it, assign it to the CONFIG parameter on the command line when
#     running MAKEMAP. For instance:
#
#     % makemap config=^/star/share/smurf/dimmconfig_jsa_generic.lis
#
#     (substitute the path to your Starlink installation in place of
#     "/star").
#
#     This file aims to be conservative and so sacrifices some real
#     extended structure in order to reduce the risk of artificial
#     extended structures appearing in the map. It does this by using a
#     separate common mode for each sub-array, and by using a smaller filter
#     size. Otherwise, it is similar to dimmconfig_bright_extended.lis.

#  Notes:
#     - Any parameter not set in this configuration defaults to the value
#     specified in file $STARLINK_DIR/smurf_makemap.def.
#     - For a full list of all available parameters, and their purposes,
#     see the file $SMURF_DIR/smurf_makemap.def. All available parameters
#     are also documented in SUN/258, appendix "Configuration Parameters".
#     - A single parameter can be given different values to use when
#     processing 450 or 850 um data. This is done by including the
#     parameter twice, prefixing the parameter name with "450." and "850."
