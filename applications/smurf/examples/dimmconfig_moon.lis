# *** Specialized config for the moon ***
#
# This config file is for the fairly specialized case of scans across
# the moon (tuned  using 850um observations 20110328 #40). Astronomical
# signal dominates everything else, so we place map estimation *before*
# the removal of low-frequency noise (see modelorder). In addition, we
# set the filter scale to 0.5 deg, the approximate diameter of the disk.
# Common-mode removal is completely turned off. Noise in the
# WVM signal can cause significant steps, so we instead use CSOTAU as
# a fixed zenith opacity monitor (which internally gets converted into
# line-of-sight values smoothly with elevation). Finally, we use a
# zero-constraint to provide a solid baseline beyond the edge of the moon
# as a reference, and to help the solution converge.
