# *** Specialized config for CALCNOISE ***
#
# The purpose of CALCNOISE is to estimate the white noise level of the
# bolometers using cleaning steps that are similar to those used by
# MAKEMAP. This configuration ensures that DC step correction is
# applied.  A low-order polynomial is also removed from the
# time-series to avoid ringing in the FFTs. Finally, we don't turn off
# the excessively noisy bolometers since we want to measure the
# properties of as many bolometers as possible rather than make a map.
