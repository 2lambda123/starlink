# *** Specialized config for CALCNOISE ***
#
# The purpose of CALCNOISE is to estimate the white noise level of the
# bolometers using cleaning steps that are similar to those used by
# MAKEMAP. This configuration ensures that DC step correction is
# applied.  A low-order polynomial is also removed from the
# time-series to avoid ringing in the FFTs. This method is quite
# robust for short time-series (less than 30 seconds or so) in the
# sense that it will give a decent answer for even poor data sets
# although there is a potential for the answer to be a bit high due to
# correlated noise getting through the polynomial baseline removal in
# the measurement band (default 2--10 Hz). This is probably the best
# method to use in the pipeline. Alternative methods for removing
# correlated noise are using common-mode subtraction (see
# dimmconfig_calcnoise_com.lis) and PCA cleaning (see
# dimmconfig_calcnoise_pca.lis). We don't turn off the excessively
# noisy bolometers since we want to measure the properties of as many
# bolometers as possible rather than make a map. We also turn off
# flagging of data taken while the telescope is moving too fast or too
# slow.
