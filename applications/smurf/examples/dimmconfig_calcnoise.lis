# *** Specialized config for CALCNOISE ***
#

# The purpose of CALCNOISE is to estimate the white noise level of the
# bolometers using cleaning steps that are similar to those used by
# MAKEMAP. This configuration ensures that DC step correction is
# applied.  A low-order polynomial is also removed from the
# time-series to avoid ringing in the FFTs. Alternatively, you could
# comment out "order=3" and instead use common-mode subtraction to
# remove low frequency noise (remove commented lines for
# "compreprocess" and "com.noflag". Finally, we don't turn off the
# excessively noisy bolometers since we want to measure the properties
# of as many bolometers as possible rather than make a map.

#
# ***********************************************************************

# Default behaviour is to use a low-order polynomial to remove
# low-frequency noise. However, you can comment out this line and
# instead use common-mode subtraction.
order = 3

# If you use common-mode subtraction instead, it may be a good idea to
# turn off the flagging of bad bolos using the com.noflag option.
#compreprocess=1
#com.noflag=1

# turn off noise clipping during pre-processing since CALCNOISE has its
# own ADAM parameters to control clipping
