# *** Alternative config using time-domain whitening ***
#
# This is an experimental config that uses the time-domain whitening
# filter. The idea is to use common-mode removal to get rid of most
# of the junk, and then use a whitening filter to automatically remove
# residual low-frequency noise on a bolo-by-bolo basis. For now I
# have turned off the GAIn component, so exactly the same ampltide common-mode
# is removed from each bolo, and no bad-bolo flagging happens within the
# COM model. This seems to work fairly well in that it gives flatter maps,
# but needs a lot of iterations to get rid of bowls around bright sources.
# Since I still don't have a good map-based convergence test I've just set
# it to 20 for now, and turned on itermaps. Look at the .more.smurf.itermaps
# extensions after running once to see if you need more or less iterations.
# for the s4a Uranus observations in $STARLINK_DIR/share/smurf/s4a*.sdf I
# only needed about 7 iterations. For some old OMC-1 data it clearly needed
# more iterations than 50...
#
# One final note: on that s4a Uranus data I noticed that a bunch of
# bolometers start going crazy around iteration 12, and the whole thing
# blows up.
