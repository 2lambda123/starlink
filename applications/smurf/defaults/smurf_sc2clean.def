#  Purpose:
#     Default parameters for SMURF application MAKEMAP.

#  Description:
#     This file specifies the default parameters for the SC2CLEAN
#     application.The main purpose of this file is to
#     guarantee an initial state for all parameters and to define all
#     the allowed parameters so that a user will be notified in case
#     of spelling mistakes.
#
#     This file is also loaded by the map maker defaults file.

#  Notes:
#     This file does not attempt to document what each value
#     means.
