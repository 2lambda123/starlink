#     smurf_calcqu.def

#  Purpose:
#     Default parameters for SMURF application CALCQU.

#  Description:
#     This file specifies the default parameters for the CALCQU
#     application.The main purpose of this file is to guarantee
#     an initial state for all parameters and to define all the
#     allowed parameters so that a user will be notified in case
#     of spelling mistakes. However, the default values themselves
#     are significant in that many have been copied form the default
#     dimmconfig.lis file.

#  Notes:
#     This file does not attempt to document what each value means.

#        Original version. Factored out from smurf_sc2clean.def for clarity.

#-


#  Include the makemap defaults so that a makemap config file can be
#  supplied to calcqu. Do it first so that we can then overfride these
#  default values with values more appropriate for calcqu.

#  CALCQU specific parameters:


#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	pasign
#  Type: 	int
#  Default: 	1
#  Purpose: 	Indicates the sense of rotation of the spinning half-wave
#		plate.
#  Description: If non-zero, it is assumed that a positive POL_ANG value
#		corresponds to rotation from focal plane X to focal plane Y
#		axis. If zero, it is assumed that a positive POL_ANG value
#		corresponds to rotation from focal plane Y to focal plane X
#		axis.
pasign = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	paoff
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0.0
#  Purpose: 	Specifies the orientation of the have-wave plate origin
#  Description: This is the angle from the fixed analyser to the have-wave
#		plate for a POL_ANG value of zero, in degrees. Measured
#		positive in the same sense as rotation from focal plane X
#		to focal plane Y.
paoff = 0.0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	angrot
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	90
#  Purpose: 	Specifies the orientation of the fixed analyser
#  Description: The angle from the focal plane X axis to the fixed
#		analyser, in degrees. Measured positive in the same sense
#		as rotation from focal plane X to focal plane Y.
angrot = 90.0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	submean
#  Type: 	int
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Experimental
#  Description: If non-zero, the mean value is subtracted from each
#		time-slice before calculating the Q and U values. This
#		typically has very little effect.
submean = 0
