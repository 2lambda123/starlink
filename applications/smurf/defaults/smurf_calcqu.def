#  Name:
#     smurf_calcqu.def

#  Purpose:
#     Default parameters for SMURF application CALCQU.

#  Description:
#     This file specifies the default parameters for the CALCQU
#     application.The main purpose of this file is to guarantee
#     an initial state for all parameters and to define all the
#     allowed parameters so that a user will be notified in case
#     of spelling mistakes. However, the default values themselves
#     are significant in that many have been copied form the default
#     dimmconfig.lis file.

#  Notes:
#     This file does not attempt to document what each value means.

#  Authors:
#     DSB: David Berry (JAC, Hawaii)

#        Original version. Factored out from smurf_sc2clean.def for clarity.
