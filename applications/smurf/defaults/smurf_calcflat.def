#  Name:
#     smurf_calcflat.def

#  Purpose:
#     Define default flatfield configuration values

#  Language:
#     Starlink config text file (as used by kpg1Kymap)

#  Description:
#     This file contains the nominal resistor settings for each bolometer.
#     Per-subarray values can be specified in the general file.

#  Notes:
#     Deliberately not a binary file. To allow easy editing.
#     Deliberately not an XML file since SMURF does not want to have a dependency
#     on an XML parser.

#  History:
#     2008-08-26 (TIMJ):
#        Reimplementation of resist.xml file
#     2010-04-20 (TIMJ):
#        Columns are numbered from 0 not 1 to be consistent with the rest
#        of SMURF.
#     2010-07-15 (TIMJ):
#        Defaults copied from resist.cfg
#     {enter_further_changes_here}
