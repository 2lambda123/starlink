#  Name:
#     smurf_extinction.def

#  Purpose:
#     Extinction correction parameters

#  Description
#     This file contains constants used for handling extinction
#     correction. The names in these values are not sub-instrument
#     names but are instead filter names. For SCUBA-2 it so happens that
#     the first filters to be used were named after the sub-instrument.

#  Notes:
#     This file is loaded by the map-maker defaults file. It is
#     separate to make it easier to be loaded into the EXTINCTION
#     task and in that it differs somewhat from other defaults
#     used by the map-maker.

# The following entries parametrise the tau relations
# of the form
#
#   tau_filt = a ( tau_cso + b )
#
# Each entry is named for the filter name as we expect
# the value to depend on the filter not just the
# sub-instrument. For this reason they are not simply
# implemented as "450.ext.taurelation"

# Original filters delivered for SCUBA-2. Named "450" and "850".

# Control whether we want WVM smoothing. The value is the

# smoothing.
