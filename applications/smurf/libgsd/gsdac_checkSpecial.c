*  Name:
*     gsdac_checkSpecial.c

*  Purpose:
*     Check to see if this is a special configuration.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     gsdac_checkSpecial ( const gsdVars *gsdVars, int *special, 
*                          int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     gsdVars = const gsdVars* (Given)
*        GSD file access parameters.
*     special = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Flag for special configurations.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.  

*  Description:
*     This routine checks the spacing of the frequencies in the 
*     subbands to see if this is a special configuration.
