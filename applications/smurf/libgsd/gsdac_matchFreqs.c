*  Name:
*     gsdac_matchFreqs.c

*  Purpose:
*     Checks for special configurations in order to determine
*     which subbands should share a rest frequency and IF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     gsdac_matchFreqs ( const gsdVars *gsdVars, double *lineFreqs,
*                        double *IFFreqs, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     gsdVars = const gsdVars* (Given)
*        GSD file access parameters.
*     lineFreqs = double* (Given and Returned)
*        Line frequency of molecular transition.
*     IFFreqs = double* (Given and Returned)
*        Array of IFFreqs to be associated with each subband.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine checks the spacing of the frequencies in the
*     subbands to see if this is a special configuration.  It then
*     determines which subbands should share a common IFFreq and
*     what it should be for those subbands.  Each subband's IFFreq
*     is then stored in the IFFreqs array.  In order to determine
*     the correct rest frequency for the molecular transition,
*     the same matching is performed.
*
*     NOTE: currently this routine only determines whether all
*     subbands belong together or not.  It does not deal with
*     observation in which some BUT NOT ALL subbands belong
*     together.  In its current form, matchFreqs is an
*     all-or-nothing method.
