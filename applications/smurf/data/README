Data files needed by SMURF

*_heateff.sdf are heater efficiency files used by SCUBA-2 flatfielding. They
will be installed into $STARLINK_DIR/share/smurf and are referenced from the
resist.cfg configuration file.


optff-*.sdf are the optical flatfield files that can be referred to by
makemap and sc2clean config parameters OPTFFS8A, OPTFFS8B, etc. They are
generated using the "opteff" script in the "scripts" directory of the
smurf distribution.
