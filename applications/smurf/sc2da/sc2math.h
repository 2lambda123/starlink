*  Name:
*     sc2math.h

*  Purpose:
*     Prototypes and constants for the sc2math library

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Header File

*  Invocation:
*     #include "sc2math.h"

*  Description:
*     Prototypes and constants used by the sc2math functions.

*  Authors:

*  History:
*     2008-05-06 (BDK) this file now contains more than just the
*                prototypes, so include sc2math_pro.h. This allows the
*                prototypes to be created in the data acquisition
*                system, but this is hidden from smurf.
