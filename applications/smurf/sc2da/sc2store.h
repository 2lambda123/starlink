*  Name:
*     sc2store.h

*  Purpose:
*     Prototypes for the sc2store library

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Header File

*  Invocation:
*     #include "sc2store.h"

*  Description:
*     Prototypes used by the sc2store functions.

*  Authors:
*     B.D.Kelly (bdk@roe.ac.uk)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     2007-04-30 (BDK) this file now contains more than just the
*                prototypes, so include sc2store_pro.h. This allows the
*                prototypes to be created in the data acquisition
*                system, but this is hidden from smurf.
*     2008-05-15 (BDK) add SC2STORETelpar structure.
*     2008-05-28 (BDK) add sc2store_par.h.
*     2008-07-24 (TIMJ) add instap to Telpar struct.
