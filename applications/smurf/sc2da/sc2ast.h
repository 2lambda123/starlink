*  Name:
*     sc2ast.h

*  Purpose:
*     Prototypes for the sc2ast library

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Header File

*  Invocation:
*     #include "sc2ast.h"

*  Description:
*     Prototypes used by the sc2ast functions.

*  Authors:
*     B.D.Kelly (bdk@roe.ac.uk)
*     Tim Jenness (timj@jach.hawaii.edu)
*     D.S. Berry (dsb@ast.man.ac.uk)
*     E.Chapin (echapin@phas.ubc.ca)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     2006-08-15 (EC):
*        Placed comments at top of header, added SC2AST_BOLCOL/BOLROW
*     2006-08-17 (EC):
*        Removed SC2AST_BOLCOL/BOLROW,sc2ast_get_gridcoords->smf_get_gridcoords
*     2006-09-07 (EC)
*        Modified interface for sc2ast_createwcs
*     2007-04-30 (BDK) this file now contains more than just the
*                prototypes, so include sc2ast_pro.h. This allows the
*                prototypes to be created in the data acquisition
*                system, but this is hidden from smurf.
