*  Name:
*     smf_accumulate_prov

*  Purpose:
*     Store file provenance from Grp information using smf_updateprov

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     smf_accumulate_prov( const smfData * data, const Grp * igrp,
*                    int index, int ondf, const char * creator, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     data = const smfData* (Given)
*        Input file from which provenance should be obtained. If no
*        NDF identifier is present the Grp will be used. Can be NULL.
*     igrp = const Grp * (Given)
*        NDG group identifier. Not used if the "data" struct contains
*        an NDF identifier.
*     index = int (Given)
*        Index corresponding to required file in group of Grp is used.
*     ondf = int (Given)
*        Output NDF identifier.
*     creator = const char * (Given)
*        String to associate with the provenance entry. Usually SMURF:TASKNAME
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to inherited status.

*  Description:
*     This function incrementally updates the provenance information in
*     an output file based on an input provenance. It is a small wrapper
*     around smf_updateprov because when raw data are read using sc2store
*     functions the input NDF identifier is not present in the smfData
*     struct and so the input file must be reopened. If the smfData contains
*     an NDF identifier the input file will not be reopened.

*  History:
*     2007-07-05 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version.
*     2007-07-06 (TIMJ):
*        Strip path from filename
*     2008-05-28 (TIMJ):
*        Now a wrapper around smf_updateprov
*     {enter_further_changes_here}

*  Notes:
*     - See smf_fits_add_prov for a routine on adding provenance information
*     to the output FITS header.
