*  Name:
*     smf_fits_export2DA

*  Purpose:
*     Convert AstFitsChan FITS headers to character array

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_fits_export2DA ( const AstFitsChan *fitschan, size_t *ncards, 
*                          char *fitsrec, 
*                          int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     fitschan = const AstFitsChan* (Given)
*        AstFitsChan containing FITS headers
*     ncards = size_T* (Returned)
*        Number of cards in FITS header
*     fitsrec = char* (Returned)
*        Character array for converted FITS headers. This should be large enough
*        to hold SC2STORE__MAXFITS headers.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine converts the contents of an AstFitsChan
*     into a character array for storage by the SCUBA-2 DA system.

*     Tim Jenness (TIMJ)

*  History:
*     2006-11-01 (JB):
*        Original version
*     2007-10-22 (TIMJ):
*        Tweak for new sc2store interface.
*     2007-10-31 (TIMJ):
*        Use size_t to match sc2store.
