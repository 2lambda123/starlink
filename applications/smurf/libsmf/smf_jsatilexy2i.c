*  Name:
*     smf_jsatilexy2i

*  Purpose:
*     Convert the (x,y) indices of a sky tile into a scalar tile index.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     int smf_jsatilexy2i( int xt, int yt, smfJSATiling *skytiling, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     xt = int (Given)
*        The zero-based index of the tile in the X (RA) direction.
*     yt = int (Given)
*        The zero-based index of the tile in the Y (Dec) direction.
*     skytiling = smfJSATiling * (Given)
*        Pointer to a structure holding parameters describing the tiling
*        scheme used for the required JCMT instrument, as returned by
*        function smf_jsatiling.
*     status = int * (Given)
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The zero-based scalar tile index of the requested tile. VAL__BADI is
*     returned if no tile has the requested X adn Y offsets.

*  Description:
*     This function returns a scalar integer index for a tile which is
*     offfset by given numbers of tiles along the X (RA) and Y (Dec) axes
*     away from the bottom left tile in the all-sky map.
