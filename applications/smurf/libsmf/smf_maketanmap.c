*  Name:
*     smf_maketanmap.c

*  Purpose:
*     Create a tangent plane mapping

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_maketanmap( double lon, double lat, AstMapping *cache[ 2 ],
                      int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     lon = double (Given)
*        Celestial longitude at ref point (rads)
*     lat = double (Given)
*        Celestial latitude at ref point (rads)
*     cache = AstMapping* (Given and Returned)
*        Cached Mappings (supply as NULL on 1st call)
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     The forward transformation of the returned Mapping transforms 
*     cartesian tangent plane offsets in radians, into celestial longitude
*     and latitude values, in radians. The reference point of the tangent
*     plane is put at the supplied longitude and latitude position. It is
*     assumed that the second cartesian input axis is parallel to celestial
*     north.

*     The "cache" array should be filled with NULL values before the first
*     call to this function. It will be returned holding AST pointers to
*     Mappings which will be needed on subsequent calls (these pointers are
*     exempted from AST context handling).

*     D.S.Berry (dsb@ast.man.ac.uk)

     a suitable MatrixMap which rotates the tangent point to the requested
     spherical (az,el) coordinates, followed by the "cache[ 0 ]" Mapping. 
     The logic follows that of FITS-WCS paper II (which is what the WcsMap
     class assumes). The reference point of the TAN projection is at the 
     north pole of the "native" spherical coordinate system. The matrix map
     first rotates about the Y axis by (pi/2-lat) (to rotate the reference 
     point from the native north pole to the celestial north pole), then 
     rotates about the Z axis by -lon (to rotate the prime native meridian 
     to the prime celestial meridian). Here the Z axis points to the north
     pole, the X axis points to (lon,lat)=(0,0) and the Y axis points to 
     (lon,lat) = (90 degs,0) (the slalib convention). */
