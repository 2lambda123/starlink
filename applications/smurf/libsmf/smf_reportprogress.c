*  Name:
*     smf_reportprogress

*  Purpose:
*     Report progress.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     void smf_reportprogress( int max, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     max = int (Given)
*        Should be supplied non-zero only on the first call to this 
*        function. It gives the number of calls to this function that
*        corresponds to 100% of the job done. On subsequent calls it
*        should be supplied as zero. Supplying a non-zero value causes 
*        the internal counter to be reset to zero.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Inherited status value. 

*  Description:
*     This function counts the number of times it has been invoked since
*     the previous invocation with a non-zero "max" value. On each
*     invocation it display this count as a percentage of the "max" value.
*     It uses VT100 escape sequences to update the previously displayed
*     figure.
*
*     All text is displayed at the "verbose" MSG information level.
