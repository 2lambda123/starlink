*  Name:
*     smf_create_smfFile

*  Purpose:
*     Allocate a smfFile structure

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     pntr = smf_create_smfFile( int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Return Value:
*     smf_create_smfFile = smfFile*
*        Pointer to newly created smfFile. NULL on error.

*  Description:
*     This function allocates memory for a smfFile structure and
*     all the internal structures. The structure is initialised.

*  Notes:
*     - Free this memory using smf_close_file, via a smfData structure.
*     - Can be freed with a smf_free if file resources are freed first.

*  History:
*     2006-01-26 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version.
*     2006-01-27 (TIMJ):
*        No longer have xloc member
*     2007-06-14 (EC):
*        Initialize DIMMbuf, DIMMfd and DIMMlen for DIMM model components
*     2007-06-25 (EC):
*        Simplified removed DIMMbuf/DIMMlen, renamed DIMMfd to fd.
