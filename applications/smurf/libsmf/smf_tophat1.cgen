*  Name:
*     smf_tophat1<X>

*  Purpose:
*     Smoothes a 1-D array with a top-hat filter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     void smf_tophat1<X>( CGEN_TYPE *data, int nel,
*                          int box, unsigned char *qual,
*                          unsigned char mask, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     data = CGEN_TYPE * (Given)
*        Pointer to the 1D array to be smoothed.
*     nel = const int (Given)
*        Number of points in the input data.
*     box = int (Given)
*        The size of the top-hat filter box (in array elements). If an
*        even number is supplied, the next higher odd number is used.
*     qual = unsigned char * (Given)
*        If specified, use this QUALITY array to decide which samples
*        to use (see "mask"). Otherwise data are only ignored if set
*        to VAL__BAD<X>.
*     mask = unsigned char (Given)
*        Use with qual to define which bits in quality are relevant to
*        ignore data in the calculation.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine replaces each element of the supplied 1D array with
*     the mean of the neighbouring elements in a box of width "box". It
*     takes special care handling bad pixels, since a biased mean value
*     can be created if there are different numbers of bad pixels in each
*     half of the filter box. For instance, if the top half of the filter
*     box contains more bad pixels than the bottom half, then the output
*     mean value will be biased towards the data values in the bottom half.
*
*     This extra checking results in smf_tophat1 being slower than
*     smf_boxcar1.
