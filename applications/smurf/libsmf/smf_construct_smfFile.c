*  Name:
*     smf_construct_smfFile

*  Purpose:
*     (Optionally) Create and Populate a smfFile structure

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     file = smf_construct_smfFile( smfFile * tofill, int ndfid,int isSc2store,
*                 int isTstream, const char * name, HDSLoc* xloc, 
*                 int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     tofill = smfFile* (Given)
*        If non-null, the remaining arguments to this function
*        are assigned to this struct and no struct is malloced.
*        This can be used to fill a previously malloced struct.
*     ndfid = int (Given)
*        NDF identifier
*     isSc2store = int (Given)
*        True if the file is under "sc2store" control.
*     isTstream = int (Given)
*        True if ths file is time series data.
*     name = const char * (Given)
*        File name. Can be NULL. Contents are copied.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Return Value:
*     smf_create_smfFile = smfFile*
*        Pointer to newly created and populated smfFile. NULL on malloc error.
*        If "tofill" was non-NULL on entry, the pointer returned is the
*        pointer to this struct. This pointer will be returned even if
*        status is bad.

*  Description:
*     This function allocates memory for a smfFile structure and
*     all the internal structures. The structure is initialised
*     with the supplied values.

*  Notes:
*     - If the smfFile is supplied by the caller, make sure that
*       there are no active File resources that need freeing first. They
*       will be overwritten.
*     - Free this memory using smf_close_file, via a smfData structure.
*     - Can be freed with a smf_free if file resources are freed first.
*     - See also smf_create_smfFile
