*  Name:
*     smf_terr

*  Purpose:
*     Convert geodetic lat/long to a terrestrial Cartesian (x,y,z) position

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "smf.h"
*     void smf_terr( double phi, double h, double lambda, double pos[3] )


*  Description:
*     This function converts a geodetic longitude, latitude and height
*     above the reference spheroid into a terrestrial Cartesian
*     position (x,y,z). The (x,y,z) system has origin at the centre of
*     the earth, Z axis going through the north pole, X axis at
*     (long,lat)=(0,0), and Y axis at (long,lat) = (E90,0).
*     This function is the inverse of smf_geod.

*  Parameters:
*     phi
*        Geodetic latitude in radians.
*     h
*        Height above the reference spheroid (geodetic, metres).
*     lambda
*        Geodetic longitude, in radians, positive east.
*     pos
*        Array holding the returned (x,y,z) values, in metres.
