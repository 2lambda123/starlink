*  Name:
*     smf_telpos_get

*  Purpose:
*     High-level routine that calculates/stores the geodetic position of
*     a telescope (telpos) in a smfHead given information in its FITS header

*  Invocation:
*     smf_telpos_get( smfHead *hdr, int * status );

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Description:
*     Uses the header information to determine the position of the telescope. 

*  Arguments:
*     hdr = smfHead* (Given & Returned)
*        Header information.
*     status = int* (Given & Returned)
*        Inherited status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Status is not set to bad if the telpos cannote be determined
*     -  If no fitshdr is attached, telpos is not altered

*  Authors:
*     EC: Edward Chapin (UBC)

*  History:
*     06-SEPT-2006 (EC):
*        Original version.
*     11-NOV-2006 (EC):
*        Modified by DB, but small error fixed in case where OBSGEO undefined
*     17-DEC-2008 (TIMJ):
*        Allow for an undefined OBSGEO. Retrieve obsgeo values as double
*        rather than float.
