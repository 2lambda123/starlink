*  Name:
*     smf_qual_str

*  Purpose:
*     Return a string name for a given quality bit

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     const char *smf_qual_str( smf_qfam_t family, int usebit, int bit_or_val,
*                  const char **descr, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     family = smf_qfam_t (Given)
*        Indicate which family of quality bits is represented in "qual".
*     usebit = int (Given)
*        If true "bit is used to determine the relevant quality. Else
*        "val" is used.
*     bit_or_val = int (Given)
*        If "usebit" is true this is a bit number in the range 0 to SMF__NQBITS-1.
*        Else it is the actual quality value to be tested.
*     descr = const char ** (Given)
*        Pointer to const string buffer describing the quality. Can be NULL.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Return Value:
*     const char* = Pointer to constant string corresponding to data type.
*                   Can be NULL pointer if type unknown.

*  Description:
*     This function returns a string name corresponding to the given quality
*     Bit or quality value. It can also be used to obtain a string description
*     of what the quality represents. Returns NULL pointer if outside
*     the allowable range.
*
*     The values returned depend on the quality family being requested. For
*     example we could be interested in time series quality or map quality.

*  Authors:
*     Edward Chapin (UBC)
*     Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  Notes:
*     Must keep in sync with smf_qual_str_to_val and smf_typ.h, and ensure that
*     the string representations do not exceed SMF_QSTR_MAX characters.

*  History:
*     2010-03-18 (EC):
*        Initial version, copied from smf_dtype_str.c
*     2010-03-19 (EC):
*        Rename SMF__Q_BADS to SMF__Q_BADDA, and added SMF__Q_COM
*     2010-06-17 (TIMJ):
*        Change API to allow the description to be in the same place
*        as the string identifier. Also allow a value to be given directly
*        as well as an alternative to the bit number.
*     2010-06-17 (TIMJ):
*        Add quality family.
*     2010-07-06 (TIMJ):
*        Add SMF__Q_NOISE
*     2011-04-15 (TIMJ):
*        Add SMF__Q_EXT
