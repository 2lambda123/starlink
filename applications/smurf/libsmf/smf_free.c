*  Name:
*     smf_free

*  Purpose:
*     Low-level SMURF free

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_free( void * pntr, int * status );

*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This is the SMURF free routine. It should be used in preference
*     to system free() and should be paired with a SMURF allocation routine
*     (smf_malloc).
