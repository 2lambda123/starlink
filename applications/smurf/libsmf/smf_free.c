*  Name:
*     smf_free

*  Purpose:
*     Low-level SMURF free

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     pntr = smf_free( void * pntr, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     pntr = void * (Given)
*        Memory location to be freed.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:

*     This is the SMURF free routine. It should be used in preference
*     to system free() and should be paired with a SMURF allocation
*     routine (smf_malloc). If the free was successful a null pointer
*     is returned, else the original.

*  History:
*     2006-01-25 (TIMJ):
*        Original version.

*     2007-12-14 (AGG):
