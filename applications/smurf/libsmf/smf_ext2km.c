*  Name:
*     smf_ext2km

*  Purpose:
*     Copy the time-indexed extension items into an AST KeyMap.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     void smf_ext2km( int indf, const char *xname, AstKeyMap *keymap, 
*                      int mode, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     indf = int (Given)
*        An NDF identifier for the NDF containing the extension items 
*        to be read. This should be a time series file spanned by
*        (spectrum,receptor,time slice) axes. It should contain ACSIS and
*        JCMTSTATE extensions.
*     xname = const char * (Given)
*        The name of the NDF extension to read.
*     mode = int (Given)
*        Determines what data is copied from the NDF, and whether it
*        over-writes any existing data in the KeyMap or is appended to
*        the end of any existing data.
*
*        1 - Copy all suitable arrays from the named extension into the 
*        KeyMap, erasing any existing entries with the same name.
*
*        2 - Only copy extension items that already have an entry in the 
*        KeyMap, appending the new values to the end of the existing
*        values. An error is reported if new data cannot be found in the
*        NDF for any of the existing entries in the KeyMap.
*     keymap = AstKeyMap * (Given)
*        An AST keyMap to hold the primitive array values read from the
*        NDF extension.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Inherited status value. 

*  Description:
*     This function copies values from a named NDF extension into the 
*     supplied KeyMap. Each entry in the KeyMap has a key that is equal 
*     to the name of the extension component, and a value that is a
*     vectorised list of the values read from the extension component.
*
*     The named extension is searched for primitive array components
*     that have a final trailing axis length equal to the length of the 
*     NDFs 3rd pixel axis. An additional constraint is that if "xname" is
*     ACSIS, only arrays with at least 2 axes are used. Any such arrays are 
*     vectorised and stored in the KeyMap, in the manner determined by the 
*     "mode" argument.

*  Authors:
*     David S Berry (JAC, UCLan)

*  History:
*     11-MAR-2008 (DSB):
*        Initial version.
*     14-APR-2008 (DSB):
*        Only copy ACSIS arrays that have at least 2 axes. This guards
*        against problems if the number of time slices is equal to the 
*        number of detectors.
