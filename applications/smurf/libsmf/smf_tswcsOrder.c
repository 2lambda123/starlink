*  Name:
*     smf_tswcsOrder

*  Purpose:
*     Re-order the axes in a time series WCS FrameSet

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     smf_tswcsOrder( AstFrameSet **tswcs, int isTordered, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     tswcs = AstKeyMap* (Given and Returned)
*        Address of a pointer to the FrameSet to be modified. The pointer
*        may be modified on exit to refer to a new modified FrameSet.
*     isTordered = int (Given)
*        Should the returned FrameSet be time-ordered?
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     If "isTordered" is non-zero, then this function checks to see if
*     the third axis in the current Frame of the supplied FrameSet is a
*     time axis. If it is, it returns without action. If it is not, it
*     reorders the axes to ensure that the third WCS axis is time axis.
*
*     If "isTordered" is zero, then this function checks to see if
*     the first axis in the current Frame of the supplied FrameSet is a
*     time axis. If it is, it returns without action. If it is not, it
*     reorders the axes to ensure that the first WCS axis is time axis.
