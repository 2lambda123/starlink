*  Name:
*     smf_construct_smfHead

*  Purpose:
*     Populate a smfHead structure

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     pntr = smf_construct_smfHead( smfHead * tofill, inst_t instrument,
*              AstFrameSet * wcs, AstFrameSet * tswcs,
*              AstFitsChan * fitshdr, const JCMTState * allState,
*              dim_t curframe, smf_obsmode obsmode, smf_swmode swmode,
*              smf_obstype obstype, smf_obstype seqtype, smf_inbeam_t inbeam,
*              unsigned int ndet, const double fplanex[], const double fplaney[],
*              const double detpos[], const char *detname, int dpazel,
*              const double tsys[],
*              const char title[], const char dlabel[], const char units[],
*              const double telpos[], char *ocsconfig,
*              const char obsidss[], int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     tofill = smfHead* (Given)
*        If non-NULL, this is the smfHead that is populated by the remaining
*        arguments. If NULL, the smfHead is malloced.
*     instrument = inst_t (Given)
*        Instrument code. Can be INST__NONE.
*     wcs = AstFrameSet * (Given)
*        Frameset for the world coordinates. The pointer is copied,
*        not the contents.
*     tswcs = AstrFrameSet * (Given)
*        Frameset for the time series world coordinates. The pointer is copied,
*        not the contents.
*     fitshdr = AstFitsChan * (Given)
*        FITS header. The pointer is copied, not the contents.
*     allState = JCMTState* (Given)
*        Pointer to array of time series information for all time slices.
*        Should be at least "curslice" in size. Contents are not copied but it is
*        assumed that the memory will be owned by this smfHead.
*     curframe = dim_t (Given)
*        Current time index corresponding to the associated WCS. sc2head
*        will be set to this location.
*     nframes = dim_t (Given)
*        Number of frames (timeslices) in data.
*     obsmode = smf_obsmode (Given)
*        Observing mode.
*     swmode = smf_swmode (Given)
*        Switching mode.
*     obstype = smf_obstype (Given)
*        Observation type
*     seqtype = smf_obstype (Given)
*        Sequence type
*     inbeam = smf_inbeam_t (Given)
*        What is in the beam
*     ndet = unsigned int (Given)
*        Number of positions in fplanex, fplaney arrays. Number of detectors.
*     fplanex = const double[] (Given)
*        X Coordinates of bolometers/receptors in the focal plane (radians)
*     fplanex = const double[] (Given)
*        Y Coordinates of bolometers/receptors in the focal plane (radians)
*     detpos = const double[] (Given)
*        The position of the bolometers/receptors in tracking coordinates,
*        in radians. This array should have a length of 2*ndet*nframes.
*     detname = const char * (Given)
*        A concatenated list of null-terminated detector names.
*     dpazel = int (Given)
*        If non-zero, then the values in "detpos" are AZEL
*        positions. Otherwise they are TRACKING positions.
*     tsys = const double[] (Given)
*        System temperatures for each receptor
*     title = const char[] (Given)
*        Title associated with header.
*     dlabel = const char[] (Given)
*        Data label associated with header.
*     units = const char[] (Given)
*        Data units.
*     telpos = const double[] (Given)
*        The telscope position.
*     ocsconfig = char * (Given)
*        OCS Configuration XML
*     obsidss = const char [] (Given)
*        Observation subsystem identifier.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Return Value:
*     smf_construct_smfHead = smfHead*
*        Pointer to newly created smfHead (NULL on error) or,
*        if "tofill" is non-NULL, the pointer to the supplied struct.

*  Description:
*     This function fills a smfHead structure. Optionally, the smfHead
*     is allocated by this routines.

*  Notes:
*     - AST objects are neither cloned nor copied by this routine.
*       Use astCopy or astClone when calling if reference counts
*       should be incremented.
*     - "state" is set to point into allState[curslice]
*     - It is assumed that any array pointers supplied to this routine
*       (allState, fplanex, ocsconfig etc) will become owned by this
*       struct. If this is not the case set isCloned to true when the
*       smfHead is constructed. Note that if any of them are to be owned
*       by the struct all of them must be owned by the struct since
*       smf_close_file will assume this.
*     - Free this memory using smf_close_file, via a smfData structure.
*     - Can be freed with a smf_free if header resources are freed first.
*     - obsidss, units, data label and title are copied into this header and will
*       not be freed (they are a defined part of the struct, not dynamic memory).
*     - ocsconfig is assigned to this struct and not copied. It is assumed
*       to be dynamic memory.
