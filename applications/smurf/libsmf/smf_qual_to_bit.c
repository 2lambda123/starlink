*  Name:
*     smf_qual_to_bit

*  Purpose:
*     Convert a quality value to a 0-indexed bit number

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     int smf_qual_to_bit( smf_qual_t q, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     q = smf_qual_t (Given)
*        Quality value to test.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     The bit number. -1 if no bits are set. Returns 0 if status
*     is bad on entry (so that it is safe to use the return value
*     as an array index even if status is bad but you know the bit
*     would be defined because a constant is passed in).

*  Description:
*     Converts a quality value (e.g. SMF__Q_BADB) to the corresponding
*     bit number. The first bit is at position zero. If multiple bits
*     are set this function will return the position of the first.

*  History:
*     2010-06-16 (TIMJ):
