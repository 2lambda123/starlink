*  Name:
*     smf_construct_smfData

*  Purpose:
*     Populate a smfData structure

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     pntr = smf_construct_smfData( smfData * tofill, smfFile * file,
*                      smfHead * hdr, smfDA * da, smf_dtype dtype,
*                      void * pntr[2], smf_qual_t qual, smf_qfam_t qfamily,
*                      smfData * sidequal, int isTordered, const dim_t dims[],
*                      const int lbnd[], int ndims, int virtual, int ncoeff,
*                      double * poly, AstKeyMap * history, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     tofill = smfData * (Given)
*        If NULL, a new smfData is created (only the smfData is malloced,
*        components are read in from the arguments). If non-NULL the
*        supplied smfData is modified in place.
*     file = smfFile * (Given)
*        Pointer to smfFile struct to associate with the smfData struct.
*        If NULL, this argument is ignored. If the smfData that receives
*        this is non-NULL, then an error is triggered (since there may
*        be unfreed resources).
*     hdr = smfHead * (Given)
*        Pointer to smfHead to associate with the smfData struct. See
*        "file" for rules on when this will be assigned.
*     da = smfDA * (Given)
*        Pointer to smfDa. Same behaviour as "hdr" and "file".
*     dtype = smf_dtype (Given)
*        Data type of this smfData.
*     pntr[2] = void* (Given)
*        Array of pointers to data and variance. Pointers will
*        be copied from this array. Can be NULL if you want to defer assigning
*        pointers to the smfData.
*     qual = smf_qual_t (Given)
*        Pointer to quality. Pointer will be copied. Can be NULL.
*     qfamily = smf_qfam_t (Given)
*        Quality family used in "qual".
*     sidequal = smfData * (Given)
*        Override external quality that can be used in preference to "qual".
*        This pointer will be copied and it is assumed that the smfData
*        will be freed in another location. See smf_select_qualpntr to determine
*        which pointer to use for quality.
*     isTordered = int (Given)
*        If set, data is ICD-compliant time-ordered. Otherwise bolom-ordered.
*     dims[] = const dim_t (Given)
*        Array of dimensions. Values will be copied from this array.
*     lbnd[] = const dim_t (Given)
*        Lower pixel bounds of the data. Defaults to 1 for each ndim axis if
*        NULL pointer provided. Values will be copied from this array.
*     ndims = int (Given)
*        Number of dimensions in dims[]. Maximum of NDF__MXDIM.
*     virtual = int (Given)
*        Boolean indicating whether this is a virtual smfData.
*     ncoeff = int (Given)
*        Number of coefficients in scanfit polynomial
*     poly = double * (Given)
*        Pointer to array of polynomial coefficients
*     history = AstKeyMap * (Given)
*        history tracking. Will not be copied or cloned by the routine.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Return Value:
*     smf_construct_smfData = smfData*
*        Pointer to newly created smfData. NULL on error.

*  Description:
*     This function (optionally) allocates memory for a smfData structure and
*     copies in the supplied values. If an existing struct is supplied it is
*     filled by this routine.

*  Notes:
*     - refcount will be set to 1 in this routine.
*     - The pntr[] and qual pointers are copied and will be owned by the smfData.
*       Do not free them independently.
*     - Free this memory using smf_close_file
*     - Data arrays are not populated by this routine. The pointers
*       are set to NULL.
*     - The associated smfDream is currently left NULL (as returned
*       from the call to smf_create_smfData)
