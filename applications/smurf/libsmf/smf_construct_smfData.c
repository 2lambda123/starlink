*  Name:
*     smf_construct_smfData

*  Purpose:
*     Populate a smfData structure

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     pntr = smf_construct_smfData( smfData * tofill, smfFile * file, 
*                      smfHead * hdr, 
*		       smfDA * da, smf_dtype dtype, void * pntr[3], 
*		       const dim_t dims[], int ndims,
*		       int virtual, int ncoeff, double *poly, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     tofill = smfData * (Given)
*        If NULL, a new smfData is created (only the smfData is malloced,
*        components are read in from the arguments). If non-NULL the
*        supplied smfData is modified in place.
*     file = smfFile * (Given)
*        Pointer to smfFile struct to associate with the smfData struct.
*        If NULL, this argument is ignored. If the smfData that receives
*        this is non-NULL, then an error is triggered (since there may
*        be unfreed resources).
*     hdr = smfHead * (Given)
*        Pointer to smfHead to associate with the smfData struct. See
*        "file" for rules on when this will be assigned.
*     da = smfDA * (Given)
*        Pointer to smfDa. Same behaviour as "hdr" and "file".
*     dtype = smf_dtype (Given)
*        Data type of this smfData.
*     pntr[3] = void* (Given)
*        Array of pointers to data, variance and quality. Pointers will
*        be copied from this array.
*     dims[] = dim_t (Given)
*        Array of dimensions. Values will be copied from this array.
*     ndims = int (Given)
*        Number of dimensions in dims[]. Maximum of NDF__MXDIM.
*     virtual = int (Given)
*        Boolean indicating whether this is a virtual smfData.
*     ncoeff = int (Given)
*        Number of coefficients in scanfit polynomial
*     poly = double * (Given)
*        Pointer to array of polynomial coefficients
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Return Value:
*     smf_construct_smfData = smfData*
*        Pointer to newly created smfData. NULL on error.

*  Description:
*     This function (optionally) allocates memory for a smfData structure and
*     copies in the supplied values. If an existing struct is supplied it is
*     filled by this routine.

*  Notes:
*     - refcount will be set to 1 in this routine.
*     - If the pntr[] data arrays are malloced, there will be a memory
*       leak if new values are copied in.
*     - Free this memory using smf_close_file
*     - Data arrays are not populated by this routine. The pointers
*       are set to NULL.
