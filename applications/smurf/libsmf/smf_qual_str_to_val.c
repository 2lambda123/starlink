*  Name:
*     smf_qual_str_to_val

*  Purpose:
*     Translate a quality name into a SMURF quality value and family

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_qual_t smf_qual_str_to_val( const char *qname, smf_qfam_t * family, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     qname = const char * (Given)
*        Quality name (as returned by smf_qual_str)
*     family = smf_qfam_t * (Returned)
*        Quality family associated with this quality name. Can be NULL.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     Quality value corresponding to the supplied QNAME.
*     Returns 0 if none could be found and also sets
*     status to bad in that case.

*  Description:
*     Translates a quality name as defined in smf_qual_str into a
*     a value and, optionally, a quality family.

*  Authors:
*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  Notes:
*     Must keep in sync with smf_qual_str and smf_typ.h, and ensure that
*     the string representations do not exceed SMF_QSTR_MAX characters.

*  History:
*     2010-06-17 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version
*     2010-07-06 (TIMJ):
*        Add SMF__Q_NOISE
*     2011-04-15 (TIMJ):
