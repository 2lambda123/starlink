*  Name:
*     smf_scanfit

*  Purpose:
*     Open files and apply flatfield correction as necessary

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     SMURF subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_scanfit( smfData *data, unsigned char *quality, int order, 
*                  int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     data = smfData* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to a pointer to smfData struct containing flatfielded data.
*        Will be created by this routine, or NULL on error.
*     quality = unsigned char * (Given)
*        If set, use this buffer instead of QUALITY associated with data.
*        If NULL, use the QUALITY associated with data. 
*     order = int (Given)
*        Order of polynomial to be fitted
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This task carries out and stores a polynomial fit to the
*     bolometer time streams, which can then be used for sky
*     subtraction. Errors are printed if the polynomial order is
*     either negative or greater than the number of points (minus 1).

*  Notes:
*     Non-integer values for the order are truncated.

*  Authors:
*     Andy Gibb (UBC)
*     Ed Chapin (UBC)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     2006-05-02 (AGG):
*        Initial version, stripped out code from original simulator
*        version
*     2006-05-15 (AGG):
*        - Checks for valid values of the polynomial order
*        - Now calls new smf_fit_poly routine
*     2008-03-25 (EC):
*        - Remove history check for extinction
*        - Handle both time and bolo-ordered data
*        - If smfData unassociated with file, just malloc poly buffer
*        - on exit, data->poly contains fitted coeff
*     2008-04-03 (EC):
*        - Added quality to interface
*     2008-12-03 (TIMJ):
*        Use smf_get_dims
