*  Name:
*     smf_check_flat

*  Purpose:
*     Low-level routine to check if data are flatfielded

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     SMURF subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_check_flat( const smfData *data, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     data = const smfData* (Given)
*        Pointer to a smfData struct
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:

*     This subroutine determines whether the data have been
*     flatfielded by testing for the existence of the da component in
*     the smfData struct, and if the data type is double. Returns a
*     status of SMF__FLATN if either is true.

*  Authors:
*     Andy Gibb (UBC)

*  History:
*     2005-12-05 (AGG):
*        Initial version.
*     2005-12-12 (AGG):
*        Update API prototype to reflect const input struct
*     2006-01-25 (AGG):
*        Minor change to logic on checking existence of smfDA
*     2006-03-29 (AGG):
*        Add check on data type
