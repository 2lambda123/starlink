*  Name:
*     smf_fits_outhdr

*  Purpose:
*     Form output file FITS header from unique content of input files

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     smf_fits_outhdr( const AstFitsChan * inhdr, AstFitsChan ** outhdr,
*                    AstKeyMap ** obsidmap, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     inhdr = const AstFitsChan * (Given)
*        FITS header to be merged.
*     outhdr = AstFitsChan ** (Given & Returned)
*        Output FITS header. *outhdr should be NULL for the first
*        call to this routine (it will then be populated with a copy of
*        the first inhdr).
*     obsidmap = AstKeyMap ** (Given & Returned)
*        Keymap for tracking OBSID information. *obsidmap hould be NULL for the
*        first call to this routine.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This function is used to build up an output FITS header (as a 
*     FitsChan) by merging content from all the input FITS headers.
*     Values in the FITS headers that differ are removed. It
*     should be called once for each input FITS header. Additionally, the
*     routine keeps track of all the OBSIDs present in the input FITS headers
*     such that the input data sets can be tracked into the output file
*     (very important for data provenance tracking).

*     Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
*     David Berry (JAC, UCLan)
*     Brad Cavanagh (JAC, Hawaii)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     2007-03-20 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version. Refactored from code by David Berry
*        and Brad Cavanagh from smurf_makecube.c
*     2007-06-22 (TIMJ):
*        Use OBSIDSS in preference to OBSID. Try to build OBSID from
*        OBSID and SUBSYSNR if OBSID is missing.

*  Notes:
*     - See smf_fits_add_prov for a routine on adding provenance information
*     to the output FITS header.
