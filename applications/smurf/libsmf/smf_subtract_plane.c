*  Name:
*     smf_subtract_plane

*  Purpose:
*     Wrapper for low-level sky fitting and removal routine

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_subtract_plane( smfData *data, smfArray *array, 
*                         const char *fittype, int *status ) 

*  Arguments:
*     data = smfData* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to input data struct, can be NULL
*     array = smfArray* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to input array of related data structs, can be NULL
*     fittype = char* (Given)
*        Fit-type for PLANE sky-removal method
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine is a wrapper to select the desired sky subtraction
*     method when the PLANE method is specified in smurf_remsky. The
*     choice is determined by which input is set to NULL. If both are
*     NULL then an error is issued. No check is made to see if both
*     are valid pointers but in this case smf_subtract_plane1 will be
*     called by default as its non-NULL status is checked first.
*
*     Alternatively, the lower-level routines may be called directly
*     as each one is self-contained.

*  History:
*     2006-02-24 (AGG):
*        Initial test version
*     2006-10-12 (AGG):
*        New version to act as wrapper for lower-level routines. See
*        smf_subtract_plane1.c for original incarnation of this file.
