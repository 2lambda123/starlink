/*

*  Name:
*     smf_groupscans

*  Purpose:
*     Group time series NDFs according to OBSID, SUBSYSNR and NSUBSCAN.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     AstKeyMap *smf_groupscans( Grp *igrp,  int size, int *maxsyspop,
*                                int *conform, Grp **ogrp, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     igrp = Grp * (Given)
*        Group of input NDFs.
*     size = int (Given)
*        Number of elements in igrp
*     maxsyspop = int * (Returned)
*        Returned holding the largest number of NDFs that refer to the 
*        same observation and sub-system.
*     conform = int * (Returned)
*        Returned non-zero if all the input NDFs have names that conform
*        to the naming convention for ACSIS raw time series files.
*     ogrp = Grp ** (Returned)
*        Location at which to return a pointer to a new GRP group. This
*        group holds the names of the first input NDF related to each 
*        set of related sub-scans (i.e. sub-scans for the same observation
*        and sub-system). They are ordered in the same order that the
*        sub-scans would be accessed if the nested KeyMaps returned by this
*        function are traversed using the order of keys defined by astMapKey.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the AST KeyMap.

*  Description:
*     This function classifies each NDF in the supplied group using the
*     values for the OBSID, SUBSYSNR and NSUBSCAN keywords in the FITS 
*     extension. It returns a pointer to an AST KeyMap containing entries
*     for each OBSID value found in the specified NDFs. Each of these
*     entries has a key equal to the OBSID value, and a value which is a
*     pointer to another AST KeyMap containing information about the NDFs 
*     that have the OBSID value. Each of these subsiduary KeyMaps has an
*     entry for each SUBSYSNR value found for the OBSID value. The key is
*     the SUBSYSNR value, and the entry is a pointer to another KeyMap
*     containing information about the NDFs that have the SUBSYSNR and
*     OBSID values. Each of these KeyMaps has an entry for each NSUBSCAN
*     value, the key being the NSUBSCAN value and the value being the
*     integer (one-based) index of the NDF within "igrp".

*  Authors:
*     David S Berry (JAC, UCLan)

*  History:
*     17-MAR-2008 (DSB):
*        Initial version.
*     27-MAR-2008 (DSB):
*        Use smf_getobsidss to get the OBSIDSS value, and then split it
*        up into OBSID and SUBSYSNR.
