*  Name:
*     smf_boxcar1<X>

*  Purpose:
*     Low-level routine to smooth a 1-D array with a boxcar filter

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     void smf_boxcar1<X>( CGEN_TYPE *series, const size_t ninpts,
*                          size_t window, smf_qual_t *qual,
*                          smf_qual_t mask, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     series = CGEN_TYPE* (Given)
*        Pointer to array that will be smoothed
*     ninpts = const size_t (Given)
*        Number of points in input series
*     window = size_t (Given)
*        Size of boxcar filter window (in array elements)
*     qual = smf_qual_t* (Given)
*        If specified, use this QUALITY array to decide which samples
*        to use (provided mask). Otherwise data are only ignored if set
*        to VAL__BADD.
*     mask = smf_qual_t (Given)
*        Use with qual to define which bits in quality are relevant to
*        ignore data in the calculation.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine performs an in-place boxcar average of an input
*     array over a given window, replacing values in the array with
*     the appropriate average value. If the window size exceeds the
*     size of the input array then the routine will replace the array
*     values with the mean of the entire array. The half-windows at
*     the start and end are filled with smoothed values over shortened
*     intervals (smoothly changes from WINDOW to 1 sample in length).

*  History:
*     2006-05-26 (AGG):
*        Initial test version
*     2006-10-11 (AGG):
*        Change int arguments to size_t
*     2007-06-27 (EC):
*        Changed algorithm to calculate a "smooth" boxcar (old algorithm
*        assigned same smooth value to all samples within disjoint windows)
*     2007-12-18 (AGG):
*        Update to use new smf_free behaviour
*     2008-04-14 (EC):
*        -added QUALITY masking
*        -algorithm now smooths with shortened intervals at array ends
*     2008-06-25 (EC):
*        -Only evaluate smooth values with good QUALITY / not VAL__BADD
*     2008-08-28 (EC):
*        Re-written as a generic function
*     2010-05-28 (TIMJ):
*        size_t can't go negative so "off" must be a long and when copying
*        from i and window we need to cast to long before negating.
