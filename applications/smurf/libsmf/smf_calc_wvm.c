*  Name:
*     smf_calc_wvm

*  Purpose:
*     Function to calculate the optical depth from the raw WVM data

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_calc_wvm( const smfHead *hdr, int *status) {

*  Arguments:
*     hdr = smfHead* (Given)
*        Header struct from data struct
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the optical depth for the given SCUBA-2
*     filter based on the raw temperature info from the WVM. 

*  Notes:
*     - Returns a value of VAL__BADD if status is set bad on entry
*     - See also smf_scale_tau.c for scaling between filters/wavelengths

*  Authors:
*     Andy Gibb (UBC)
*     Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     2006-02-03 (AGG):
*        Initial test version
*     2006-07-26 (TIMJ):
*        sc2head no longer used. Use JCMTState instead.
