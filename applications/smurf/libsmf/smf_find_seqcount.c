*  Name:
*     smf_find_subarray

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the subarray name and number

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     smf_find_subarray( const smfHead * hdr, int * seqcount, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     hdr = const smfHead * (Given)
*        Header from which to obtain the FITS information
*     seqcount = int* (Returned)
*        Pointer to int to contain the sequence count.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This function reads the FITS header to determine the sequence count
*     within the observation. It is a simple wrapper around the fits retrieval.
