*  Name:
*     smf_get_nthread

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the number of threads to use.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     int smf_get_nthread( int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to inherited status.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of threads to use. A value of 1 is returned if an error
*     occurs.

*  Description:
*     This function returns the number of worker threads to use when
*     dividing a task up between multiple threads. Note, a value of "1"
*     means one worker thread in addition to the required manager thread
*     that co-ordinates the workers (i.e. the main thread in which the
*     application is started). The default value is the number
*     of CPU cores available, but this can be over-ridden by setting the
*     environment variable SMURF_THREADS to some other value.

*  Notes:
*     - This function is not in smf_threads.c because it does not make
*     any pthread calls.

*  Authors:
*     David S Berry (JAC, UCLan)
*     Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)

*  History:
*     9-JUN-2008 (DSB):
*        Initial version.
*     29-MAY-2009 (TIMJ):
*        Use sysconf to get number of processors rather than non-portable
*        parsing of /proc. Use strtol instead of sscanf.
