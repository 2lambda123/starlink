*  Name:
*     smf_tslice_ast

*  Purpose:
*     Configure an AST FrameSet for a specified time slice

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     smf_tslice_ast( smfData * data, int index, int needwcs, int * status);

*  Arguments:
*     data = smfData* (Given & Returned)
*        Data structure containing time series data.
*        The smfHead item in the structure will be updated to receive
*        the updated FrameSet. In addition, the sc2head will be populated
*        if this is a time series data file.
*     index = int (Given)
*        Index into the time series data (the 3rd dimension).
*        If the data structure does not contain the specified index
*        a bad error is reported. Ignored for 2D data.
*     needwcs = int (Given)
*        Flag to indicate whether or not a WCS frameset is desired
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This function is used to create an AST FrameSet for the
*     specified time slice from the supplied data structure. It only
*     creates a new frameset if required, else the supplied frameset
*     is modified for efficiency. The FrameSet is stored in the "hdr"
*     component of the supplied data structure. The caller has the
*     option of specifying that they do not need a frameset at all,
*     such as in the case of QUICK LOOK processing.
*
*     For 2D data files the routine returns without modification of
*     the "data" structure if the header struct already contains a
*     frameset.  Bad status is set if a 2D data struct does not
*     contain a frameset already.
*
*     The frameset will be freed automatically when the data struct is
*     annulled.

*  History:
*     2005-11-07 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version.
*     2005-11-08 (TIMJ):
*        For now simply (inefficiently) create a new frameset each time
*        round rather than reusing an existing one.
*     2006-01-26 (TIMJ):
*        sc2head is now embedded in the struct and is therefore mandatory.
*        Use SUBARRAY string rather than SUBSYSNR
*     2006-01-27 (TIMJ):
*        No longer use sc2store. Now index directly into pre-read time
*        series headers.
*     2006-02-08 (AGG):
*        Add needwcs flag to API.
*     2006-02-11 (DSB):
*        Add "extra_frames" parameter to sc2ast_createwcs calls.
*     2006-03-23 (AGG):
*        Store current frame in smfData
*     2006-04-12 (EC):
*        Added jig_az_x/y to createwcs call
*     2006-07-26 (TIMJ):
*        sc2head no longer used. Use JCMTState instead.
*     {enter_further_changes_here}

*  Notes:
*     The API is currently uncertain since it may make more sense to pass in a
*     smfHead rather than a smfData (assuming the xloc field is moved to 
*     smfHead).
