*  Name:
*     smf_request_mask

*  Purpose:
*     Request mask files from parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     SMURF subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_request_mask( ThrWorkForce *wf, const char *param, smfArray ** bbms, int *status);

*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads
*     param = const char * (Given)
*        Name of ADAM parameter to use when requesting bad bolometer mask
*        group of files. Usually "BBM".
*     bbms = smfArray** (Returned)
*        Pointer to smfArray* that will be returned as a valid smfArray
*        if the parameter contained files. If a NULL parameter is given this
*        pointer will be NULL.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Request a group of files from the named parameter, open them and
*     store them all in a smfArray. A null parameter response will result
*     in a null pointer rather than a smfArray.

*  Notes:
*     - Calls kpg1Rgndf to obtain files.
