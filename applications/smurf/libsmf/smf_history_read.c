*  Name:
*     smf_history_read

*  Purpose:
*     Reads the history from an NDF and stores it for querying

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     void smf_history_read( const smfData * data, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     data = const smfData* (Given)
*        Data struct to check. This must be associated with an open
*        file.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status. Will be bad on return if this smfData
*        is not associated with a file.

*  Description:
*     This routine reads the history component for a file associated
*     with the current smfData and stores it in an AstKeyMap. This can
*     then be queried by routines checking whether a particular step
*     has been carried out. Note that the only entries stored in the
*     history are those written by SMURF (starting with SMF_), not the
*     application-level NDF history entries.

*  Authors:
*     Andy Gibb (UBC)

*  History:
*     2006-04-19 (AGG):
*        Initial version, copied from smf_history_check
*     2006-07-05 (AGG):
*        Check for presence of history component before attempting to
*        read

*  Notes:
*     - Checks are made assuming the subroutine names are lower case
*     - See also smf_history_write
