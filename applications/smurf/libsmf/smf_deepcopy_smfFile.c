*  Name:
*     smf_deepcopy_smfFile

*  Purpose:
*     Copy all elements of a smfFile structure

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     new = smf_deepcopy_smfFile( const smfFile *old, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     old = const smfFile* (Given)
*        Pointer to smfFile to be copied
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Return Value:
*     smf_deepcopy_smfFile = smfFile*
*        Pointer to newly created smfFile. NULL on error.

*  Description:
*     This function copies all information from an existing smfFile
*     structure and all the internal structures to a new smfFile
*     structure. The NDF identifier (if present) is cloned.

*  Notes:
*     - Free this memory using smf_close_file, via a smfData structure.

*  Authors:
*     Andy Gibb (UBC)

*  History:
*     2006-03-29 (AGG):
*        Initial version.
*     2008-07-16 (TIMJ):
*        Clone the NDF identifier so it can be closed separately.
*        Use one_strlcpy.
