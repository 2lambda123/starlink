*  Name:
*     smf_find_meantau

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the mean tau reading from the header

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     tau = smf_calc_meantau( const smfHead * hdr, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     hdr = const smfHead * (Given)
*        Header from which to obtain the FITS information
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This function reads the FITS header to determine the mean tau
*     in CSO units. Preference is given to values derived from the WVM
*     FITS headers. If those are invalid CSO tau headers will be used.
*
*     Looks at the date headers of the tau readings to determine whether
*     the values should be associated with the observation. For CSO tau
*     the threshold is 15 minutes for WVM data the threshold is 5 minutes.

*  Return Value:
*     tau = double
*        Tau in CSO units. Returns bad value on error and 0.0 if
*        no valid value can be obtained. Does not set status to
*        bad if tau can not be determined.

*  Authors:
*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     2008-07-28 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version.
*     2010-02-16 (TIMJ):
*        Search WVM and TAU225 headers.

*  Notes:
*     - May calculate the mean from two values or may read a single
*       mean header value.
*     - could be expanded in the future to handle scaling from CSO
*       to filter tau. See smf_cso2filt_tau
*     - Does not see whether the start reading is within a reasonable
*       time of the observation, only that the end reading is close
*       enough. Assumes that if the end reading is reasonable the
*       start reading will also be reasonable.
