*  Name:
*     smf_get_moltrans

*  Purpose:
*     Get the molecule name and transition for a rest frequency

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     smf_get_moltrans( double restFreq, char **molecule,
*                       char **transition, int * status);

*  Arguments:
*     restFreq = double (Given)
*        Rest frequency in MHz.
*     molecule = char** (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to the name of the molecular species.
*     transition = char** (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to the name of the transition.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This function uses the look up table of frequencies in
*     smf_moltrans.h to determine the most likely target transition
*     for a given rest frequency.  The name of the molecule and
*     transition of the closest frequency is returned.
