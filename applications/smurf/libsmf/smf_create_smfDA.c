*  Name:
*     smf_create_smfDA

*  Purpose:
*     Allocate a smfDA structure

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     pntr = smf_create_smfDA( int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Return Value:
*     smf_create_smfDA = smfDa*
*        Pointer to newly created smfDA. NULL on error.

*  Description:
*     This function allocates memory for a smfDA structure and
*     all the internal structures. The structure is initialised.

*  Notes:
*     - Free this memory using smf_close_file, via a smfData structure.
*     - Memory for the flatfield structures is not allocated by this
*       routine.
*     - Can be freed with a smf_free if sc2store resources are freed first.

*  History:
*     2006-01-26 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version.
*     2006-01-27 (TIMJ):
*        Remove dksquid entry for now
*     2008-07-11 (TIMJ):
*        Add dksquid.
*     2010-03-09 (TIMJ):
*        flatname is now flatmeth. Add heatval/nheat.
