*  Arguments:
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Displays help about SMURF.  The help information has classified
*     and alphabetical lists of commands, general information about
*     SMURF and related material; it describes individual commands in
*     detail.
*
*     Here are some of the main options.
*        smurfhelp
*           No parameter is given so the introduction and the top-level
*           help index is displayed.
*        smurfhelp application/topic
*           This gives help about the specified application or topic.
*        smurfhelp application/topic subtopic
*           This lists help about a subtopic of the specified
*           application or topic. The hierarchy of topics has a maximum
*           of four levels.
*        smurfhelp Hints
*           This gives hints for new and intermediate users.
*        smurfhelp summary
*           This shows a one-line summary of each application.
*        smurfhelp classified classification
*           This lists a one-line summary of each application in the
*           given functionality classification.
*
*     See the Section "Navigating the Help Library" for details how to
*     move around the help information, and to select the topics you
*     want to view.

*  Usage:
*     smurfhelp [topic] [subtopic] [subsubtopic] [subsubsubtopic]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     TOPIC = LITERAL (Read)
*        Topic for which help is to be given. [" "]
*     SUBTOPIC = LITERAL (Read)
*        Subtopic for which help is to be given. [" "]
*     SUBSUBTOPIC = LITERAL (Read)
*        Subsubtopic for which help is to be given. [" "]
*     SUBSUBSUBTOPIC = LITERAL (Read)
*        Subsubsubtopic for which help is to be given. [" "]

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Call smfAdam

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  Uses the portable help system.

*  Navigating The Help Library:
*     The help information is arranged hierarchically.  You can move
*     around the help information whenever SMURFHELP prompts.  This
*     occurs when it has either presented a screen's worth of text or
*     has completed displaying the previously requested help.  The
*     information displayed by SMURFHELP on a particular topic includes a
*     description of the topic and a list of subtopics that further
*     describe the topic.
*
*     At a prompt you may enter:
*        o  a topic and/or subtopic name(s) to display the help for that
*           topic or subtopic, so for example, "block parameters box"
*           gives help on BOX, which is a subtopic of Parameters, which
*           in turn is a subtopic of BLOCK;
*
*        o  a <CR> to see more text at a "Press RETURN to continue ..."
*           request;
*
*        o  a <CR>} at topic and subtopic prompts to move up one level
*           in the hierarchy, and if you are at the top level it will
*           terminate the help session;
*
*        o  a CTRL/D (pressing the CTRL and D keys simultaneously) in
*           response to any prompt will terminate the help session;
*
*        o  a question mark "?" to redisplay the text for the current
*           topic, including the list of topic or subtopic names; or
*
*        o  an ellipsis "..." to display all the text below the
*           current point in the hierarchy.  For example, "BLOCK..."
*           displays information on the BLOCK topic as well as
*           information on all the subtopics under BLOCK.
*
*     You can abbreviate any topic or subtopic using the following
*     rules.
*
*        o  Just give the first few characters, e.g. "PARA" for
*           Parameters.
*
*        o  Some topics are composed of several words separated by
*           underscores.  Each word of the keyword may be abbreviated,
*           e.g. "Colour_Set" can be shortened to "C_S".
*
*        o  The characters "%" and "*" act as wildcards, where the
*           percent sign matches any single character, and asterisk
*           matches any sequence of characters.  Thus to display
*           information on all available topics, type an asterisk in
*           reply to a prompt.
*
*        o  If a word contains, but does end with an asterisk wildcard,
*           it must not be truncated.
*
*        o  The entered string must not contain leading or embedded
*           spaces.
*
*     Ambiguous abbreviations result in all matches being displayed.
