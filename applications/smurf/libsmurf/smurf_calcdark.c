*  Name:
*     CALCDARK

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate the 2d dark frame from dark observation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     smurf_calcdark( int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Given a set of dark observations, calculate a mean dark frame
*     from each. A bad bolometer mask can be supplied to remove known
*     bad bolometers. Does not flatfield.

*  Notes:
*     Dark files will be subtracted from raw data during the
*     flatfielding step. Commands that flatfield data can use either
*     raw dark files or the output from CALCDARK.

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BBM = NDF (Read)
*          Group of files to be used as bad bolometer masks. Each data file
*          specified with the IN parameter will be masked. The corresponding
*          previous mask for a subarray will be used. If there is no previous
*          mask the closest following one will be used. It is not an error for
*          no mask to match. A NULL parameter indicates no mask files to be
*          supplied. [!]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*          Input files to be processed. Non-darks will be filtered out.
*     MSG_FILTER = _CHAR (Read)
*          Control the verbosity of the application. Values can be
*          NONE (no messages), QUIET (minimal messages), NORMAL,
*          VERBOSE, DEBUG or ALL. [NORMAL]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*          Output dark files. These can be used as bad bolometer masks
*          in subsequent processing steps via the BBM parameter in
*          other SCUBA-2 SMURF commands.
