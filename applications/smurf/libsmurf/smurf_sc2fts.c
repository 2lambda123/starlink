*  Name:
*     SC2FTS

*  Purpose:
*     Fourier Transform Spectrometer specialist routines (incomplete).

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     smurf_sc2fts( int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This command can be used to process Fourier Transform Spectrometer
*     data for SCUBA-2. The commands are incomplete, should not be used
*     at this time and may look very different when finally released.

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*          Name of input data file.
*     MSG_FILTER = _CHAR (Read)
*          Control the verbosity of the application. Values can be
*          NONE (no messages), QUIET (minimal messages), NORMAL,
*          VERBOSE, DEBUG or ALL. [NORMAL]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*          Name of processed output file.

*      Do not use this command yet.

*  History:
*     2008-03-16 (BZ):
*        Create a test code skeleton
