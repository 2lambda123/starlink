*  Name:
*     sc2sim_addpnoise

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate photon noise and add to a flux.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     sc2sim_addpnoise( double flux_0, double sig_0, double integ_time,
*                       double *flux, int *status ) {

*  Arguments:
*     flux_0 = double (Given)
*        Reference power per pixel in pW
*     sig_0 = double (Given)
*        NEP at reference power in pW/sqrt(Hz)
*     integ_time = double (Given)
*        Effective integration time in sec
*     flux = double* (Given and Returned)
*        Flux value in pW
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Calculate the photon equivalent of the given flux allowing the
*     corresponding photon noise sigma to be calculated. Use this to
*     scale a generated random number.

*        Original
*     2002-08-19 (BDK):  
*        C version
*     2003-05-22 (BDK):
*        Multiply photon noise by 1.5
*     2004-01-23 (BDK):  
*        Use dsim_getsigma 
*     2006-07-19 (JB):
*        Split from dsim.c
*     2006-09-22 (JB):
*        Removed dream.h requirements
*     2007-06-29 (EC):
*        Removed physical model for noise and replaced with simple scaling
*        from reference power/noise
