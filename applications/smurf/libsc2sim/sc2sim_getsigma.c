*  Name:
*     sc2sim_getsigma.c

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate photon noise (NEP) in pW/sqrt(Hz)

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     sc2sim_getsigma ( double flux_0, double sig_0,
*                       double flux, double *sig, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     flux_0 = double (Given)
*        Reference power per pixel in pW
*     sig_0 = double (Given)
*        NEP at reference power in pW/sqrt(Hz)
*     flux = double (Given)
*        Power per pixel in pW
*     sig = double* (Returned)
*        NEP in pW/sqrt(hz)
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.  

*  Description:
*     Calculate photon noise

*  History :
*     2006-07-20 (JB):
*        Split from dsim.c
*     2007-06-29 (EC):
*        Removed physical model for noise and replaced with simple scaling
*        from reference power/noise
*     2008-04-28 (AGG):
*        Change return type to void
