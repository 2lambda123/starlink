*  Name:
*     sc2sim_getpongends.c

*  Purpose:
*     Get coordinates of straight PONG vertices

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     sc2sim_getpongends ( double width, double height, double spacing, 
*                          double grid[][2], int *numvertices, 
*                          int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     width = double (Given)
*        Minimum width of PONG pattern (arcsec)
*     height = double (Given)
*        Minimum height of PONG pattern (arcsec)
*     spacing = double (Given)
*        Spacing of grid pattern (arcsec)
*     grid = double[][2] (Returned)
*        Array of vertex coordinates
*     numvertices = int* (Returned)
*        Total number of vertices
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.  

*  Description:
*     This routine determines the vertices and their order for 
*     a straight PONG pattern.  The vertices along the x- and 
*     y- directions can share no common factors for the pattern
*     to be complete and close.
