 *  Name:
 *     sc2sim_smupath

 *  Purpose:
 *     Calculate the path positions of the SMU

 *  Language:
 *     Starlink ANSI C

 *  Type of Module:
 *     Subroutine

 *  Invocation:
 *     sc2sim_smupath ( int nvert, double vertex_t, int jig_ver[][2],
 *                      double jig_stepx, double jig_stepy, int movecode,

 *                      int pathsz, double jigpath[][2], int *status )

 *  Arguments:
 *     nvert = int (Given)
 *        Number of vertices in the jiggle pattern,
 *        implemented are :
 *        =1 : No visit of points.
 *        At the moment a circle but that does not work !
 *        =4 : Visit 4 points on a square.
 *        =5 : Visit 5 points on a '+'
 *        =8 : Visit 8 points on a star. (This is the best)
 *     vertex_t = double (Given)
 *        Time for movement between vertices in sec
 *     jig_vert = int[][2] (Given)
 *        Table with relative vertex coordinates in time
 *     jig_stepx = double (Given)
 *        The step size in -X- direction between Jiggle
 *        positions in arcsec
 *     jig_stepy = double (Given)
 *        The step size in -Y- direction between Jiggle
 *        positions in arcsec
 *     movecode = int (Given)
 *        The code for the SMU waveform that determines the
 *        SMU motion
 *     nppp = int (Given)
 *        The number of calculated coordinates in the path
 *        between 2 successive vertices
 *     steptime = double (Given)
 *        Time between samples in sec
 *     smu_offset = double (Given)
 *        smu timing offset in msec
 *     pathsz = int (Given)
 *        maximum no of path points
 *     jigpath = double[][2] (Returned)
 *        Buffer containing the X and Y coordinates of each
 *        point in the path of the SMU during the Jiggle in
 *        units of arcsec
 *     status = int* (Given and Returned)
 *        global status


 *  Description:
 *     This routine calculates all the SMU positions during the cycle
 *     This depends on the Jiggle Pattern, the SMU waveform, and the
 *     overdimensioning factor.

 *        Original
 *     2002-10-31 (bdk):
 *        C translation
 *     2003-02-13 (bdk):
 *        change to use dream_smupos and to allow smu_offset
 *     2003-06-20 (bdk):
 *        pass-in pathsz, change constant name to DREAM__MXVERT
 *     2006-09-15 (JB):
 *        Convert to sc2sim_smupath from dream_smupath
