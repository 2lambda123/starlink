*  Name:
*     sc2sim_getscaling.c

*  Purpose:
*     Get parameters for scaling data to integers

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     sc2sim_getscaling ( int ncoeffs, double coeffs[], double targetpow, 
*                         double photonsigma, double *digmean, 
*                         double *digscale, double *digcurrent, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     ncoeffs = int (Given)
*        Number of coefficients describing response curve
*     coeffs = double[] (Given)
*        Array to hold response curve coefficients
*     targetpow = double (Given)
*        Target power level in pW
*     photonsigma = double (Given)
*        Photon noise level
*     digmean = double* (Returned)
*        Mean digitised level
*     digscale = double* (Returned)
*        Digitisation scale factor (Returned)
*     digcurrent = double* (Returned)
*        Current in amps at digmean
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.  

*  Description:
*     The simulated bolometer current is to be "digitised" using the formula
*
*     digval = int ( 0.5 + ( current - digcurrent ) * digscale + digmean )
*
*     where the three digitisation parameters are chosen so that the
*     current corresponding to the target power level falls in the middle
*     of a 24-bit range, and one digitisation level is one-sixth of the
*     photon noise dispersion (this assumes the digitisation can encode
*     instrumental noise, and the latter is about 1/3 of photon noise).
