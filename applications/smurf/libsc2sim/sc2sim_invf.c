*  Name:
*     sc2sim_invf

*  Purpose:
*     Generate a 1/f plus white noise sequence

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     sc2sim_invf ( double sigma, double corner, double samptime, 
*                   int nsamples, double *fnoise, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     sigma = double (Given)
*        White noise level
*     corner = double (Given)
*        Corner frequency
*     samptime = double (Given)
*        Time in sec between samples
*     nsamples = int (Given)
*        Number of positions in sequence
*     fnoise = double* (Returned)
*        Array to hold noise sequence
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.  

*  Description:
*     Return a sequence of values with combined 1/f and white noise 
*     characteristics.
*     Simulate a 1/f noise sequence by generating white noise sequence, 
*     Fourier transforming it, applying a 1/f law, then transforming back
*     again. Generate and add a new white noise sequence.
