*  Name:
*     sc2sim_digitise

*  Purpose:
*     Convert array of currents to integers

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     sc2sim_digitise ( int nvals, double current[], double digmain, 
*                       double digscale, double digcurrent, 
*                       int digits[], int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     nvals = int (Given)
*        Number of values
*     current = double[] (Given)
*        Signal values in amps
*     digmean = double (Given)
*        Mean digitised level 
*     digscale = double (Given)
*        Digitisation scale factor
*     digcurrent - double (Given)
*        Current in amps at digmean
*     digits = int[] (Returned)
*        Digitised currents
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     The simulated bolometer current is to be "digitised" using the formula
*
*     digval = int ( 0.5 + ( current - digcurrent ) * digscale + digmean )
*
*     where the three digitisation parameters are chosen so that the
*     current corresponding to the target power level falls in the middle
*     of a 24-bit range, and one digitisation level is one-sixth of the
*     photon noise dispersion (this assumes the digitisation can encode
*     instrumental noise, and the latter is about 1/3 of photon noise).
