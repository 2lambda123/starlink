*  Name:
*     sc2sim_getweights.c

*  Purpose:
*     Return weights for smoothing by impulse response

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     sc2sim_getweights ( double decay, double samptime, int nweights, 
                          double weights[], int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     decay = double (Given)
*        Time constant in millisec
*     samptime = double (Given)
*        Sampling time in millisec
*     nweights = int (Given)
*        Number of values to be returned
*     weights = double[] (Returned)
*        Array to hold returned values
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.  

*  Description:
*     A set of values suitable to act as a colvolving kernel to 
*     match the impulse response is generated.
