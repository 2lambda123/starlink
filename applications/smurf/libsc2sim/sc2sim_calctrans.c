*  Name:
*     sc2sim_calctrans

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate sky zenith % atmospheric transmission

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     sc2sim_calctrans ( double lambda, double *trans, double tauCSO, 
*                        int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     lambda = double (Given)
*        Wavelength in metres
*     trans = double* (Returned)
*        % Atmospheric transmission
*     tauCSO = double (Given)
*        CSO optical depth
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Calculate the atmospheric transmission equivalent to the given 
*     optical depth for this wavelength band.  This is essentially the
*     opposite of dsim_calctau.

*        Trap cases when tauCSO is out of range. Shouldn't happen of
*        course...
