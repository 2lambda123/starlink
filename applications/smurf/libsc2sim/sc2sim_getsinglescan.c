 *  Name:
 *     sc2sim_getsinglescan

 *  Purpose:
 *     Get coordinates of straight scan path

 *  Language:
 *     Starlink ANSI C

 *  Type of Module:
 *     Subroutine

 *  Invocation:
 *     sc2sim_getsinglescan ( double angle, double pathlength, double accel[2],
 *                            double vmax[2], double samptime, int *scancount,
 *                            double **posptr, int *status )

 *  Arguments:
 *     angle = double (Given)
 *        Angle of pattern relative to the telescope axes in radians
 *        anticlockwise
 *     pathlength = double (Given)
 *        Length of scan path in arcsec
 *     accel = double[2] (Given)
 *        Telescope accelerations (arcsec)
 *     vmax = double[2] (Given)
 *        Telescope maximum velocities (arcsec)
 *     samptime = double (Given)
 *        Sample interval in sec
 *     scancount = int* (Returned)
 *        Number of positions in pattern
 *     posptr = double** (Returned)
 *        list of positions
 *     status = int* (Given and Returned)
 *        Pointer to global status.

 *  Description:
 *     This routine determines the scanning positions for a scan in
 *     a straight line, given a scan length and angle from the
 *     telescope axes.
 *
 *     Effects of "jerk" - ie time for change in acceleration, or other
 *     telescope inertia effects are ignored.
