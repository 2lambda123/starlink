*  Name:
*     sc2sim_getspread.c

*  Purpose:
*     Return scattered characteristics of bolometers

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     sc2sim_getspread ( int numbols, double pzero[], 
*                        double heater[], int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     numbols = int (Given)
*        Number of bolometers
*     pzero = double[] (Returned)
*        Array to hold response curve offsets of 
*        bolometers in pW
*     heater = double[] (Returned)
*        Array to hold heater factors of bolometers
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.  

*  Description:
*     Use scaled random numbers for the response curve offsets.
*     The heater factors are 1.0 with a 5% random spread, simulating a
*     spread in the heater resistors of each bolometer.
