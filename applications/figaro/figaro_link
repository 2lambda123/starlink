#  Name:
#     figaro_link
#
#  Purpose:
#     Assist linking with Figaro libraries.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.
#
#  Invocation:
#     alink file.o [libxyz.a ...] \
#        [-lnag ...] \
#        -L/star/figaro -L/star/lib `$FIG_DIR/figaro_link` \
#        [-lucb]
#
#  Description:
#     This script assists in linking with Figaro libraries.
#
#     The link command is "alink". This script does not specify any directories
#     where to look for libraries specified with -l options. To locate the
#     Starlink libraries, "-L/star/lib" must be specified by the user. To
#     locate the Figaro libraries, "-L/star/figaro" must be specified by
#     the user.
#
#     If linking with the NAG library or other libraries is required,
#     this must also be specified by the user.
#
#     On Solaris (only) an additional library must be linked with, which is
#     not taken care of by "alink". This is "-lucb".

#  History:
#     10 Jan 1995 (hme):
#        Original Version.
#     11 Jan 1995 (hme):
#        Add agi_link_adam to link options. Needed for FIG_PG* (appstl) only.
#     05 Feb 1995 (hme):
#        Do not include the *_link_adam commands here and don't use an awk to
#        sort the libraries. The total number of libraries stuffed into awk may
#        become too big.
#     18 Oct 1995 (hme):
#        Try again to generate the full list, but only a minimum of Starlink
#        link scripts.
#     11 Dec 1995 (hme):
#        Use the _adam variations of Starlink link scripts.
#     26 Jun 1996 (mjcl):
#        Figaro libraries are mentioned here, not in the makefile.
#        The makefile doesn't know that DSA/DTA contain the same routines
#        as FDA and that one has to make a choice.
#     11 Nov 1998 (acd):
#        Added FLA library.
