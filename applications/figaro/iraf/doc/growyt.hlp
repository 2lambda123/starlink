 GROWYT - Copies an image into contiguous YT planes of a cube


Description

 GROWYT copies an image into successive planes of a cube (strictly
 a cuboid) for which the X value is constant.  This is the reverse
 of the YTPLANE fnction, except that all the planes grown into the
 cube are the same.

Parameters


IMAGE

 The name of the image to be used.

CUBE

 The name of the data cube into which the image
 is to be grown.  Successive 'X' planes (planes for which
 the first array index is constant) will be set the same
 as IMAGE.  If CUBE does not exist, one will be created.
 If it does exist, its second and third dimensions must
 match the dimensions of IMAGE.

XSTART

 The number of the first plane in the cube
 involved in this operation.

XEND

 The number of the last plane in the cube
 involved in this operation.

NEW

 If not set, and a cube of the specified name exists,
 then IMAGE will be grown into that existing cube.
 If NEW is set, a new cube will always be created.

XSIZE

 If a new cube has to be created, its first dimension
 is unknown and has to specified as XSIZE.  The other
 two dimensions will be those of the image.

 This is the main routine for the Figaro commands GROWXY, GROWXT
 and GROWYT.  These both copy an cube into one or more
 planes of a cuboid, GROWXY copying into planes of constant T,
 GROWYT into planes of constant X, and GROWXT into planes of
 constant Y.  The operations performed by GROWXY, GROWXT and
 GROWYT are the inverses of XYPLANE, XTPLANE and YTPLANE
 respectively.

 Command parameters -

 IMAGE       (Character) The name of the input image file.
             This will actually be image.dst.

 CUBE        (Character) The name of the cube into which the
             image is to be copied.  If the cube file does
             not exist, or if NEW is set, a new file is created
             with all other data elements set to zero.

 XSTART,     (Numeric) The number of the first plane
 YSTART or   into which the image is to be copied.  XSTART
 TSTART      is used by GROWYT, YSTART by GROWXT, TSTART by GROWXY.

 XEND,       (Numeric) The number of the last plane
 YEND, or    into which the image is to be copied.  XEND is
 TEND        used by GROWYT, YEND by GROWXT, TEND by GROWXY.

 XSIZE,      (Numeric) If a new cube has to be created, two
 YSIZE, or   of its dimensions will be those of the image, but
 TSIZE       the other is unknown.  This has to be specified as
             XSIZE, YSIZE or TSIZE for GROWYT, GROWXT, GROWXY
             respectively.

 Command Keywords

 NEW         Used to force the creation of a new cube, even if
             such an cube exists already.
