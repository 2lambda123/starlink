 Version 5.6-0 of Figaro has recently been released.  Figaro is a
 powerful and comprehensive general-purpose package for the reduction
 of astronomical images and spectra.  It contains particularly extensive
 facilities for spectroscopy.

 Version 5.6-0 contains relatively few changes: the automatic propagation
 of errors has been added to a few more applications, there have been a
 number of bug fixes and minor enhancements and there is one new minor
 application.  In addition the user manual has been slightly revised.
 Brief details of the changes are given below.

Error Propagation


 Error Propagation has been added to the following applications: BBODY,
 FWCONV, IRFLAT, ISHIFT, IXSMOOTH and SFIT.


Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements


 Either bugs have been fixed in, or minor enhancements have been made to,
 the following applications: CSPIKE, ECHSELECT, EMLT, FITGAUSS, SCROSS
 and SPFLUX.  In addition, corrections have been made to the documentation
 for CENTERS and SPECCONT.


New Application


 The new application IMPOS has been added.  It simply reads a text file
 containing a list of X,Y positions and writes them to the environment
 variables which input values to application CENTERS.  Thus, it provides
 a mechanism for using CENTERS from a script rather than interactively.
