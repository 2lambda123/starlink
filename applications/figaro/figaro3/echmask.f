      SUBROUTINE ECHMASK
*+
*                               E C H M A S K
*
*  Program name:
*     ECHMASK
*
*  Function:
*     Write a mask image that can be used for quick-look extraction of
*     orders from a raw echelle image.
*
*  Description:
*     The program reads a file that identifies where the orders are in
*     the image and sets the values in the mask to be zero if that pixel
*     in the mask does not lie in an order and to a number derived from
*     the order number otherwise (see below). It is guaranteed that
*     every order is extracted using the same number of rows, but of
*     course the position of these rows may vary along an order so one
*     can expect visible jumps in the extracted data, especially if too
*     fews rows are extracted to take all the data from the object.
*
*     The coefficient file will normally have been written by SDIST and
*     if so must have been written by the version of SDIST that was
*     modified to support ECHMASK.
*     
*     The PERISCOPE keyword (see below) determines whether each order
*     has two separate parts (corresponding to object and sky and due to
*     the special periscope that samples object and sky at a wide
*     spacing and brings them together on the slit) or one part
*     (corresponding simply to the slit).  The data values in the mask
*     are 10 * (true order number) + (sub-order number) where the
*     sub-order number is 0 if there is no periscope fitted, 1 if this
*     is the first part of an order and 2 if this is the second part of
*     the order. The "first" and "second" parts of an order are defined
*     so that the actual data values in the mask are monotonic along a
*     vertical slice through it, ie they might go 412, 411, 402, 401 if
*     the periscope is fitted and they might go 410, 400 if it is not
*     fitted.
*
*     If PERISCOPE is false then the user has the option of splitting
*     the data in an order into object and up to two separate regions of
*     sky. The object is assigned sub-order 1 and the sky is assigned
*     sub-order 2. Note that this assignment may differ from when
*     PERISCOPE is true, since in that case there is no guarantee that
*     sub-order 1 is object - it may be sky!  There may be room for
*     enhancement here.
*
*  Parameters:
*
*     (>) COFILE        (Character) The name of the coefficient file.
*                       Default SDIST.
*     (>) PERISCOPE     (Keyword) Whether or not the periscope is
*                       fitted. Default TRUE.
*     (>) OBJWIDTH      (Integer) The number of rows to be extracted on
*                       behalf of the object per order.  If PERISCOPE is
*                       TRUE then object and sky are not distinguished
*                       between and this width also applies to the sky.
*                       If PERISCOPE is FALSE then this width applies
*                       only to the object and the position of the sky
*                       is specified using the S1* and S2* parameters.
*                       If OBJWIDTH is specified as zero then the width
*                       information from the coefficient file is used to
*                       derive a sensible value. Default 0.
*     (>) OBJOFFSET     (Float) The offset of the centre of the object
*                       data from the centre of each order. If specified
*                       as being non-zero and if OBJWIDTH is zero, the
*                       derived width is adjusted to take account of the
*                       offset. Default 0.
*     (>) S1WIDTH       (Integer) The number of rows to be extracted on
*                       behalf of the first region of sky per order.
*                       This and the other S* parameters are prompted
*                       for only if PERISCOPE is false. If specified as
*                       zero, it is assumed that no sky is to be
*                       extracted and the remaining S* parameters are
*                       not prompted for. Default 0.
*     (>) S1OFFSET      (Float) The offset of the centre of the first
*                       region of sky from the centre of the object data
*                       (not necessarily from the centre of the order).
*                       Default 0.
*     (>) S2WIDTH       (Integer) These parameters are the same as
*     (>) S2OFFSET      (Float)   S1WIDTH and S2OFFSET but they refer to
*                                 the second region of sky if any.
*                                 Defaults 0.
*     (>) MSTART        (Integer) The order number of the first
*                       "spectrum" in the coefficient file. Default 1.
*     (>) MDELTA        (Integer) +1 if order numbers increase as
*                       "spectrum number" increased, -1 otherwise.
*                       Default -1.
*     (<) MASK          (File) The name of the output mask image. This
*                       is created with only a .Z.DATA structure.
*                       Default MASK.

*     Fill in the mask values. Simply cycle through each track being very
*     careful to extract exactly the requested number of rows of object
*     and sky.
*
      DO TRACK=1,NTRACKS
*
*        Calculate (ten times) the order number. If the periscope is fitted
*        then there are two tracks per order. One is object and the other is
*        sky but we don't know which is which!

*
*           Fill in mask values. The range of rows is a function of whether
*           the required width is even or odd. If it is odd the centre is
*           rounded to the nearest pixel and equal numbers of rows are used
*           each side of it. If it is even the centre is rounded down to
*           the nearest half pixel and equal numbers of rows are used each
*           side of the half pixel boundary. First do the object data. The
*           data value to write depends on the value of PERISCOPE. If it
*           is TRUE, it is 10 * (order number) + (one or two). If it is
*           FALSE it is 10 * (order number) + (one).
