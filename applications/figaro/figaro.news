 Version 5.6-5

 A bug in the movie application has been fixed. Previously the movie
 axis had to be shorter than the first axis.

 Version 5.6-3 of Figaro has recently been released.  Figaro is a
 powerful and comprehensive general-purpose package for the reduction
 of astronomical images and spectra.  It contains particularly extensive
 facilities for spectroscopy.

 The changes in Version 5.6-3 comprise only a few minor bug fixes
 and enhancements, and a missing flux calibration file has been added.
 Brief details of the changes are given below.

 Figaro is documented in SUN/86.  To view a hypertext version of this

2 Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

 GAUSS and IARC have each received both a bug fix and a minor
 enhancement.  Consequently, there has been an equally minor revision to
 the description of GAUSS in the user manual.

 EMLT has a new NOISE keyword.  If it is specified, allowance for
 noise is made when determining the line limits.  This is intended for
 broad emission features or beam location rather than narrow arc lines.
 It defaults to the former behaviour.

 SDIST allows for broader spectral profiles when tracing a  spectrum.  There
 was an arbitrary cut-off of the size of the extracted cross-section to be
 fitted.

2 Flux Calibration Files

 The flux calibration file for Hiltner 102, hil102.tab, was missing.  It
 has been added.
