C
C  Routine name:
C     FIG_DFITS_OPEN
C
C  Function:
C     Opens a 'disk FITS' file for input.
C
C  Description:
C     This routine is designed to work with FIG_DFITS_READ and FIG_DFITS_HREAD
C     to provide a simple set of routines that can access 'disk FITS' files.
C     The way unformatted files are read varies between different systems,
C     and these routines exist in order to hide these differences from the
C     main application code.  FIG_DFITS_OPEN will open a 'disk FITS' file,
C     and FIG_DFITS_READ will read a 2880 byte data record from that file
C     and FIG_DFITS_HREAD will read a 2880 byte header record from it.
C     Finally, FIG_DFITS_CLOSE will close the file.
C
C  Language:
C     FORTRAN
C
C  Call:
C     CALL FIG_DFITS_OPEN (LUN,FILENAME,STATUS)
C
C  Parameters:   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C
C     (>) LUN           (Integer, ref) The logical unit number to use
C                       to access the file.
C     (>) FILENAME      (Fixed string,descr) The name of the file in
C                       question.  This will normally be as provided by
C                       the parameter system.  The string will be 'case-
C                       sensitive but not case-prescriptive' - the routine
C                       will first try the string exactly as provided, and
C                       if it does not find such a file will fold it to
C                       the preferred case for the system in question.
C     (<) STATUS        (Integer,ref) Status for the operation.  0=>OK,
C                       non-zero => unable to open file.  If an error has
C                       occurred, suitable error messages will be output
C                       by this routine through PAR_WRUSER calls.

C  Note:
C     This version is for a UNIX system (despite some of the VMS like
C     subroutines it uses - it is assumed that there are UNIX versions
C     of these available), and has been tested on a SUN and a DecStation.
C
C  Subroutine / function details:
C     ICH_LEN      Position of last non-blank character in string.
C     GEN_FORTERR  Returns text describing a FORTRAN error code.
