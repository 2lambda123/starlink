C     Finds the FIRST element in the output wavelength array that 
C     overlaps an element in the input array, and returns the overlap 
C     range and the total flux in the overlap region.
C     
C     Parameters -   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C 
C     (>) NIN       (Integer) The number of elements in the input arrays
C     (>) DATIN     (Real array, DATIN(NIN)) The data to be redistributed.
C     (>) XIN       (Double precision array XIN(NIN)) The wavelength
C                   values for the centers of the ranges covered by each
C                   of the input data elements.  This routine assumes
C                   that the values in XIN are in ascending order.
C     (>) NELM      (Integer) The number of the element in the input
C                   array that we are looking for overlaps with.
C     (>) FLUXDEN   (Logical) False if the data is to be treated as
C                   being in flux units, true if it to be treated as
C                   being in flux units per unit wavelength.
C     (>) INTERP    (Integer) Controls any interpolation that may be
C                   performed between data values.  0 => no interpolation
C                   (that is, data in bins is treated as being flat),
C                   1 => linear interpolation, 2 => quadratic interpolation.
C     (>) WID       (Real) The width in wavelength of the input element.
C     (>) XOUT      (Double precision array XOUT(NOUT)) The wavelength
C                   values of the centres of the output elements.
C                   This routine assumes that the values in XOUT are
C                   in ascending order.
C     (>) NOUT      (Integer) The number of elements in the output arrays.
C     (>) LOGOUT    (Logical) If true, indicates that the values of the
C                   output wavelength array increase logarithmicaly.
C     (!) OUTELM    (Integer) Number of an element in the output array.
C                   (>) A sensible element number at which to start looking
C                       for an overlap.
C                   (<) The number of the first element in the output array
C                       which overlaps element NELM in the input array.
C                       Only meaningful if OVERLAP > 0.
C     (<) FLUX      (Real) The total flux in that part of the input bin
C                   that overlaps the output bin.
C     (<) OVERLAP   (Real) The overlap in wavelength between the two bins.
C                   If there is no overlapping element, OVERLAP is set
C                   to zero.
