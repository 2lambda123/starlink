      SUBROUTINE FIG_XYFIT(X,Y,NN,COEFFS,M)
C
C     F I G _ X Y F I T
C
C     Performs a least squares fit of order M to the NN data
C     points in X and Y, returning a power series polynomial.
C
C     Parameters -  (">" input, "<" output)
C
C     (>) X      (Real array X(NN)) The X values of the points to 
C                be fitted.
C     (>) Y      (Real array Y(NN)) The Y values of the points to
C                be fitted.
C     (>) NN     (Integer) The number of points.  This routine is
C                limited by its internal storage to 100 points.
C     (<) COEFFS (Double precision COEFFS(M+1)) The coefficients of the
C                power series polynomial fitted to the points.  The
C                constant term is returned in COEFFS(M+1).
C     (>) M      (Integer) The order of the polynomial to be fitted.

C     Common variables used -  None

C     History - This routine has a dubious pedigree, originating in a 
C     routine used in the IPCS Interdata software and lifted from one
C     of the appendices in the IBM Fortran IV manual!  It was then used
C     in Spica, with modifications made by all sorts of people.  At
C     Caltech it was re-written for Figaro to use the IMSL math library,
C     and now this current version, from AAO, uses a combination of NAG
C     routines and a coefficient decoder wirtten by John Lucey (GEN_
C     CHB2NO).  In all this, the calling sequence has remained unchanged.
C     The original IBM example needed no extra workspace, so none is
C     passed to the routine.  All further modifications have required
C     temporary workspace; hence the limitation on the number of points
C     that can be handled.  The use of PAR_WRUSER for output messages
C     makes this routine somewhat FIGARO-specific.

C                    COEFFS had constant as first term, not last.
