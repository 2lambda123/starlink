      SUBROUTINE SPD_CZJD( INFO, MODE, NPIX, OPIX, NCOMP, ROWNUM, FWHM,
     :   THRESH, XVAL, DATA, MXDWC, NFEAT, RESULT, RESVAR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_CZJD

*  Purpose:
*     Auto-locate isolated line features in an array row.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_CZJD( INFO, MODE, NPIX, OPIX, NCOMP, ROWNUM, FWHM,
*        THRESH, XVAL, DATA, MXDWC, NFEAT, RESULT, RESVAR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine uses a filtering algorithm to find narrow isolated
*     features in a one-dimensional data set. The features must be
*     postive, that is above the background, like emission lines in a
*     spectrum. The 1-D data set is in general the N-th row of a 2-D
*     data set.
*
*     Given the approximate width of line features (FWHM expressed in
*     pixel coordinates) this routine looks for pixels whose value
*     exceeds that of the average of 5 baseline pixels on either side by
*     at least a given threshold. When such a pixel is found an attempt
*     is made to fit a Gauss or triangle function to the suspected
*     feature. For this purpose a local constant baseline level is
*     subtracted. If the fit converges and the fitted peak exceeds the
*     threshold then the feature's centre and peak are stored in the
*     array provided. Their variances are stored in a separate array.

*  Arguments:
*     INFO = LOGICAL (Given)
*        True if informational messages are to be issued.
*     MODE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The kind of line to be fitted to a feature candidate. 'G' for
*        Gauss, 'T' for triangle. This string must be exact (one upper
*        case letter).
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of the 1-D data set, length of a row in DATA.
*     OPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        This integer should be 1.5 times FWHM. It is used for pixel
*        offsets and for declaring the array size of MXDWC.
*     NCOMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of features that can be stored. This is used
*        for declaring the array size of RESULT and RESVAR.
*     ROWNUM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The row number in DATA to be searched for narrow features.
*     FWHM = REAL (Given)
*        The approximate full width at half maximum of the features to
*        be looked for. This is used for incrementing the pixel count
*        during search, and as a parameter guess for the line fit. The
*        width is a free parameter in the fit, so FWHM need not be
*        precise.
*     THRESH = REAL (Given)
*        The threshold value. A candidate feature must seem to exceed
*        the local background by at least this value. An accepted
*        feature must have a fitted peak exceeding this value.
*     XVAL( NPIX ) = REAL (Given)
*        The pixel coordinates for the row in question. These should run
*        from 0.5 to NPIX-0.5 in steps of 1.0.
*     DATA( NPIX, ROWNUM ) = REAL (Given)
*        The data array. Narrow features are looked for in the ROWNUM-th
*        row.
*     MXDWC( 4 * ( 2 * OPIX + 9 ) ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        This is a workspace needed to pack the local profile before
*        fitting.
*     NFEAT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of features located.
*     RESULT( 2 * NCOMP, ROWNUM ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The array to store the centres and peaks of located features
*        in. Each feature takes up two consecutive elements for the
*        centre and the peak resp. Only the first NFEAT elements in the
*        ROWNUM-th row are set.
*     RESVAR( 2 * NCOMP, ROWNUM ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The array to store the variances of centres and peaks of
*        located features in. Each feature takes up two consecutive
*        elements for the centre and the peak resp. Only the first NFEAT
*        elements in the ROWNUM-th row are set.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status. This may be set if more features are found
*        than can be stored.

*        Original version.
*     16 Mar 1994 (hme):
*        Add logging plot for the row. This is inefficient since the

*     25 Nov 1994 (hme):
*        Renamed from SPADU.
*     30 Jan 1995 (hme):
*        SPD_WAAAx needs integer switches, not logical.
