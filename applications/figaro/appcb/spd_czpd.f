      SUBROUTINE SPD_CZPD( INFO, VARUSE, GID, NMAX, N,
     :   NDF, AXIS, EOF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_CZPD

*  Purpose:
*     Access next valid NDF for RESAMP.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_CZPD( INFO, VARUSE, GID, NMAX, N, NDF, AXIS, EOF, 
*        STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine uses a group of NDFs and accesses the next valid NDF.
*     It is required that the NDF be one-dimensional. Optionally it may
*     be required that the NDF also have a variance component.
*
*     On failure to find a required variance component or if the NDF
*     accessed is not one-dimensional, this routine issues a warning
*     message and tries the next NDF. When the group of NDFs is
*     exhausted, EOF is set true and control returned to the calling
*     routine. All these are no error conditions and STATUS is not
*     modified. Mostly a non-OK STATUS returned from lower levels is
*     annulled by this routine.
*
*     Apart from the main purpose of accessing the next NDF from the
*     group, this routine will establish and annul the group when N = 1
*     and N = -1 respectively.
*
*     This routine returns an NDF identifier. After use
*     the calling routine must annul the NDF identifier.

*  Arguments:
*     INFO = LOGICAL (Given)
*        False if warning messages to be suppressed.
*     VARUSE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        True if existence of variance component in the NDF is required.
*     GID = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The identifier of the NDF group.
*     NMAX = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The size of the NDF group, i.e. how many NDFs are in the group.
*        NMAX is used only if the IRG routines are used.
*     N = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The index within the group, i.e. which NDF from the group is to
*        be accessed. If the given index does not yield a valid NDF,
*        then this routine will increment the index until a valid NDF is
*        found or the group is exhausted. Thus, on entry N is the next
*        NDF to be tried, on exit N is the valid NDF the identifier of
*        which is returned.
*     NDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The identifier of the successfully accessed NDF. The value is
*        unpredictable if no NDF was accessed, i.e. if EOF is true.
*     AXIS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the non-degenerate axis in the NDF. The NDF is
*        required to be one-dimensional. But if it is a section from a
*        higher-dimensional NDF then all axes are retained, except
*        that the dimensions will be 1. It is vital to know which out of
*        several axes is the one with more than one pixel.
*     EOF = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        True if the list of NDF specifications has been exhausted.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*        Original version.
*     28 Apr 1992 (hme):
*        Switch to David Berry's IRG to handle a group of NDFs.
*     26 Jan 1995 (hme):
*        Renamed from SPAAA.
*     16 Nov 1995 (hme):
*        Try to use GRP/NDF instead of IRG/IRH.
*     15 Oct 1997 (acc):
*        Change name RESAMPLE to RESAMP due to clash of names with FIGARO.
