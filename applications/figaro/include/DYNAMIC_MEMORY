*  Name:
*     DYNAMIC_MEMORY

*  Purpose:
*     Common block for memory addressing.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     INCLUDE 'DYNAMIC_MEMORY'

*  Description:
*     Include file required for Figaro dynamic memory handling.  This
*     defines the dummy common base array DYNAMIC_MEM.

*  Arguments:
*     DYNAMIC_MEM( 1 ) = BYTE (/DYN_DYNAMIC_MEM/)
*        This minimum array can be shared by any modules and hence
*        provides a focus point for memory addressing from where
*        offsets can be calculated.
