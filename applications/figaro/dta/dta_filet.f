      SUBROUTINE DTA_FILET (ENAME,NAME,FILE,STATUS)
C
C     D T A _ F I L E T
C
C     This routine adds the additional information about a top
C     level structure name needed by, for example, DTA_NMFIL
C     into the name cache common variables.
C
C     Parameters -   (">" input, "<" output)
C
C     (>) ENAME    (Character) The top level structure name as entered
C                  into the name cache.  Ie, as passed to DTA_CACHEN.
C     (>) NAME     (Character) The top level structure name as passed
C                  originally to DTA_ASFNAM.  This is not necessarily
C                  the same as ENAME because ENAME may have been
C                  modified to conform to HDS naming requirements.
C     (>) FILE     (Character) The file name associated with the top 
C                  level name, as passed to DTA_ASFNAM.
C     (<) STATUS   (Integer) Receives a status code.
C                  0 => OK
C                  DTA_NOTFND => ENAME is not in the name cache.

C
C     8th  Jan 1992.  KS / AAO.  Syntax of include statements changed to 
C                     remove VMS logical names and to use lower case, to 
C                     enable compilation on a SUN.
C     12th Apr 1993.  HME / UoE, Starlink. For DTACACHE must include SAE_PAR
C                     and DAT_PAR as well.
