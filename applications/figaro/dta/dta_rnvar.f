      SUBROUTINE DTA_RNVAR (OLD,NEW,STATUS)
C
C     D T A _ R N V A R
C
C     Renames a data structure object.  This routine can
C     also be used to modify the dimensions of an object.
C
C     Parameters -   (">" input, "<" output)
C
C     (>) OLD      (Character) Current name of the object to
C                  be renamed.  Any dimensional information
C                  in OLD is ignored.  A top-level name cannot
C                  be changed by this routine.
C     (>) NEW      (Character) The new name for the object. The first
C                  level of NEW should be the same as for OLD (ie they
C                  should be in the same file).  The name can
C                  contain dimensional information if this is to be 
C                  changed.  If arrays are made smaller, some of the
C                  contents will be lost, of course - this applies
C                  to structure arrays too.
C     (<) STATUS   (Integer) Returns a status code.
C                  0 => OK
C                  DTA_NOTFND => Object does not exist
C                  DTA_DIFENV => OLD and NEW differ in their
C                                environments (ie are in different
C                                files).
C                  DTA_RENTOP => Attempt to rename a top level object.
C                  DTA_NOENV  => No environment for new object.
C                  DTA_EXIST  => New object already exists.

C                                    KS / CIT 24th Nov 1982
C     Modified:
C
C     2nd  Apr 1986  KS / AAO. Re-written for the new HDS based
C                    version of the DTA routines.  The limitations
C                    on the allowed dimensional changes have been
C                    removed (note that most changes in dimension
C                    have to be achieved through the creation of a
C                    new data object).  OLD and NEW may now differ 
C                    in their immediate environments, so long as
C                    they are still part of the same file.
C     12th Mar 1987  KS / AAO. Modified to make use of the new routine
C                    DAT_MOULD, available with the 'C' version of HDS.
C                    This increases the range of size/shape changes
C                    that may be done with copying.  This routine can
C                    no longer be used with the original Bliss version
C                    of HDS. (Or any version prior to 3.4)
C     10th Jun 1988  KS / AAO.  No longer refuses to operate on arrays
C                    of structures.
C     20th Jun 1988  KS / AAO.  Check for non-empty structure elements 
C                    and delete them prior to reduction in size of a
C                    structure array.
C     10th Jan 1992  KS / AAO.  Syntax of include statements changed to 
C                    remove VMS logical names and to use lower case, to 
C                    enable compilation on a SUN. Unused variable ADIM
C                    removed.
C     20th Jan 1992  KS / AAO. DAT_MOVE annuls the locator of the moved
C                    object. With the new EMS-using version of HDS, 
C                    any subsequent call to DAT_ANNUL for the same locator
C                    will fail, and now, even if the HDS status is ignored,
C                    the fact that an EMS error has been signalled stores up
C                    trouble for later.  Such calls to DAT_ANNUL are now 
C                    avoided.
C     24th Jan 1992  KS / AAO. Calls to EMS added to control error reporting.
C     14th Oct 1992  HME / UoE, Starlink.  Locating one level up is
C                    not as easy as calling DTA_LOCATE with OLEVELS-1.
C                    One must make sure that OLASTC(OLEVELS-1) points
C                    in front of any array index.
C     12th Mar 1993  HME / UoE. Changed CHARACTER*15 to *(DAT__SZLOC).
C     2005 May 31    MJC/Starlink Use CNF_PVAL for pointers to mapped 
C                    data.

C
C     Can we do this as a simple call to DAT_MOVE, or is a change in
C     dimensions involved?  A change in dimensions that does not involve
C     an increase in the number of dimensions, may be done using a 
C     combination of DAT_MOVE, DAT_ALTER, and DAT_MOULD.  An increase
C     in the number of dimensions requires that we make a copy of the object.  
C
C     We start by assuming that a 'move 'will be OK, and it will not
C     need to be followed by an 'alter'.
C
      MOVE=.TRUE.
      ALTER=.FALSE.
C
C     See if dimensional information was included in the new name.
C
      IF (NDIM.GT.0) THEN

            GO TO 600
         END IF
C
C        Character arrays introduce an additional complication, because 
C        they are held as arrays of strings rather than as arrays of
C        single characters.   See if this is a character array.
C
         CALL DTA_DTATYP(HDSTYPE,TYPE,NCHAR,STATUS)
         IF (STATUS.NE.0) GO TO 600
         IF (TYPE.EQ.'CHAR') THEN
C
C           The main differences between the way we deal with character
C           and other arrays is that any change to the first dimension
C           of a character array (which is the string length and comes
C           from the HDS type) has to be done by copying.  Apart from
C           that, each array dimension in HDS terms is the one higher
C           dimension in DTA terms.  We change the DIMS array and
C           modify the HDS type in case we have to create a new object.
C
            IF (DIMS(1).NE.NCHAR) MOVE=.FALSE.
            CALL DTA_HDSTYP(TYPE,DIMS(1),HDSTYPE,STATUS)
            IF (STATUS.NE.0) GO TO 600
            DO I=2,NDIM
               DIMS(I-1)=DIMS(I)
            END DO
            NDIM=NDIM-1
         END IF
C
C        Now we can check the specified dimensions against those that
C        the object has now.  We are looking to see if the change may be
C        made using DAT_MOVE, DAT_ALTER and DAT_MOULD and we will set
C        MOVE false if this is not the case.  If it can be done in this
C        way, we set ALTER true if there does in fact have to be a change
C        in size and/or shape.
C
         IF (NDIM.GT.ACTDIM) THEN
            MOVE=.FALSE.
         ELSE
C
C           The change does not involve an increase in dimensions, so may
C           be done in situ.  We want to find out if the new size (NELM) 
C           is different to the actual size at present (ACTELM), because
C           things are simpler later if this is the case.
C
            NELM=1
            DO I=1,NDIM
               NELM=NELM*DIMS(I)

            END DO
            IF (NDIM.NE.ACTDIM) THEN
               ALTER=.TRUE.
            ELSE

                  IF (DIMS(I).NE.ADIMS(I)) ALTER=.TRUE.
               END DO
            END IF
         END IF
      END IF
C
      IF (MOVE) THEN
C
C        We can do it by a 'move'.  Any re-dimensioning may be done
C        in situ using DAT_MOULD and DAT_ALTER, Note that since the 
C        'move' will annul the original locator we have to
C        use a clone of it.  This is so DTA_CACHEO can annul the
C        original locator as part of the cleaning up process.
C
         CALL DAT_CLONE(OBJLOC,TLOC,STATUS)
         IF (ALTER) THEN
            IF (NELM.EQ.ACTELM) THEN
C
C              A change in shape without a change in size may be done
C              using a simple call to DAT_MOULD.
C 
               CALL DAT_MOULD(TLOC,NDIM,DIMS,STATUS)
            ELSE
C
C              If the size has to be changed, a trick is involved.  
C              DAT_ALTER may change the size of an object, but it
C              can only change the last dimension.  DAT_MOULD may
C              change the dimensions of an object, but not its total
C              size.  So we mould the object into its desired number
C              of dimensions but with its current size, making its
C              dimensions [1,1,..,ACTELM], alter this so that it has
C              the desired number of dimensions and the desired size
C              by making it [1,1,...,NELM], and then mould it into 
C              the desired shape.
C

               TMPDIM(NDIM)=ACTELM
               CALL DAT_MOULD(TLOC,NDIM,TMPDIM,STATUS)
C
C              Now, if we are dealing with a structure array, and are
C              reducing its size, DAT_ALTER will refuse if any elements
C              that would be deleted are not empty.  So we have to check
C              for that and delete them first.
C
               IF (.NOT.PRIM) THEN
