      SUBROUTINE DTA_MUVAR (NAME,NITEM,ITYPE,POINTER,STATUS)
C
C     D T A _ M U V A R
C
C     Generic routine for obtaining mapped access to an object
C     in the data structure.  This routine returns a pointer
C     to a range of virtual addresses which are mapped onto
C     all or part of the specified data object.  The pointer
C     may be to a range of addresses which have been mapped
C     directly onto the data structure disk file itself, or
C     if conversion or alignment changes were needed, will be to
C     a range of addresses containing the converted or
C     aligned data. 
C
C     Parameters -   (">" input, "<" output )
C
C     (>) NAME     (Character) The object name, in the standard
C                  data structure format.  Should end with a
C                  blank or the string end, and is case 
C                  insignificant.
C     (>) NITEM    (Integer) The number of elements to be
C                  read from the data structure.
C     (>) ITYPE    (Integer) The type code for the data to
C                  be read. Should be one of the TYP_DS..
C                  codes (not a conversion code).
C     (<) POINTER  (Integer) Pointer to the mapped data.
C     (<) STATUS   (Integer) Returns a status code.
C                  0 => OK
C                  Lower level routines may return other error codes

C     DTA_MVAR     (DTA_ package) General mapping routine
C
C                                         KS / CIT 16th March 1983
C     Modified:
C
C     23rd Sept 1985  KS / AAO. Uses DTA_FMTCON instead of STL_FMTCON
C     28th March 1986 KS / AAO. Rewritten for the HDS version of the
C                     DAT package.  All the work is now done by DTA_MVAR.
C     9th  May 1986   KS / AAO. Call to DTA_MVAR now specifies 'UPDATE'
C                     rather than 'WRITE'.  Note that this assumes that
C                     the version of HDS in use no longer has the bug
C                     involving update mapping.
