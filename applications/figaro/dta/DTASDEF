C     Record structure definition parameters.  Note that this file is mostly
C     a relic of the original 'raw DTA' implementation, where the file
C     format was more or less defined in terms of the parameters in this
C     file.  Now the file format depends on the lower HDS level.

C     Modified:
C  
C     8th Jan 1992.  DST_STRUCT removed - it was completely unused and
C                    the SUN compiler gave a warning for it.  KS/AAO.
C     23rd Jan 1992. In fact, the only parameters used by the new system are
C                    DST_MAXLEV and DST_MAXDIM.  All others now removed. KS/AAO.
C+
      INTEGER DST_MAXLEV    ! Maximum number of name levels
      INTEGER DST_MAXDIM    ! Maximum number of dimensions for objects
C 
      PARAMETER (DST_MAXLEV=10,DST_MAXDIM=10)
