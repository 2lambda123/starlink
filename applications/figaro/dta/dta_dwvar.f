      SUBROUTINE DTA_DWVAR (NAME,FILE,BLOCK,STATUS)
C
C     D T A _ D W V A R
C
C     Returns the disk location of a named data object.  This allows
C     direct access to the object using either direct disk I/O calls,
C     or direct mapping of the file.  Note that if either of these
C     is attempted, other access to the same data through DTA should
C     not be attempted at the same time.  If the object is sufficiently
C     small that other objects are held in the same disk blocks as it,
C     this sort of access is very unsafe, and an error code is returned.
C     All non-standard I/O to the object should be closed down before
C     accessing it with reading routines such as DTA_RDVARx.
C
C     Parameters -    (">" input, "<" output)
C
C     (>) NAME     (Character) The name of the data object.
C                  This should be in the standard form for
C                  object names, ie with dots separating the
C                  component names and followed by dimension
C                  information (which is ignored by this routine)
C                  in square brackets.  Should end with a blank
C                  or with the end of the string, and case is
C                  unimportant.
C     (<) FILE     (Character) Returns with the full file name of
C                  the file containing the data object.  Note that
C                  this full file name can be quite long.
C     (<) BLOCK    (Integer) Returns the block number in the file
C                  at which the data starts.  The first block is
C                  number one, not zero.
C     (<) STATUS   (Integer) Returns a status code
C                  0 => OK
C                  DTA_NOTFND => Object does not exist
C                  DTA_INVNAM => Object name is invalid
C                  DTA_INVDIM => Object name has invalid
C                                dimension specifications.
C                  DTA_UNSAFE => Object is not isolated from
C                                other data objects.
C                  Lower level routines may pass back other
C                  error codes.

C                                     KS / AAO 8th Nov 1988
C     Modified:
C 
C     2nd Oct 1989.  Temporary (?) fix.  Now checks that the object's
C                    value is defined, and if not, writes to it to
C                    make sure that it is.  KS/AAO.
C     8th Jan 1992.  KS/AAO.  Syntax of include statements changed to remove
C                    VMS logical names and to use lower case, to enable
C                    compilation on a SUN.  Unused variable NCHAR removed.
C     24th Jan 1992. KS / AAO. Calls to EMS added to control error reporting.
C                    EMS status explicitly annulled before call to HDS,
C                    instead of just setting STATUS to zero.
C     12th Mar 1993. HME / UoE. Changed CHARACTER*15 to *(DAT__SZLOC).

C     Try to make sure object is defined.  Actually doing a write is
C     rather nasty - once HDS gains a call that will allow an object to
C     have its defined flag set, that should be used instead.  (Whether
C     just doing a DTA_DWVAR should define the object is moot, but 
C     doing so is pragmatic.)
