      SUBROUTINE DTA_NMFIL (POS,NAME,FILE,STATUS)
C
C     D T A _ N M F I L
C
C     This routine returns the name of the nth top level structure
C     open at present.  It is intended mainly for use in general
C     purpose clean-up routines that can then close structures they
C     didn't expect to find open.  Note that calls to DTA_ASFNAM or
C     DTA_FCLOSE may change the internal numbering of top level
C     structures.
C
C     Parameters -   (">" input, "<" output)
C
C     (>) POS      (Integer) The number of the top-level structure
C                  whose name is to be obtained. Numbers start at 1.
C     (<) NAME     (Character) Returns with the top-level structure
C                  name, truncated or blank filled, as necessary,
C                  in upper case.  This is the name as passed to
C                  DTA_ASFNAM.
C     (<) FILE     (Character) Returns with the file name associated
C                  with the top level name.
C     (<) STATUS   (Integer) Receives a status code.
C                  0 => OK
C                  DTA_NOTFND => There is no POSth top level structure
C                  open at present.

C
C     10th Jan  1992.  KS / AAO.  Syntax of include statements changed to 
C                      remove VMS logical names and to use lower case, to 
C                      enable compilation on a SUN.
C     12th Apr 1993.  HME / UoE, Starlink. For DTACACHE must include SAE_PAR
C                     and DAT_PAR as well.
