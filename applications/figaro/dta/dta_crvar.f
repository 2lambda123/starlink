      SUBROUTINE DTA_CRVAR (NAME,TYPE,STATUS)
C
C     D T A _ C R V A R
C
C     Creates a named data structure variable, of a given
C     type.  The environment of the variable must already
C     exist; that is, the variable must have a name of the
C     form 'environment.object' (environment may have
C     components as well) and there must already exist a
C     structure with the name 'environment'.  The object
C     itself must not already exist.  Dimensional information
C     is obtained from NAME as well - ie name can be of the
C     form 'environment.obj[dimension list]', where the
C     dimension list is a set of integers separated by commas.
C
C     Parameters -   (">" input, "<" output)
C
C     (>) NAME     (Character) The name of the object to be
C                  created.  The form is as described above, 
C                  ie a standard data structure name, and
C                  must be terminated either by a blank or by
C                  the end of the string. NAME can be upper or
C                  lower case, or a mixture.
C     (>) TYPE     (Character) The type of the variable. Can be
C                  any of the allowed types (bit,byte,short,
C                  int,long,float,double,char,file), or
C                  any other string.  If it is not one of the
C                  recognised types, it is treated as a user-
C                  defined structure name.  TYPE is case-
C                  independent, and must end with a blank or
C                  the end of the string.  Note that if TYPE 
C                  contains characters (such as '-') that would
C                  be rejected by HDS, the actual type used will
C                  have underscores substituted.
C     (<) STATUS   (Integer) Returns a status code.
C                  0 => OK
C                  DTA_NOENV => The environment does not exist
C                  DTA_EXISTS => The object already exists
C                  Lower level routines may generate other error
C                  codes.

C     Modified:
C
C     12th Mar 1986.  KS / AAO.  Re-written to use HDS routines.
C     8th  Jan 1992.  KS / AAO.  Syntax of include statements changed to 
C                     remove VMS logical names and to use lower case, to 
C                     enable compilation on a SUN.
C     24th Jan 1992.  KS / AAO. Calls to EMS added to control error reporting.
C     12th Mar 1993.  HME / UoE. Changed CHARACTER*15 to *(DAT__SZLOC).

C     It looks OK, so get the HDS object type corresponding to 
C     the DTA type specified.  Note the complication that since
C     HDS supports character strings, it has been decided to treat
C     a DTA array CHARS[n,m] of type CHAR, for example, as an
C     HDS array CHARS[m] of type _CHAR*n.  This seems a more natural
C     thing to do, but it complicates things slightly.

C
C     Now create the data object.  Note that at this point we
C     don't bother getting a locator, so we can't put it in the
C     name cache.
