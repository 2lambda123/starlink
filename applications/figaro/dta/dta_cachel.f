      SUBROUTINE DTA_CACHEL (NAME,LEVELS,LASTC,LEV,LOC,STATUS)
C
C     D T A _ C A C H E L
C
C     Locates a name cache entry for a named object.  The cache
C     may contain the complete name, in which case no further
C     searches through the data structure will be needed.  More
C     likely, the cache will contain an entry for a structure
C     name one or more levels up from the name of the object.
C     At the very least, as long as the file in question has been
C     opened, the cache will contain the top level name.  If a
C     higher level name is found, this will provide a starting
C     point for a search down through the structure.
C
C     Parameters -   (">" input, "<" output)
C
C     (>) NAME     (Character) The full name of the object.  This
C                  should have been analysed earlier by DTA_SPLITN
C                  to obtain the information in LEVELS and LASTC.
C                  NAME should be in upper case.
C     (>) LEVELS   (Integer) The number of levels of name in the
C                  object name.
C     (>) LASTC    (Integer LASTC(LEVELS)) Array giving the positions
C                  in NAME of the last characters of each of the
C                  components of NAME.
C     (<) LEV      (Integer) The level at which a cache entry was
C                  found.
C     (<) LOC      (Character) The HDS locator for the object
C                  that was found in the name cache.  This will be
C                  either the object itself or a higher level
C                  structure record.
C     (<) STATUS   (Integer) Returns a status code.
C                  0 => OK, an entry was found.
C                  DTA_NOFILE => No entry found, file cannot be open.

C     (>) LOCN2    The second level cache location table
C     (>) CACHET   The top level cache name table
C     (>) LOCNT    The top level cache location table
C     (>) CACHEI   Flag to indicate cache initialised
C     (<) LOOKUPS  # Cache lookups

C     (<) COMPS    Total number of string comparisons made

C     Modified:
C
C     10th Mar 1986.  KS / AAO.  Changed for use with HDS based
C                     version of DTA_ routines.  Locators are now
C                     character*15 instead of integer.
C     15th May 1986.  KS / AAO.  Statistics variables added.  Search
C                     of bottom level bypassed if LEVELS is too low.
C      6th Sep 1990.  SMB / ROE. If an object with more than 4 levels
C                     was searched for, this routine missed any entries
C                     in the bottom level cache which were one or more
C                     levels up from the object. The net effect was that
C                     the cache ended up containing duplicate entries
C                     with different locators.
C                     To fix this problem, the routine was modified to 
C                     check for matches at all levels from LEVELS down
C                     to 4 in the bottom level cache.
C     12th Apr 1991.  KS / AAO. Recoded to try to minimise the number of
C                     long character string comparisions made.
C     8th  Jan 1992.  KS/AAO.  Syntax of include statements changed to remove
C                     VMS logical names and to use lower case, to enable
C                     compilation on a SUN.
C     12th Apr 1993.  HME / UoE, Starlink. For DTACACHE must include SAE_PAR
C                     and DAT_PAR as well.
