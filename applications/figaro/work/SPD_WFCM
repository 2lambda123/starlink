*  Name:
*     SPD_WFCM

*  Purpose:
*     Common block include file, internal to WORK library.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     INCLUDE 'SPD_WFCM'

*  Description:
*     This file declares the common block used by the line fit routines
*     in the WORK library to transfer information through the NAG
*     minimisation routine to its objective function. "Line" fit here
*     means anything of which up to 6 entities are guessed and fitted.
*     One group of routines achieves a fit of diluted Planck functions.
*
*     This file should be used only internally by the SPD_WF* routines,
*     other routines are not supposed to access the common block
*     directly.

*  Constants:
*     MAXCMP = INTEGER
*        The number of line components provided for.

*  Variables:
*     DCONT = DOUBLE PRECISION
*        The constant continuum underlying the line profiles.
*     FSCALE = DOUBLE PRECISION
*        Scaling factor. The objective function is proportional to
*        1/FSCALE. FSCALE should be such that the objective function is
*        of order unity near its minimum.
*     PARNO( 3*MAXCMP ) = INTEGER
*        Permutation vector for parameters.
*        PAR1(PARNO(I)) corresponds to PAR0(I). PAR1 is not part of this
*        COMMON block.
*        First in the array PAR1 come all the free line centres in
*        ascending order of component number. Then come all free line
*        peaks in ascending order of component number. Then come all
*        free line dispersions.
*        Last in the array PAR1 come all fixed or tied or unused centres
*        in descending order of component number. Before that come all
*        fixed or tied or unused peaks in descending order of component
*        number. Before that come all fixed or tied of unused line
*        dispersions in descending order of component number.
*     PARFLG( 3*MAXCMP ) = INTEGER
*        A packed version of the fit flags:
*        PARFLG={CFLAGS(1) ... CFLAGS(NCOMP),NCOMP+1,...,MAXCMP,
*                PFLAGS(1) ... PFLAGS(NCOMP),NCOMP+1,...,MAXCMP,
*                SFLAGS(1) ... SFLAGS(NCOMP),NCOMP+1,...,MAXCMP}
*        For each component I a value e.g. CFLAGS(I)=0 indicates
*        that CENTRE(I) holds a guess which is free to be fitted.
*        A positive value CFLAGS(I)=I indicates that CENTRE(I) is fixed.
*        A positive value CFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that CENTRE(I) has to
*        keep a fixed offset from CENTRE(J). A positive value PFLAGS(I)
*        or SFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that PEAK(I) or SIGMA(I) has to keep
*        a fixed ratio to PEAK(J) or SIGMA(J).
*        Deviating from CFLAGS etc., unused components' parameters are
*        flagged as fixed.
*     PAR0( 3*MAXCMP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION
*        A packed version of the unscaled guess parameters:
*        PAR0={CENTRE(1) ... CENTRE(NCOMP),0,0,...,0,
*                PEAK(1) ...   PEAK(NCOMP),0,0,...,0,
*               SIGMA(1) ...  SIGMA(NCOMP),1,1,...,1}
*        Deviating from CENTRE etc., unused components' parameters are
*        set to 0 or 1, whichever causes less harm.
*     NCOMP = INTEGER
*        Number of line components.
*     NDATA = INTEGER
*        Number of data points in spectrum. This is the dimension of
*        each of the four vectors behind the pointer DATAP.
*     DATAP = INTEGER
*        Pointer to a packed array of four vectors of length NDATA. That
*        is to say, %VAL(DATAP) is a REAL array DATA(4*NDATA).
