*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_WZDE

*  Purpose:
*     Parameters and variances of multi-triangle profile.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_WZDE( NCOMP, FITDIM, CFLAGS, PFLAGS, SFLAGS, PEAK,
*        FWHM, VARSCL, COVAR, FLUX, CVAR, PVAR, WVAR, FVAR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine takes fit parameters, fit flags, and the covariance
*     of parameters of a multi-triangle profile fit and works out more
*     (dependent) parameters and all parameter variances.
*
*     The function described by the fit parameters is the sum of up to
*     six triangular profiles. Each profile is specified by centre,
*     peak and full width at half maximum. Each of these 18 or less
*     parameters may be fixed, free, or tied to the corresponding
*     parameter of another component. These parameter properties are
*     specified by flags. Ties mean constant offset for centres and
*     constant ratio for peaks and widths. Any component can be tied
*     only to an earlier component (with smaller array index) and only
*     to a free parameter. For the free parameters the covariance matrix
*     is given to this routine.
*
*     This routine calculates the additional parameter line integral for
*     each component. It also calculates the variances of all
*     parameters, taking care of the interrelations (covariance) between
*     them.

*  Arguments:
*     NCOMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of components.
*     FITDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensions of the covariance matrix. Usually this is the
*        number of free parameters, but it must be at least 1.
*     CFLAGS( 6 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        For each component I a value CFLAGS(I)=0 indicates that
*        CENTRE(I) holds a guess which is free to be fitted.
*        A positive value CFLAGS(I)=I indicates that CENTRE(I) is fixed.
*        A positive value CFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that CENTRE(I) has to
*        keep a fixed offset from CENTRE(J).
*     PFLAGS( 6 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        For each component I a value PFLAGS(I)=0 indicates that
*        PEAK(I) holds a guess which is free to be fitted.
*        A positive value PFLAGS(I)=I indicates that PEAK(I) is fixed.
*        A positive value PFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that PEAK(I) has to
*        keep a fixed ratio to PEAK(J).
*     SFLAGS( 6 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        For each component I a value SFLAGS(I)=0 indicates that
*        FWHM(I) holds a guess which is free to be fitted.
*        A positive value SFLAGS(I)=I indicates that FWHM(I) is fixed.
*        A positive value SFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that FWHM(I) has to
*        keep a fixed ratio to FWHM(J).
*     PEAK( 6 ) = REAL (Given)
*        Peak height for each component.
*     FWHM( 6 ) = REAL (Given)
*        Full width at half maximum for each component.
*     VARSCL = REAL (Given)
*        Scaling factor for the covariance matrix. That matrix is not
*        taken literally here. Each time a matrix element is used, it is
*        multiplied with this number to be sure to have the actual
*        covariance. The motivation is that while fitting variances may
*        have been unknown. Then the matrix would be only proportional,
*        but not equal, to the covariance matrix.
*        Usually, if variances were known, this factor will be one. And
*        if variances were unknown, this factor will be the square of
*        rms.
*     COVAR( FITDIM, FITDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        VARSCL * COVAR is the matrix of covariances between free
*        parameters.
*     FLUX( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Line integral for each component.
*     CVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of centre position for each component.
*     PVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of peak height for each component.
*     WVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of FWHM for each component.
*     FVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of line integral for each component.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
