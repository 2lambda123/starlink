      SUBROUTINE SPD_WZPKR( LMAX, CLM, CRSL, NEEDC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_WZPK{DR}

*  Purpose:
*     Add up matrix rows.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_WZPKR( LMAX, CLM, CRSL, NEEDC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine adds up the rows of a given matrix and stores the
*     results in a vector. If the given matrix is found to be diagonal
*     or to contain only bad and zero values, this is signalled by a
*     logical switch.
*
*     The result vector component is never set bad. If the sum along
*     the row turns out to be zero, either the data value is perfect, or
*     the data value is bad. In the first case the covariance row sum
*     must be zero as well, in the second case the value set here does
*     not matter.

*  Arguments:
*     LMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of matrix columns and rows. Also the length of the
*        result vector.
*     CLM( LMAX, LMAX ) = REAL (Given)
*        The given matrix.
*     CRSL( LMAX ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The vector of sums of matrix rows.
*     NEEDC = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        False if the vector of row sums does not contain more
*        information than the matrix diagonal.
*        As long as the matrix contained any off-diagonal, non-zero,
*        non-bad elements, this logical will be true.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
