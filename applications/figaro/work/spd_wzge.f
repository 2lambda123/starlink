*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_WZGE

*  Purpose:
*     Variances of multi-Planck profile.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_WZGE( NCOMP, FITDIM, CFLAGS, PFLAGS, SFLAGS,
*        VARSCL, COVAR, CVAR, PVAR, WVAR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine takes fit flags and the covariance of parameters of a
*     multi-Planck profile fit and works the parameter variances.
*
*     The function described by the fit parameters is the sum of up to
*     six diluted Planck profiles. Each profile is specified by three
*     parameters. Each of these 18 or less parameters may be fixed,
*     free, or tied to the corresponding parameter of another component.
*     These parameter properties are specified by flags. Ties mean
*     constant offset. Any component can be tied only to an earlier
*     component (with smaller array index) and only to a free parameter.
*     For the free parameters the covariance matrix is given to this
*     routine.

*  Arguments:
*     NCOMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of components.
*     FITDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensions of the covariance matrix. Usually this is the
*        number of free parameters, but it must be at least 1.
*     CFLAGS( 6 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        For each component I a value CFLAGS(I)=0 indicates that
*        CENTRE(I) holds a guess which is free to be fitted.
*        A positive value CFLAGS(I)=I indicates that CENTRE(I) is fixed.
*        A positive value CFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that CENTRE(I) has to
*        keep a fixed offset from CENTRE(J).
*     PFLAGS( 6 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        For each component I a value PFLAGS(I)=0 indicates that
*        PEAK(I) holds a guess which is free to be fitted.
*        A positive value PFLAGS(I)=I indicates that PEAK(I) is fixed.
*        A positive value PFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that PEAK(I) has to
*        keep a fixed offset to PEAK(J).
*     SFLAGS( 6 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        For each component I a value SFLAGS(I)=0 indicates that
*        FWHM(I) holds a guess which is free to be fitted.
*        A positive value SFLAGS(I)=I indicates that FWHM(I) is fixed.
*        A positive value SFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that FWHM(I) has to
*        keep a fixed offset to FWHM(J).
*     VARSCL = REAL (Given)
*        Scaling factor for the covariance matrix. That matrix is not
*        taken literally here. Each time a matrix element is used, it is
*        multiplied with this number to be sure to have the actual
*        covariance. The motivation is that while fitting variances may
*        have been unknown. Then the matrix would be only proportional,
*        but not equal, to the covariance matrix.
*        Usually, if variances were known, this factor will be one. And
*        if variances were unknown, this factor will be the square of
*        rms.
*     COVAR( FITDIM, FITDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        VARSCL * COVAR is the matrix of covariances between free
*        parameters.
*     CVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of first parameter for each component.
*     PVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of second parameter for each component.
*     WVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of third parameter for each component.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
