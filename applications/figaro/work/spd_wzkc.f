*  Name:
*     SPD_WZKC

*  Purpose:
*     FDB: calculates multi-arc line group parameters.

*  Language:
*     Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_WZKC( INFO,
*        max_features, positions, num_actv_ftrs, meta_scope,
*        left_offset, right_offset, ratios, n_samples,
*        next_index, prev_index, status )

*  Description:
*     This is a modification of Dave Mills' routine CALC_META_FTRS (cf.
*     Mills 1992). "FDB" stands for "feature data base", which is a data
*     base of known features in arc spectra.
*
*     This routine calculates the possible 'meta-features' present in
*     the observed set of features. Meta here means that multiple
*     features are re-interpreted as a single meta feature. The measure
*     here uses combinations of 5 roughly adjacent features as one
*     meta-feature. This routine calculates the ratios which
*     characterise such meta-features in terms of ratios of distance
*     from central component to its first and second  left and right
*     neighbours.

*  Arguments:
*     INFO = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, some messages are issued.
*     max_features = INTEGER (Given)
*        Maximum number of observed features per order
*     positions() = REAL (Given)
*        Observed x-coords of active features
*     num_actv_ftrs = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of active features to consider
*     meta_scope = INTEGER (Given)
*        Scope of meta features (ie out to n'th neighbours)
*     left_offset() = BYTE (Returned)
*        Which left neighbour was used
*     right_offset() = BYTE (Returned)
*        Which right neighbour was used
*     next_index() = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Pointer to entry with next greatest ratio
*     prev_index() = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Pointer to entry with previous greatest ratio
*     ratios() = REAL (Returned)
*        Ratios of features inter-neigbour distances the list is not
*        sorted into order as this  takes too long. Instead it is
*        treated as a linked list of entries , with next_index() and
*        prev_index() showing the order of entries
*     n_samples = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of entries in the above arrays
*     status = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Input/Output status conditions
*        This is a status for use in the FDB routines, not a Starlink
*        inherited status.
