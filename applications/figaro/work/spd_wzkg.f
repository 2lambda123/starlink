*  Name:
*     SPD_WZKG

*  Purpose:
*     FDB: check candidates meta-features

*  Language:
*     Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_WZKG( INFO, MAX_ARC_LINES, FTR_LIST,
*        best_dispersion, best_ftr, best_distances, best_prev_ftr,
*        best_prev_ftr2, best_next_ftr, best_next_ftr2,
*        num_active_ftrs, meta_ftrs, meta_ftr_guess, meta_count,
*        status )

*  Description:
*     This is a modification of Dave Mills' routine TEST_META_FTRS (cf.
*     Mills 1992). "FDB" stands for "feature data base", which is a data
*     base of known features in arc spectra.
*
*     This routine searches the table of the top 'max_idents'
*     identification candidates for observed features. It locates the
*     very best set of such identifications by applying the following
*     criteria :
*
*         At least one of the two neighbours predicted by the
*         identification must actually appear as an identification of a
*         feature in a subsequent entry.
*
*         The dispersions calculated by subsequent 'pairs' of consistent
*         feature indentifications must be in agreement to at least a 
*         (user tunable) threshold (meta_disp_thresh).
*
*         A set of n+1 consistent features is a better candidate
*         solution than any set of only n features
*
*         For two sets both of n candidates , the better one is that
*         which has a lower origin distance in n-d space from the
*         'perfect solution'.

*  Arguments:

*        Index numbers of candidates in the solution.
