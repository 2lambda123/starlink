      SUBROUTINE SPD_WZPCD( INFO, KMAX, LMAX, XK, WK, XL, WL, OKL,
     :   STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_WZPC{DR}

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate pixel overlap matrix.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_WZPCD( INFO, KMAX, LMAX, XK, WK, XL, WL, OKL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine calculates the matrix of overlaps between two sets
*     of one-dimensional pixel arrays.
*
*     If the first set of pixels was contiguous and the pixel from the
*     second set is neither the first nor the last in the second set,
*     then the sum (over the first set) of overlaps should equal the
*     width (from the second set). This routine issues a warning if this
*     is not even nearly fulfilled.
*
*     This routine is originally written for use by Specdre's RESAMP
*     application. The theoretical foundations are discussed by
*     Meyerdierks (1992). The overlap matrix is defined as
*
*        O'_kl = min{ x_l + w_l/2; x_k + w_k/2 }
*              - max{ x_l - w_l/2; x_k - w_k/2 }     if > 0
*
*        O'_kl = 0                                   else

*  Arguments:
*     INFO = LOGICAL (Given)
*        False if warning message about contiguousness is to be
*        suppressed.
*     KMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of the first array of pixel positions and widths.
*        This is also the length of matrix rows, i.e. the first
*        dimension of the matrix.
*     LMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The length of the second array of pixel positions and widths.
*        This is also the length of matrix columns, i.e. the second
*        dimension of the matrix.
*     XK( KMAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The first array of positions.
*     WK( KMAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The first array of widths.
*     XL( LMAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The second array of positins.
*     WL( LMAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The second array of widths.
*     OKL( KMAX, LMAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The matrix of overlaps between pixel in either array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
