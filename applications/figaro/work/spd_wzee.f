*  Name:
*     SPD_WZEE

*  Purpose:
*     Parameters and variances of multi-Gauss profile.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_WZEE( NCOMP, FITDIM, CFLAGS, PFLAGS, SFLAGS, PEAK,
*        SIGMA, VARSCL, COVAR, FWHM, FLUX, CVAR, PVAR, SVAR, WVAR, FVAR,
*        STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine takes fit parameters, fit flags, and the covariance
*     of parameters of a multi-Gauss profile fit and works out more
*     (dependent) parameters and all parameter variances.
*
*     The function described by the fit parameters is the sum of up to
*     six Gauss profiles. Each Gauss profile is specified by centre,
*     peak and dispersion. Each of these 18 or less parameters may be
*     fixed, free, or tied to the corresponding parameter of another
*     component. These parameter properties are specified by flags. Ties
*     mean constant offset for centres and constant ratio for peaks and
*     dispersions. Any component can be tied only to an earlier
*     component (with smaller array index) and only to a free parameter.
*     For the free parameters the covariance matrix is given to this
*     routine.
*
*     This routine calculates the additional parameters full width at
*     half maximum (FWHM) and line integral for each component. It also
*     calculates the variances of all parameters, taking care of the
*     interrelations (covariance) between them.

*  Arguments:
*     NCOMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of Gauss components.
*     FITDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensions of the covariance matrix. Usually this is the
*        number of free parameters, but it must be at least 1.
*     CFLAGS( MAXGAU ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        For each Gauss component I a value CFLAGS(I)=0 indicates that
*        CENTRE(I) holds a guess which is free to be fitted.
*        A positive value CFLAGS(I)=I indicates that CENTRE(I) is fixed.
*        A positive value CFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that CENTRE(I) has to
*        keep a fixed offset from CENTRE(J).
*     PFLAGS( MAXGAU ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        For each Gauss component I a value PFLAGS(I)=0 indicates that
*        PEAK(I) holds a guess which is free to be fitted.
*        A positive value PFLAGS(I)=I indicates that PEAK(I) is fixed.
*        A positive value PFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that PEAK(I) has to
*        keep a fixed ratio to PEAK(J).
*     SFLAGS( MAXGAU ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        For each Gauss component I a value SFLAGS(I)=0 indicates that
*        SIGMA(I) holds a guess which is free to be fitted.
*        A positive value SFLAGS(I)=I indicates that SIGMA(I) is fixed.
*        A positive value SFLAGS(I)=J<I indicates that SIGMA(I) has to
*        keep a fixed ratio to SIGMA(J).
*     PEAK( MAXGAU ) = REAL (Given)
*        Peak height for each Gauss component.
*     SIGMA( MAXGAU ) = REAL (Given)
*        Dispersion for each Gauss component.
*     VARSCL = REAL (Given)
*        Scaling factor for the covariance matrix. That matrix is not
*        taken literally here. Each time a matrix element is used, it is
*        multiplied with this number to be sure to have the actual
*        covariance. The motivation is that while fitting variances may
*        have been unknown. Then the matrix would be only proportional,
*        but not equal, to the covariance matrix.
*        Usually, if variances were known, this factor will be one. And
*        if variances were unknown, this factor will be the square of
*        rms.
*     COVAR( FITDIM, FITDIM ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        VARSCL * COVAR is the matrix of covariances between free
*        parameters.
*     FWHM( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Full width at half maximum (FWHM) for each Gauss component.
*     FLUX( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Line integral for each Gauss component.
*     CVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of centre position for each Gauss component.
*     PVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of peak height for each Gauss component.
*     SVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of sigma dispersion for each Gauss component.
*     WVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of FWHM for each Gauss component.
*     FVAR( NCOMP ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Variance of line integral for each Gauss component.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
