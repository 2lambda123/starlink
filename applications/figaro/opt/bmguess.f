* Name:
*    BMGUESS

* Invocation:
*    CALL BMGUESS(GUESS,WORK,MINHT,SIGRED,DECCNTR,FUNCT)

* Purpose:
*  Guess a multiple Gaussian/Lorentzian to fit to data

* Description:
*  To guess the parameters for a multiple gaussian fit in batch mode, no
*  previous fit is assumed. This routine will keep on guessing further
*  gaussians until one fails to pass on the values of width or the
*  minimum height from tolerances, or until deccntr(FIT_NCMP) gaussians
*  are guessed. After finding these, this routine allows the best
*  guesses, in terms of the value of Akaike's Information Criterion, to
*  be selected (this selects the number of components). It is advisable
*  to use a test such as this for determining the number of components,
*  and this can be done here or after the optimisation.

* Arguments:
*    MINHT = REAL (Given)
*        Minimum height
*    SIGRED = REAL (Given)
*        Amount by which sigma can exceed max
*                            value and is reduced to value rather
*                            than component rejected.
*    FUNCT = REAL (Given)
*        Function to evaluate Gaussian or whatever
*    GUESS(4,*) = REAL ARRAY (Returned)
*        Fit parameters (scaled)

*                             base,sigma,height,centre
*    WORK(M*3) = REAL ARRAY (Workspace)
* Global variables:
*    MINSIG = REAL (Given)

*        Maximum sigma
*    MPTS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of points in range
*    DATSC = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        DATA scaling factor
*    DENSC = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)

* Author:
*   T.N.Wilkins Manchester September 1987
* History:
*   TNW 26/10/88 PTR1 added
*   TNW 23/11/88 Changed to no longer use common block
*   TNW Cambridge, 9/5/89 SIGRED added, and relevant part of routine
*   made to work (bug fix)
*   TNW 25/4/90, Use WORK rather than DENS for finding peaks. Also minor
*                change to smoothing.
*   TNW 22/4/91, Minimum width set (sigma) to 1 for gettting range for
*                centroid calculations.
*   TNW 17/9/91 Changes to allow use for absorption lines, etc.
*    "  20/9/91 Made single precision almost completely
*    " 2/12/91 All workspace passed as WORK array (PTR1 removed)
*    " 9,12/6/92 Minor improvements
*    " 31/7/92 Now handles all lines as emission, converting at start and
*              end. This avoids large numbers of if statements.
*    " 17/8/92 Accept funct as argument, so can deal with different models.
*    " 21/8/92 Use opt_cmn/dynamic_mem
*  TNW: 28th June 1993, reflect changes in opt_cmn
*  TNW: 29th June 1993, N removed
*  TNW: 27th January 1994, a little more checking on setting smaxsig

*  has zero for its minimum value. If base is negative then completely
*  remove it. For absorption lines we take the base as half way between
*  the maximum value (which for scaled data is 1) and the value we
*  obtained. The reason for only partially subtracting the base is that
*  it is common for the base value we've obtained to be biased by lines,
*  which would lead to under-estimating the line strengths, or even
*  missing them altogether.
