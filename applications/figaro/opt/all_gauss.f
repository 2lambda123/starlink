* Name:
*    ALL_GAUSS

* Invocation:
*    CALL ALL_GAUSS(M,N,XC,RC,AJC,AJTJC,MAX_PARMS,GC,DATA,DENS,
*                       WEIGHT,THE_SIGN,START,END)

* Purpose:
*   Fit a single gaussian to all lines specified
*   simultaneously.

* Description:
*   Fit a single gaussian to all lines specified
*   simultaneously. In this model the REDSHIFT and
*   WIDTH of each gaussian are identical, whereas the
*   BASE and HEIGHT are variable. In principal this should
*   give better answers for both REDSHIFT and WIDTH for
*   weak data. The method of calculation uses a standard LSQ
*   we form
*   fc = sum {[( gausian + base - data) * weight]**2}
*   were the sum is over the number of lines.
*   In other words.
*   The data is partioned into seperate sum of squares for
*   each line and these are then added in quadrature to form
*   the total sum of squares to be minimized.

*   This routine assumes that ALL lines have been reduced
*   to a common DATA axis  = REDSHIFT prior to entry.
*   In addition it is assumed that the SCALING of DENS
*   has been achieved using a SINGLE value of DENMAX and DENMIN
*   over all the included points.
*

* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
* Each line is assumed to have the same REDSHIFT and WIDTH
* The HEIGHT is independent for each line and in addition
* each line is allowed a varaible BASE. Thus number of
* Gaussians is

      n_gauss = (n - SHARED_OFFSET ) / PARS_PER_G

* zero out the derivatives and residuals arrays so that
* all points not refering to the current gaussian are correctly
* set to 0. we then only have to fill in those
* entries requried for the current gaussian.

      do i = 1,m
        do k = 1,n
          ajc(i,k) = 0.0d0
        end do
        rc(i) = 0.0d0
      end do

*    loop over the gaussians
*    determiing the residuals and the derivatives.
      do k = 1 , n_gauss

* break the data up into its start and end locations
* we need to do this because we must accumualte seperate
* derviatives for each HEIGHT and BASE

        do i = start(k) , end(k)

          z_score    = ( data(i) - xc(REDSHIFT) ) / xc(WIDTH)
          Z_score2   = - 0.5d0 * z_score * z_score
          g_exp      = exp ( z_score2 )

* work out which paramters corrspond to the HEIGHT and BASE
* of this particular line

          i_base    = (k-1) * PARS_PER_G + SHARED_OFFSET + 1
          i_height  = i_base + 1

* form total gaussian for this line

          current_gaussian   = abs(xc(i_height)) * g_exp
          current_gaussian   = the_sign *  current_gaussian

* the residuals

          rc(i)  = current_gaussian - dens(i) + xc( i_base )
          rc(i)  = rc(i) * weight (i)

* form the gradient vector appropriate for least squares
* first we do the BASE and HEIGHT as these are different
* for EACH gaussian in this model.

*   diff wrt b

          ajc(i, i_base) = weight(i)

*   diff wrt h1

          ajc(i,i_height) = ajc(i, i_base) * g_exp

* derivative mulitiplication factor for REDSHIFT
* and redshift.

          red_mult   = z_score / xc(WIDTH)
          width_mult = red_mult * z_score

* we can now work out the contributions made by this line to
* the derivatives of REDSHIFT and WIDTH which are the same
* for each gaussian. We thus have to sum over gaussians
* to obtain the total partial derivatives.

* first get contribution from this gaussian

          g_REDSHIFT   = current_gaussian * red_mult
          g_WIDTH      = g_REDSHIFT * z_score

          ajc(i, REDSHIFT) = gc(i_base) * g_REDSHIFT
          ajc(i, WIDTH)    =  gc(i_base) * g_WIDTH

        end do
