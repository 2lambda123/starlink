*  Name:
*     FLA_OPEXT

*  Purpose:
*     Performs an optimal extraction and reconfiguration for a FLAIR
*     frame.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FLA_OPEXT( DIM1, DIM2, INARR, INVAR, WEIGHT, NFIBRE,
*                     OUTARR, OUTVAR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine extracts FLAIR spectra from two-dimensional images
*     and stores them in an output array configured with increasing
*     wavelength along the x axis, and a spectrum per line.  It performs
*     an optimal extraction using Horne's algorithm (1986, PASP 98,
*     609) and an average profile of the relative response of the fibres
*     in each column.  The spectra are delineated by bad values in the
*     profile array.

*  Arguments:
*     DIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the input data array and length of the
*        weight array.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the input data array.
*     INARR( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The data array whose spectra are to be extracted optimally and
*        reconfigured.  Dispersion is along the y-axis and wavelength
*        decreases as y increases.
*     INVAR( DIM1, DIM2 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The variance array associated with the input data array.
*     WEIGHT( DIM1 ) = REAL (Given)
*        The profile or weights to be used during an optimal extraction.
*        Bad values must separate the individual spectra.
*     NFIBRE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of fibres to extract, and the second dimension of
*        the output arrays.
*     OUTARR( DIM2, NFIBRE ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The array of extracted spectra.
*     OUTVAR( DIM2, NFIBRE ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The variance associated with the array of extracted spectra.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
