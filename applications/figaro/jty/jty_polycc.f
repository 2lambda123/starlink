      SUBROUTINE JTY_POLYCC(NX,NY,SCALE,COEFF,PCOEFF)
* Routine to convert coefficients of a 2-d Legendre polynomial to 
* coefficients of a plain polynomial
* The coefficients are stored as NX polynomials of order NY-1.
* Low order coefficient comes first, and the low order coefficient
* of the x polynomial is obtained by evaluating the first y polynomial.
