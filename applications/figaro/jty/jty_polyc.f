      SUBROUTINE JTY_POLYC(NC,SCALE,COEFF,PCOEFF)
C Routine to convert coefficients of a 1-d Legendre polynomial to 
C coefficients of a plain polynomial.
C The NC coefficients are stored with the low order coefficient first.

C History:  Original version J. Tonry.
C Modified: TDCA 18-FEB-1999. Size of COEFF and PCOEFF arrays changed
C           from 1 to 3. Minor style changes.
C Modified: TDCA 19-MAY-1999. Intermediate steps added to some 
C           calculations to avoid rounding errors.
