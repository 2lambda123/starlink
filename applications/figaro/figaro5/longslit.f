      subroutine longslit( STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    LONGSLIT

* Invocation:
*    CALL LONGSLIT( STATUS )

* Purpose:
*   Longslit rotation curve and line profile analysis

* Description:
*   LONGSLIT can fit Gaussians, skew Gaussians, Lorentzians and Cauchy
*   functions to line profiles, and can carry out line profile analysis to
*   produce the Whittle and Heckman asymmetry parameters. Much of this
*   can be carried out in batch mode.
*     This program generates rotation curves from 2D data, for a number
*   of emission/absorption lines.
*     Options are available to automatically fit each line in the
*   spectrum or to do it in an interactive manner allowing unsatisfactory
*   fits to be rejected. Unsatisfactory fits may then be refitted on a
*   second pass.
*     For each line a table is created containing all the fit parameters
*   as a function of crossection.If the data has been block averaged in
*   an range of XSECTS the average XSECT value and the XSECT range are
*   computed and stored.
*     In manual mode the user can sweep through the XSECTS choosing
*   different BLOCKINGS and line types repeatedly until he either
*   accepts the fit or issues an instruction not to fit a given range of
*   XSECTS.
*     Continuum Fitting is provided in two ways. Firstly a GLOBAL
*   continuum may be defined for each block of data. This is a continuum
*   which is fitted to all regions of the spectrum which do NOT contain
*   lines. A variety of models are available.
*   Chebyshev Polynomials, Splines, (Power Law, Black Body, Black Body
*   with optical depth cuttoff, Empirical, and Balmer Continuum).
*   Secondly, A local continuum may be applied to each INDIVIDUAL
*   line. This continuum is applied in addition to that created
*   by GLOBAL but is confined to the regions of the spectra
*   containing a particular line. Because most of the allowed
*   line options also fit a FLAT base the combination of these
*   fits can be made to match even the most complex continua
*   The types of allowed continuum models for INDIVIDUAL is
*   restricted to Spline, Flat or Chebyshev.
*     It is possible to Edit the results cube created by LONGSLIT
*   and to create new Synthetic spectra by doing model -data
*   manipulations or from the models themselves. During this
*   process several usefull things can be done to the output
*   spectra, notably changing their Redshift, applying or
*   removing Reddening.
*     A similar approach creating Sky subracted data and using sky
*   lines for correcting for instrumental vignetting is also possible.
*     Rotation curves in individual lines are produced as requested in
*   the PLOT mode. In addition it is possible to calculate a mean
*   rotation curve. In the current release the user now has complete
*   control over the plotting parameters and the lines being
*   plotted.

* Parameters:-

*                a .Z.DATA component. This should also have a .X.DATA
*                array which contains the wavelengths of the lines.
*                For the identification files supplied with the program
*                the units should be Angstroms, but if the user supplies
*                his/her own files, this need not apply, although some
