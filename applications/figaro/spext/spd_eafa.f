      SUBROUTINE SPD_EAFA( NDF, XLOC, AXIS, ACCESS, TYPE,
     :   PNTR, ONDF, NELM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_EAFA

*  Purpose:
*     Access widths in AXIS or SPECWIDS structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_EAFA( NDF, XLOC, AXIS, ACCESS, TYPE,
*        PNTR, ONDF, NELM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine will access an array of width values wherever they
*     are. Mostly this will be from the AXIS structure of the given NDF.
*     This routine will however find out whether the axis number is that
*     of the spectroscopic axis. It accesses the SPECWIDS structure in
*     the Specdre Extension instead, if (i) the given HDS locator is
*     valid, and (ii) the requested axis is the spectroscopic axis, and
*     (iii) the SPECWIDS or SPECVALS structures exist in the Specdre
*     Extension. Which source was used - and thus whether the mapped
*     centre array is one- or multi-dimensional - is signalled to the
*     calling routine by the returned NDF identifier being valid or
*     NDF__NOID. If the returned Extension NDF identifier is valid, then
*     that NDF will have the same shape, size and bounds as the given
*     main NDF. If the main NDF was not a base NDF then the Extension
*     NDF will be an NDF section as well.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the given main NDF.
*     XLOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The HDS locator of the Specdre Extension. This should be an
*        extension of the main NDF. If the Specdre Extension does not
*        exist, then this argument must be given as DAT__NOLOC.
*     AXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the axis to be accessed.
*     ACCESS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The access mode required. This can be 'READ', 'WRITE', or
*        'UPDATE'.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The numeric type for mapping the centre array. This can be
*        '_REAL', '_DOUBLE', or blank. If given blank and if the array
*        is stored '_DOUBLE', then it is mapped in double precision. If
*        given blank and if the array is not stored '_DOUBLE', then it
*        is mapped '_REAL'. In effect, usually a blank type
*        specification causes the array to be mapped with the stored
*        type. On return, TYPE is '_REAL' or '_DOUBLE' and tells the
*        type actually used for mapping.
*     PNTR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The pointer to which the width array is mapped.
*     ONDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The identifier of the SPECWIDS NDF, which is a component of the
*        Specdre Extension. This will be returned as NDF__NOID if no NDF
*        was accessed and the array was mapped from the main NDF's AXIS
*        structure.
*     NELM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of elements in the mapped array. If taken from the
*        main NDF's AXIS structure, this will be the length of the axis.
*        If taken from the main NDF's Specdre Extension, this will be
*        the size of the NDF identified by ONDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     This routine recognises the Specdre Extension v. 0.7.
