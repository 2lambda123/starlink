      SUBROUTINE SPD_EAFD( NDF, XLOC, ACCESS, TYPE,
     :   PNTR, ONDF, NELM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_EAFD

*  Purpose:
*     Access widths in SPECWIDS structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_EAFD( NDF, XLOC, ACCESS, TYPE, PNTR, ONDF, NELM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine will access an array of spectroscopic pixel widths
*     from the SPECWIDS structure in the Specdre Extension. Should this
*     not exist, it will be created from (i) the SPECVALS structure
*     or (ii) the spectroscopic axis in the main NDF's AXIS structure.
*
*     The action of this routine depends on the presence of the SPECWIDS
*     structure, of the SPECVALS structure and on the access mode:
*     -  If the SPECWIDS structure already exists, then this routine
*        will access a section with the same bounds as the main NDF.
*     -  If SPECWIDS are absent, SPECVALS exist, and access is READ,
*        then a temporary NDF with the same bounds as the given main NDF
*        is created, its values are derived from SPECVALS.
*     -  If SPECWIDS are absent, SPECVALS exist, and access is WRITE or
*        UPDATE, then a permanent NDF with the same bounds as the base
*        NDF of which the main NDF is a section is created, its values
*        are derived from SPECVALS. Only a section of the new NDF is
*        accessed, its bounds match the main NDF.
*     -  If SPECWIDS and SPECVALS are absent, and access is READ, then a
*        temporary NDF with the same bounds as the given main NDF is
*        created, its values are derived from the main NDF's width
*        array.
*     -  If SPECWIDS and SPECVALS are absent, and access is WRITE or
*        UPDATE, then a permanent NDF with the same bounds as the base
*        NDF of which the main NDF is a section is created, its values
*        are derived from the width array of the main's base NDF.
*        Only a section of the new NDF is accessed, its bounds match the
*        main NDF.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the given main NDF.
*     XLOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The HDS locator of the Specdre Extension. This should be an
*        extension of the main NDF. If the Specdre Extension does not
*        exist, then this argument must be given as DAT__NOLOC.
*     ACCESS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The access mode required. This can be 'READ', 'WRITE', or
*        'UPDATE'.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The numeric type for mapping the width array. This can be
*        '_REAL', '_DOUBLE', or blank. If given blank and if the array
*        is stored '_DOUBLE', then it is mapped in double precision. If
*        given blank and if the array is not stored '_DOUBLE', then it
*        is mapped '_REAL'. In effect, usually a blank type
*        specification causes the array to be mapped with the stored
*        type. On return, TYPE is '_REAL' or '_DOUBLE' and tells the
*        type actually used for mapping.
*     PNTR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The pointer to which the width array is mapped.
*     ONDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The identifier of the SPECWIDS NDF, which is a component of the
*        Specdre Extension.
*     NELM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of elements in the mapped array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status. This is set if the type specification is
*        invalid.

*  Notes:
*     This routine recognises the Specdre Extension v. 0.7.
