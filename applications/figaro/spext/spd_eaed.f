      SUBROUTINE SPD_EAED( NDF, XLOC, ACCESS, TYPE, LABEL, UNITS,
     :   PNTR, ONDF, NELM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_EAED

*  Purpose:
*     Access centres in SPECVALS structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_EAED( NDF, XLOC, ACCESS, TYPE, LABEL, UNITS,
*        PNTR, ONDF, NELM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine will access an array of spectroscopic centre values
*     from the SPECVALS structure in the Specdre Extension. Should this
*     not exist, it will be created from the spectroscopic axis in the
*     main NDF's AXIS structure.
*
*     If the SPECVALS structure already exists, then this routine will
*     access a section with the same bounds as the main NDF. The action
*     of this routine in the absence of the SPECVALS structure depends
*     on the access mode:
*     -  If read access is requested, then a temporary NDF is created.
*        It has the same bounds as the main NDF and is filled with
*        default values derived from the main NDF's AXIS structure.
*     -  If write or update access is requested, then a permanent NDF is
*        created. This will be located in the Specdre Extension of that
*        NDF that is the base of the main NDF. (The main NDF might be a
*        section only.) The Extension NDF will also have the same shape
*        as the main's base and will be filled with default values from
*        the main's base's AXIS structure. From this new permanent
*        Extension NDF a section with the same bounds as the main NDF is
*        accessed and returned to the calling routine.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the given main NDF.
*     XLOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The HDS locator of the Specdre Extension. This should be an
*        extension of the main NDF. If the Specdre Extension does not
*        exist, then this argument must be given as DAT__NOLOC.
*     ACCESS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The access mode required. This can be 'READ', 'WRITE', or
*        'UPDATE'.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The numeric type for mapping the centre array. This can be
*        '_REAL', '_DOUBLE', or blank. If given blank and if the array
*        is stored '_DOUBLE', then it is mapped in double precision. If
*        given blank and if the array is not stored '_DOUBLE', then it
*        is mapped '_REAL'. In effect, usually a blank type
*        specification causes the array to be mapped with the stored
*        type. On return, TYPE is '_REAL' or '_DOUBLE' and tells the
*        type actually used for mapping.
*     LABEL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The Extension NDF's data component label.
*        If access is read, this argument is a returned argument.
*        If access is write, this argument is a given argument.
*        If access is update and this argument is given blank, this
*        argument is a returned argument. Otherwise this is a given
*        argument.
*     UNITS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The Extension NDF's data component unit.
*        If access is read, this argument is a returned argument.
*        If access is write, this argument is a given argument.
*        If access is update and this argument is given blank, this
*        argument is a returned argument. Otherwise this is a given
*        argument.
*     PNTR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The pointer to which the centre array is mapped.
*     ONDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The identifier of the SPECVALS NDF, which is a component of the
*        Specdre Extension.
*     NELM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of elements in the mapped array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status. This is set if the type specification is
*        invalid.

*  Notes:
*     This routine recognises the Specdre Extension v. 0.7.
