      SUBROUTINE DSA_WRUSER( STRING )
*+
*  Name:
*     DSA_WRUSER
*     DSA_WRFLUSH

*  Purpose:
*     Put out a message string to the user.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DSA_WRUSER( STRING )
*     CALL DSA_WRFLUSH( )

*  Description:
*     DSA_WRUSER puts out a message string to the user, buffering it
*     until either a line's worth of output has been received or until a
*     string containing a newline code (`backslash n', as in C's printf)
*     is received. So a call to this routine does not necessarily result
*     in a single line being output immediately to the user.
*
*     A call to DSA_WRFLUSH puts out any buffered messages that have
*     been written using DSA_WRUSER but not yet sent to the user, and is
*     exactly the same as making a call to DSA_WRUSER with a string
*     consisting solely of a 'backslash n' sequence. Using this routine
*     allows a program to avoid the need for backslash characters in its
*     code - something that some UNIX compilers treat as escape
*     characters in a true emulation of C.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The (part of the) message.

*  Implementation Status:
*     This code is taken straight from DSA 5.0-1 with only cosmetic
*     changes, the replacement of calls to PAR_WRUSER, the conversion of
*     common variables into 'save' local variables, and the
*     initialisation of such variables. There is
*     troublesome code where buffer remains are copied to is beginning,
*     copying overlapping substrings within the same string is not
*     standard Fortran.

*  History:
*     10 Jun 1987 (ks):
*        Original version.  KS / AAO.
*     21 Aug 1992 (ks):
*        Automatic portability modifications ("INCLUDE" syntax etc)
*        made.
*     23 Aug 1992 (ks):
*        Modified to remove the backslash character from the code for
*        portablility reasons. Also introduction of DSA_WRFLUSH.
*     29 Aug 1992 (ks):
*        "INCLUDE" filenames now upper case.
*     15 Feb 1996 (hme):
*        FDA library. The common variables are made local, save,
*        variables.
