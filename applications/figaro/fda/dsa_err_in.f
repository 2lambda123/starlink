      SUBROUTINE DSA_ERROR_INFORMATION( DSAREF,
     :   ERRORS, VARIANCE, NONE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DSA_ERROR_INFORMATION

*  Purpose:
*     Determine what form of error information is available.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DSA_ERROR_INFORMATION( DSAREF,
*        ERRORS, VARIANCE, NONE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns three logical variables that indicate if
*     error information for a structure is held as a) an error array,
*     giving the uncertainties in the data for each point, b) a variance
*     array, giving the variance in the data for each point, or c) not
*     held at all. Since the error array is not an option in the current
*     implementation, this boils down to looking for variance and
*     setting the returned VARIANCE and NONE accordingly.

*  Arguments:
*     DSAREF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The reference name associated with the NDF.
*     ERRORS = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Always false.
*     VARIANCE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether variance exists.
*     NONE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        This is always the opposite of VARIANCE.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
