      SUBROUTINE DSA_MAP_QUALITY( DSAREF, MODE, TYPE,
     :   ADDRESS, MSLOT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DSA_MAP_QUALITY

*  Purpose:
*     Map the quality array in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DSA_MAP_QUALITY( DSAREF, MODE, TYPE, ADDRESS, MSLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine maps the quality array in an NDF. If there is in fact
*     no quality array, then one will be created and filled with zeros,
*     hence flagging all pixels as good.
*
*     If the main data array contains flagged values, and the
*     application has not indicated through a call to
*     DSA_USE_FLAGGED_VALUES that it wants to handle these directly,
*     then any flagged values in the data array will be removed and the
*     corresponding elements of the quality array will be set.
*
*     The compulsory calling sequence for applications that use quality
*     is (other processing can be interspersed):
*
*        DSA_USE_QUALITY()
*        DSA_MAP_DATA()
*        DSA_MAP_QUALITY()
*
*     Access to both arrays is achieved by the DSA system when the data
*     are mapped. Therefore the intent to use quality must be declared
*     beforehand. Since the quality incorporates bad-value information
*     from the data and since this is definitive only after the data
*     have been accessed with a certain data type, the application
*     cannot map quality before the data have been accessed.
*
*     Contrary to previous implementations, the map type must be 'BYTE'
*     and the actual map type in NDF speak is '_UBYTE'.

*  Arguments:
*     DSAREF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The reference name associated with the NDF.
*     MODE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The access mode, 'READ', 'WRITE', or 'UPDATE'.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The data type to be used to map the array. If this is not
*        'BYTE' an error results.
*     ADDRESS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The memory address of the mapped array.
*     MSLOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The map slot, a handle that can be used to unmap this array
*        later.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     22 Jul 1988 (ks):
*        Original version.
*     08 Sep 1989 (ks):
*        Call to DSA_MAP_ARRAY now sets propagation flag false.
*     11 Dec 1989 (ks):
*        Now sets QUAL_UPDATE flag on a write or update mapping.
*     21 Feb 1990 (ks):
*        Uses DSA__QUAL_NAME to remove assumptions about
*        file format details.
*     22 Apr 1991 (ks):
*        Now uses DSA__CREATE_QUAL_ENV to create the 
*        environment for the quality array - allows support
*        of structured arrays including BADBITS values.
*     01 May 1991 (ks):
*        Now gets BADBITS value and tests to see if this
*        is likely to cause problems.
*     21 Aug 1992 (ks):
*        Automatic portability modifications
*        ("INCLUDE" syntax etc) made.
*     23 Aug 1992 (ks):
*        Remove unused variable declarations.
*     29 Aug 1992 (ks):
*        "INCLUDE" filenames now upper case.
*     16 Jun 1993 (ks):
*        Now sets 'quality exist' flag if array created.
*     26 Oct 1994 (ks):
*        Now uses new calling sequence for DSA_MAP_ARRAY.
*     03 Feb 1995 (ks):
*        Now supports files with both flagged data values and
*        quality arrays.
*     07 Feb 1995 (ks):
*        DSA_MAP_QUALITY now renamed to DSA_ACT_MAP_QUALITY
*        and this new DSA_MAP_QUALITY becomes merely a
*        wrap-up for that routine.
*     26 Nov 1995 (hme):
*        FDA library.
*     18 Dec 1995 (hme):
*        Review use of common variables. Now data and quality are always
*        mapped on the same slot.
*     18 Jan 1996 (hme):
*        When looking for the map slot, do not insist on 'DATA,QUALITY',
*        since some map slots have only 'DATA' as the component to be
*        unmapped. This is the case when the quality is in a buffer, but
*        the data are not.
*     12 Feb 1996 (hme):
*        For UW access mark reference as quality-modified.
*     19 Feb 1996 (hme):
*        Translate between application-side status and Starlink status.
