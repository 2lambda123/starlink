      SUBROUTINE DSA_MAP_DATA( DSAREF, MODE, TYPE,
     :   ADDRESS, MSLOT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DSA_MAP_DATA

*  Purpose:
*     Map the main data array in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DSA_MAP_DATA( DSAREF, MODE, TYPE, ADDRESS, MSLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine maps the main data array in an NDF. If the quality
*     array is to be mapped as well, then DSA_USE_QUALITY must be called
*     before this routine and DSA_MAP_QUALITY must be called after this
*     routine.
*
*     If neither DSA_USE_QUALITY nor DSA_USE_FLAGGED_VALUES have been
*     called before this routine, then the returned data array is
*     guaranteed to be free of bad values. This however means that any
*     bad values in the actual data have been filled in with fake values
*     that only appear to be good.

*  Arguments:
*     DSAREF = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The reference name associated with the NDF.
*     MODE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The access mode, 'READ', 'WRITE', or 'UPDATE'.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The data type to be used to map the array. E.g. 'FLOAT' or
*        'DOUBLE'.
*     ADDRESS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The memory address of the mapped array.
*     MSLOT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The map slot, a handle that can be used to unmap this array
*        later.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     24 Jun 1987 (ks):
*        Original version.
*     22 Jul 1988 (ks):
*        Data quality/flagged value handling added.  Call
*        to DSA_MAP_ARRAY modified.
*     08 Sep 1989 (ks):
*        Control of flagged value propagation added.  Call
*        to DSA_MAP_ARRAY modified.
*     13 Dec 1989 (ks):
*        Now sets `data flagged' flag in structure if
*        appropriate.  Also now uses DSA__ routines to
*        handle the details of structure contents.
*     03 May 1990 (ks):
*        Now clears the `data flagged' flag in the structure
*        if it was set but no elements were actually flagged.
*     21 Aug 1992 (ks):
*        Automatic portability modifications
*        ("INCLUDE" syntax etc) made.
*     23 Aug 1992 (ks):
*        Remove unused variable declarations.
*     29 Aug 1992 (ks):
*        "INCLUDE" filenames now upper case.
*     08 Oct 1992 (hme):
*        Unflag the data only if the
*        mode is not WRITE. Prologue now states correctly
*        that USE_FLAGS and USE_QUALITY are LOGICAL.
*     26th Oct 1994 (ks):
*        Now uses new calling sequence for DSA_MAP_ARRAY. 
*      3rd Feb 1995 (ks):
*        Now supports files that have both flagged data and
*        quality arrays.
*     25 Nov 1995 (hme):
*        FDA library.
*     12 Feb 1996 (hme):
*        For UW access mark reference as data-modified. If caller is
*        ignorant of any kind of quality information, also mark quality
*        as modified, since it will be handled internally.
*     19 Feb 1996 (hme):
*        Translate between application-side status and Starlink status.
