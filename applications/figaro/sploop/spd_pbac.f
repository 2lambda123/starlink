      SUBROUTINE SPD_PBAC( XKEY, YKEY, T_CKEY, MODX, MODX2,
     :   MODF, MODF2, NPAR, MODPAR, MSKDIM, MSKUSE, MASK, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_PBAC

*  Purpose:
*     PGCURS with pan and zoom through spectrum and model.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_PBAC( XKEY, YKEY, CKEY, MODX, MODX2,
*        MODF, MODF2, NPAR, MODPAR, MSKDIM, MSKUSE, MASK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine is a wrap around PGCURS. It will return a position
*     and the character pressed, just like PGCURS. However, this routine
*     also knows about the spectrum and model and how they are currently
*     displayed. The spectrum and model should be displayed before this
*     routine is called. At least this routine assumes it is displayed
*     and its viewport is active.
*
*     Certain key strokes will be intercepted and handled by this routine.
*     These key strokes are not returned to the calling routine, they are:
*
*     W: Reset display to show the whole finder image with original
*        contrast.
*     X: Zoom twofold in x direction with the indicated x position as
*        the new centre.
*     Y: Zoom twofold in y direction with the indicated y position as
*        the new centre.
*     Z: Zoom twofold in x and y direction with the indicated position
*        as the new centre.
*     P: Pan around the image, i.e. move by 3/4 of the current display
*        range. Movement can be in x, in y, or both. A left/right
*        movement occurs if and only if the key is hit in the left/right
*        quarter of the x range. Similarly for y movement. Diagonal
*        movement occurs if the key is hit in an intersection area for x
*        and y movement, i.e. close to the corners of the viewport.
*
*     These keys are intercepted regardless of their case.
*
*     PGCURS seems to treat the first mouse button as a space bar and
*     the second mouse button as a return key. The third mouse button
*     produces an error message and reversion to the given coordinates.
*     Control keys are not detected at all, neither are function keys or
*     keypad keys.

*  Arguments:
*     XKEY = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The x coordinate of the last key stroke.
*     YKEY = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        The y coordinate of the last key stroke.
*     CKEY = CHARACTER * ( 1 ) (Returned)
*        The character of the last key stroke.
*     MODX = LOGICAL (Given)
*        True if MODF given.
*     MODX2 = LOGICAL (Given)
*        True if MODF2 given.
*     MODF = EXTERNAL (Given)
*        Routine to evaluate model for a given x value array.
*        SUBROUTINE MODF( NX, X, NPAR, MODPAR, Y, STATUS )
*           NX = INTEGER (Given)
*           X( NX ) = REAL (Given)
*           NPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*           MODPAR( NPAR ) = REAL (Given)
*           Y( NX ) = REAL (Returned)
*           STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        This routine is used for the principal model, most obviously
*        the dashed line in the bottom view port.
*     MODF2 = EXTERNAL (Given)
*        Routine to evaluate model for a given x value array.
*        SUBROUTINE MODF2( NX, X, NPAR, MODPAR, Y, STATUS )
*           NX = INTEGER (Given)
*           X( NX ) = REAL (Given)
*           NPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*           MODPAR( NPAR ) = REAL (Given)
*           Y( NX ) = REAL (Returned)
*           STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        This routine is used for the secondary model, i.e. the
*        full-drawn line in the top viewport.
*     NPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The size of the MODPAR array, passed on to MODF, MODF2.
*     MODPAR( NPAR ) = REAL (Given)
*        The model parameters, passed on to MODF, MODF2. Note that both
*        routines have to use the same set of parameters.
*     MSKDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Size of MASK array. Must be even.
*     MSKUSE = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of valid mask intervals. Give zero to indicate that no
*        mask array is available.
*     MASK( MSKDIM ) = REAL (Given)
*        The mask is used to draw a number of pedestals at the bottom of
*        the bottom viewport. The pedestals extend
*           from MASK(1) to MASK(1+MSKDIM/2),
*           from MASK(2) to MASK(2+MSKDIM/2),
*              ...
*           from MASK(MSKUSE) to MASK(MSKUSE+MSKDIM/2),
*        provided that the leading end is actually to the left of the
*        trailing end. Pedestals may overlap.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
