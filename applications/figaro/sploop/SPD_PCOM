*  Name:
*     SPD_PCOM

*  Purpose:
*     Common block include file, internal to SPLOOP library.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     INCLUDE SPD_PCOM

*  Description:
*     This file declares the common block used by the SPLOOP library to
*     store information on the interactive display, i.e. the finder
*     image, the spectrum and model, the PGPLOT viewports and zoom
*     transformations.
*
*     This file should be used only internally by the SPLOOP library,
*     other routines are not supposed to access the common block
*     directly.

*  Variables:
*     DEVOPN = LOGICAL
*        True if PGPLOT has been successfully opened on a valid device.
*     IMXST = LOGICAL
*        True if a finder image has been registered.
*     IMAGE = INTEGER
*        The pointer to the finder image. The finder image is a
*        two-dimensional REAL array of size IMDIM(1) by IMDIM(2).
*     IMDIM( 2 ) = INTEGER
*        First and second dimension of the image.
*     IMWIN( 4 ) = REAL
*        The world coordinates to be mapped to the viewport edges for
*        the finder image. The four elements are for left, right,
*        bottom, and top edge, resp. Pan and zoom actions will affect
*        these numbers.
*     IMZOOM( 6 ) = REAL
*        The matrix to scale and shift array indices into world
*        coordinates for the finder image. Usually world coordinates are
*        NDF pixel indices, so that
*           IMZOOM = { LBND1-1., 1., 0., LBND2-1., 0., 1. }
*     IMRNG( 2 ) = REAL
*        The image value that is to be displayed in background and
*        foreground colour respectively. Re-scaling the display will
*        affect these numbers.
*     SPXST = LOGICAL
*        True if a spectrum has been registered.
*     VARXST = LOGICAL
*        True if the spectrum has a variance array.
*     NDATA = INTEGER
*        The size of the arrays that XDAT, YBIN, YVAR, YCRS, YER{LU}
*        point to.
*     XDAT = INTEGER
*        The pointer to the x array, which is REAL and has length NDATA.
*     YBIN = INTEGER
*        The pointer to a REAL array of NDATA y values. YBIN(XDAT) is
*        plotted in the bottom viewport with bin style, ignoring bad
*        values.
*     YVAR = INTEGER
*        The pointer to a REAL array of NDATA variance values.
*        YVAR(XDAT) is used to plot error bars in the upper viewport.
*     YCRS = INTEGER
*        The pointer to a REAL work space for NDATA values. YCRS(XDAT)
*        is calculated prior to display by subtracting the model from
*        YBIN. It is plotted in the top viewport as crosses, ignoring
*        bad values.
*     YER{LU} = INTEGER
*        The pointers to two REAL work spaces of NDATA values.
*        YER{LU}(XDAT) are calculated prior to display as YCRS -+
*        SQRT(YVAR). They are plotted in the top viewport as y error
*        bars, ignoring bad values. These work spaces are needed only if
*        a variance is registered.
*     SPWIN( 6 ) = REAL
*        The world coordinates to be mapped to the viewport edges for
*        the spectrum and model. The six elements are for left, right,
*        bottom for lower viewport, top for lower viewport, bottom for
*        upper viewport, and top for upper viewport, resp. Pan and zoom
*        actions will affect these numbers.
*
*        Upon registration of a spectrum the x range is set to the
*        extrema of the XDAT array at time of registration. The bottom y
*        range is set to the extrema of the YBIN array at time of
*        registration, plus 5 per cent at the top and bottom. The top y
*        range is calculated prior to display according to what needs to
*        be plotted in that viewport and what the actual numbers over
*        the whole x range are.
*     SPRNG( 4 ) = REAL
*        A backup of the original first four elements of SPWIN. This is
*        used to unzoom the display to the original x and y ranges. The
*        y range of the top viewport does not change, so no need to keep
*        a backup.

*  History:
*     27 Apr 1994 (hme):
*        Original version.
*     06 May 1994 (hme):
*        Changed the spectrum and model part. It is now up to the SPLOOP
*        display routine to work out the model, data-model etc. from
*        model parameters and a given model function EXTERNAL.
