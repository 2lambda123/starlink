      SUBROUTINE SPD_PDAA( IMPTR, DIM1, DIM2, LBND1, LBND2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_PDAA

*  Purpose:
*     Register finder image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_PDAA( IMPTR, DIM1, DIM2, LBND1, LBND2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine registers the given array, its bounds etc. as the
*     finder image. This includes intialisation of the controls for the
*     interactive PGPLOT graphics. A finder image is an image to be used
*     in interactive display.
*
*     This routine only registers the array, it does not allocate the
*     array. The array must have been mapped by the calling routine.
*
*     The finder image should not contain bad values, as these cause
*     extremely low contrast, they may also cause a floating point
*     exception when contrast is enhanced to cover an image value range
*     smaller than 1.
*
*     It is recommended that bad values be given a value somewhat lower
*     than the minimum value. This ensures they are always displayed
*     at least as dark as the minimum value.

*  Arguments:
*     IMPTR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The pointer to the array that is the finder image. The array
*        pointed to must be of type REAL and with dimensions DIM1 and
*        DIM2.
*     DIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the finder image.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the finder image.
*     LBND1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower NDF bound along the first image axis. If in doubt,
*        give 1.
*     LBND2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower NDF bound along the second image axis. If in doubt,
*        give 1.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
