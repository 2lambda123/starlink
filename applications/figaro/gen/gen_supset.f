C
C     Given two two-dimensional arrays that overlap (in a nice simple
C     way, with one element in one mapping directly onto one element 
C     in the other), copies the data from the overlapping portion of
C     the input array into the corresponding elements of the output
C     array.  All other elements of the output array are set to zero.
C
C     Parameters -   (">" input, "<" output)
C
C     (>) IN      (Real array IN (NX,NY)) Input array
C     (>) NX      (Integer) First dimension of IN
C     (>) NY      (Integer) Second dimension of IN
C     (>) NXOUT   (Integer) First dimension of OUT
C     (>) NYOUT   (Integer) Second dimension of OUT
C     (>) IXST    (Integer) X (first dimension) element number in OUT
C                 on which element (1,1) of IN is mapped.  
C     (>) IYST    (integer) Y (second dimension) element number in
C                 OUT on which element (1,1) of IN is mapped.  If the
C                 overlap is such that the first element of IN does
C                 not map to any element of OUT, the values of IXST
C                 and IYST can be set to 0 or -ve values.
C     (<) OUT     (Real array OUT(NXOUT,NYOUT)) Output array.

C     If any of the lower Y values in OUT don't map onto
C     the input array, set those lines to zero in one go.
C     Also start to calculate the limit variables.  Note
C     IY1 and IY2 are respectively first and last Y element
C     numbers in OUT to which data is copied from IN.  IYIN
C     is the line in IN corresponding to line IY1 in OUT.

C     Calculate similar variables for X.  Also, LBYTES, CBYTES
C     and RBYTES are the number of bytes in each row of OUT to be
C     set to zero, copied from IN, and set to zero.
