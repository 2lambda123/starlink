      SUBROUTINE GEN_FORTERR( IOS, SYMB, ERROR )
*+
*  Name:
*     GEN_FORTERR

*  Purpose:
*     Given a Fortran error code, returns an error string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GEN_FORTERR( IOS, SYMB, ERROR )

*  Description:
*     GEN_FORTERR returns a character string saying that a Fortran error
*     has occured. The codes given to this routine are those returned,
*     for example, by an I/O statement containing an IOSTAT=variable
*     specification.
*
*     Since the error codes depend on the machine and the Fortran
*     implementation, this routine returns an unspecific error string.
*     It is really a dummy routine and exists only for backwards
*     compatibility.

*  Arguments:
*     IOS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The Fortran error code.
*     SYMB = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Ignored.
*     ERROR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The character string describing the error.  The maximum length
*        of message returned by this routine is 62 characters.
