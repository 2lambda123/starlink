      SUBROUTINE SPD_UGAB( PARAM, PARCAN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SPD_UGAB

*  Purpose:
*     Dissociate a device from AGI and PGPLOT in an SGS zone.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SPD_UGAB( PARAM, PARCAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine quadruplet SPD_UGA{ABCD} is used by
*     Specdre instead of AGP_ASSOC, AGP_DEASS, PGPAGE, AGP_SVIEW to
*     overcome the problem that normally the view surface is the base
*     picture and PGPAGE will clear more than the AGI picture to be
*     used.
*
*     This routine closes PGPLOT and disassociates SGS and AGI.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter for associated with the device.
*        This is passed to AGS_DEASS.
*     PARCAN = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true the parameter given by PARAM is cancelled, otherwise it
*        is annulled. This is passed to AGS_DEASS.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status. This routine is executed regardless of the
*        given status.
