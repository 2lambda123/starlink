C     Defines the numeric common variables for the FIT_ routines.
C
C     FBUFF      Is the main I/O buffer, (2880 bytes) defined as a
C                byte array.  Holds one FITS `logical' record.
C     FBUFFS     Is the same as FBUFF, but is defined as a word array.
C     FBUFFI     Is the same as FBUFF, but defined as a longword array.
C     FPTR       Points to the next availabale byte in FBUFF.
C     TBUFF      Is the large buffer in which logical blocks (built up
C                in FBUFF) are blocked up into actual tape records.
C     TBLOCK     Is the current blocking factor - number of logical records 
C                in each actual tape record.
C     MAXTBL     Is the maximum allowed value for TBLOCK (fixed parameter).
C     BCOUNT     Is the number of logical records already held in TBUFF.
C     MTUNIT     Is the I/O channel for the tape drive in use.
C     MTSTAT     Is the last TIO_ package error code.
C     LUFILE     Is the logical unit number for a disk file, if used.
C     NOTERM     Flag used to suppress writing of a proper logical end of
C                tape record - used by FIT_NOTERM.
C     NOSWAP     Flag used to suppress byte swapping
C     TDENS      Is the tape density (800,1600 or 6250, or 0 if unknown)
C     RINDEX     Is the record index used when direct access files are
C                being used (as happens under UNIX). If zero, direct I/O is
C                not being used.

C     Modified:
C
C     22nd Oct 1987.  Now uses TIO_ instead of MTPCKG.  Common is 
C                     unchanged, except for the descriptions of MTUNIT
C                     and MTERR.
C     30th Jan 1990.  TBUFF, TBLOCK and BCOUNT added to support the
C                     new large block FITS conventions.  KS/AAO.
C     28th Jun 1990.  TDENS added.  KS/AAO.
C      5th Mar 1993.  NOTERM added. KS/AAO.
C     28th Apr 1993.  RINDEX added. KS/AAO.
C     26th Jul 1994.  Make common blocks SAVE. HME / UoE, Starlink.
