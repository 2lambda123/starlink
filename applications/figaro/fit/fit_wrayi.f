      SUBROUTINE FIT_WRAYI (DATA,NELM,STATUS)
C
C     F I T _ W R A Y I
C
C     Writes an integer array to tape as part of a FITS image.
C
C     This routine simply copies the array element by element into a
C     buffer, writing the buffer to tape whenever it fills.  This means
C     that this routine may be called as many times as necessary - for
C     example, if all the data is not available in memory at one time.
C     This routine should be called for the first time immediately
C     following the FIT_WEND call that terminated the FITS header.  Once
C     all the data is output, FIT_CLOSE should be called to flush out
C     the data buffer.
C
C     Parameters -   (">" input, "W" workspace, "!" modified, "<" output)
C
C     (>) DATA     (Integer array DATA(NELM)) The data array to be output.
C                  DATA may be multi-dimensional, but it is treated
C                  as linear here for generality.
C     (>) NELM     (Integer) The number of elements in DATA.
C     (<) STATUS   (Integer) Returned status code.  0 => OK, non-zero
C                  values indicate a tape I/O error and can be
C                  decoded using FIT_ERROR.
C
C     Common variables used -
C
C     (W) FBUFF    (Byte array) The main FITS I/O buffer
C     (W) FBUFFI   (Integer array) The same buffer as FBUFF.
C     (!) FPTR     (Integer) Byte level pointer to FBUFF.
C     (>) NOSWAP   (Logical) Used to suppress byte swapping
C
C                   All defined in the file COMF.INC
C
C     Subroutines / functions used -
C
C     GEN_WBSWAP   (GEN_ package) Swap order of bytes in longwords
C     FIT_MWRIT    (FIT_    "   ) Write FBUFF buffer to tape

C
      INTEGER FPTRI,FPTRO,I
C
C     Write out as signed 32 bit integers.  The call to GEN_WBSWAP
C     is needed because the VAX byte order is not that required
C     by the FITS standard.
