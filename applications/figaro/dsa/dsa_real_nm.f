C  Routine:
C     DSA_REAL_NAME
C
C  Function:
C     Returns the real file name corresponding to a temporary file.
C
C  Description:
C     On systems without version numbers for files, a new file is sometimes
C     requested with the same name as an existing file. If this existing file
C     is already opened by DSA a new file of the same name cannot be created
C     without confusing the system. In this case the system (the code is in
C     DSA_FNAME) creates a temporary file with a name that it stores in the
C     common blocks maintained by the DSA system.  This routine can be called
C     to determine the real file name corresponding to such a temporary file
C     name.
C
C  Language:
C     Fortran
C
C  Call:
C     CALL DSA_REAL_NAME (FILE_NAME,REAL_NAME)
C
C  Parameters:
C     (>) FILE_NAME   (Character string) The name of the file in question - ie
C                     the name of an actual file.
C     (<) REAL_NAME   (Character string) The name by which the file will be
C                     known after it is closed down. If a temporary name is
C                     being used, this will be the name to which the file will
C                     eventually be renamed. Otherwise this will be the same
C                     as FILE_NAME. If FILE_NAME is not known to the DSA system
C                     at all, REAL_NAME is returned set equaal to FILE_NAME.
C
C  Prior requirements:
C     The DSA system should have been initialised.
