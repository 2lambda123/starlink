C  Routine name:
C     DSA_WRFLUSH
C
C  Function:
C     Flushes any message string to the user.
C
C  Description:
C     DSA_WRUSER outputs a message string to the user, buffering it until
C     either a line's worth of output has been received or until a string
C     containing a newline code (`backslash n', as in C's printf) is 
C     received.  A call to DSA_WRFLUSH outputs any buffered messages that
C     have been written using DSA_WRUSER but not yet sent to the user, and is
C     exactly the same as making a call to DSA_WRUSER with a string consisting
C     solely of a 'backslash n' sequence. Output is through the Figaro 
C     parameter system (the routine PAR_WRUSER). Using this routine allows a 
C     program to avoid the need for backslash characters in its code - 
C     something that some UNIX compilers treat as escape characters.

C
      CHARACTER BACKSLASH*1            ! Holds the backslash character
C
C     Using CHAR to set the backslash character avoids the need to have
C     an explicit backslash in the code - which some UNIX compilers will
C     appreciate - but does introduce the assumption that ASCII is being
C     used for characters.
