C  Routine name:
C     DSA_DELETE_QUALITY
C
C  Function:
C     Deletes a quality information structure.
C
C  Description:
C     This routine completely removes the quality information structure
C     (which may be a simple array or a structure, depending on the data
C     data format) from a specified data structure. If the structure 
C     does not contain a quality information structure, then this 
C     routine does nothing. The quality array should not be mapped
C     when this routine is called, and nor should the main data array.
C     Note that this routine does no processing of the data - it merely
C     deletes the structure.
C
C  Language:
C     FORTRAN
C
C  Call:
C     CALL DSA_DELETE_QUALITY (REF_NAME,STATUS)
C
C  Parameters:   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C
C     (>) REF_NAME     (Fixed string,descr) The reference name associated
C                      with the structure. 
C     (!) STATUS       (Integer,ref) Status return code.  If a bad status
C                      value is passed to it, this routine returns
C                      immediately.
C
C  External variables used:
C     Only common variables internal to the DSA system.
C
C  External subroutines / functions used:
C     ICH_FOLD, DSA_FIND_REF, DSA_CHECK_MAPPING,
C     DSA__DELETE_QUALITY, DSA_WRUSER,
C
C  Prior requirements:
C     DSA_OPEN must have been called to initialise the system, and the data
C     structure in question should have been opened, eg by DSA_INPUT.

C
C  Common variable details:

C                      Indicates unknown (0), known not to exist (-1),
