C  Routine name:
C     DSA_POST_PROCESS_FLAGGED_VALUES
C
C  Function:
C     Performs any necessary post-processing for flagged data values.
C
C  Description:
C     This routine must be called by any routine that has used flagged
C     data values to process data.  It reverses any operations
C     on data arrays that DSA_PRE_PROCESS_FLAGGED_VALUES may have 
C     performed by in order to handle data structures where the quality
C     information is in fact held in data quality arrays.  It should be 
C     called once all processing on the data array is complete.
C
C  Language:
C     FORTRAN
C
C  Call:
C     CALL DSA_POST_PROCESS_FLAGGED_VALUES (REF_NAME,STATUS)
C
C  Parameters:   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C
C     (>) REF_NAME       (Fixed string,descr) The reference name for the
C                        structure being processed.
C     (!) STATUS         (Integer,ref) Status code.  If bad status is
C                        passed to it, this routine returns immediately.
C
C  External variables used:
C     Only common variables internal to the DSA package.
C
C  External subroutines / functions used:
C     DYN_ELEMENT, ICH_FOLD, ICH_LEN, DSA_FIND_REF, DSA_GET_ACTUAL_NAME,
C     DSA_WRUSER, DSA_UNFLAG_DATA
C
C  Prior requirements:
C     DSA_OPEN must have been called to initialise the system, and the
C     structure must have been opened using DSA_INPUT, DSA_OUTPUT or
C     an equivalent routine.  The data array must have been mapped.  
C     DSA_PRE_PROCESS_FLAGGED_VALUES must have been called.

C
C     Now, see if we need to do anything.  The only condition we have
C     to look for is the case where there was a data quality array, 
C     which the program was not handling for itself, in which case we have
C     to set the quality array to reflect any possible changes.  Note that
C     by this stage all the common table items such as QUAL_EXIST will have
C     been set.  
C
      IF ((QUAL_EXIST(REF_SLOT).GT.0).AND.
     :                 (.NOT.USE_QUALITY(REF_SLOT))) THEN
C
C        We don't need to bother updateing the quality if the data array was 
C        mapped readonly, because it will not be updated when it is
C        unmapped.
C
         IF (MAP_CALL_MODE(DATA_SLOT(REF_SLOT)).NE.'R') THEN
C
C           We have to process the flags.  First we have to hunt around the 
C           common tables to actually find the mapped arrays.
C
            WORK_SLOT=MAP_CALL_WORK(DATA_SLOT(REF_SLOT))
            IF (WORK_SLOT.EQ.0) THEN
C
C              Data was mapped directly to its base array.
C
               MAP_SLOT=MAP_CALL_SLOT(DATA_SLOT(REF_SLOT))
               DATA_ADDR=MAP_POINTER(MAP_SLOT)
               DATA_TYPE=MAP_TYPE(MAP_SLOT)
            ELSE
C
C              Data is in a work array
C
               DATA_ADDR=WORK_POINTER(WORK_SLOT)
               DATA_TYPE=WORK_TYPE(WORK_SLOT)
            END IF
C
C           We also have to find the quality array, which will have been
C           mapped by DSA_PRE_PROCESS_FLAGGED_VALUES.  We know it will 
C           have been mapped as 'BYTE', so we don't need the type.
C
            WORK_SLOT=MAP_CALL_WORK(QUALITY_SLOT(REF_SLOT))
            IF (WORK_SLOT.EQ.0) THEN
               MAP_SLOT=MAP_CALL_SLOT(QUALITY_SLOT(REF_SLOT))
               QUAL_ADDR=MAP_POINTER(MAP_SLOT)
            ELSE
               QUAL_ADDR=WORK_POINTER(WORK_SLOT)
            END IF
C 
C           Get the number of elements in the data
C
            NELM=1
            DO I=1,DATA_NDIM(REF_SLOT)
               NELM=NELM*DATA_DIMS(I,REF_SLOT)
            END DO
C
C           We are here because the program has handled the data using flags,
C           so it will probably have left elements of the data array flagged.
C           If the array was originally flagged then we will only have ended
C           up here if there was originally a quality array as well in the
C           file. We could just unflag the data and set the quality array
C           elements, but it seems better to leave them flagged but to 
C           make sure the quality array reflects them. So we need to clear the
C           quality array before calling DSA_UNFLAG_DATA. If we are leaving
C           flags in the data, we should make sure we have the array flagged
C           as containing flagged data.
C
            QPTR=DYN_ELEMENT(QUAL_ADDR)
            DPTR=DYN_ELEMENT(DATA_ADDR)
            LEAVE_FLAGGED=.TRUE.
            CALL DSA_ZFILL_ARRAY (NELM,QUAL_ADDR,'BYTE',STATUS)
            CALL DSA_UNFLAG_DATA(NELM,LEAVE_FLAGGED,DATA_TYPE,
     :                        DYNAMIC_MEM(DPTR),DYNAMIC_MEM(QPTR),
     :                                             NFLAGGED,STATUS)
            IF (QUAL_EXIST(REF_SLOT).GT.0) QUAL_UPDATE(REF_SLOT)=.TRUE.
         END IF
C
C        Now unmap the quality array
C
         CALL DSA_UNMAP (QUALITY_SLOT(REF_SLOT),STATUS)
C
      END IF
C
C     If the data is to be left flagged - which will be the case unless
C     the mapping was for update only, then we must make sure the array
C     is flagged as one that contains flagged values.
C
      IF (MAP_CALL_MODE(DATA_SLOT(REF_SLOT)).NE.'R') THEN
         IF (DATA_FLAGGED(REF_SLOT).NE.1) THEN
            CALL DSA__SET_FLAGGED (REF_SLOT,.TRUE.,STATUS)
         END IF
      END IF
C
C     Clear the pre-processing flag
C
      PRE_FLAG(REF_SLOT)=.FALSE.
C
C     Exit

  500 CONTINUE
