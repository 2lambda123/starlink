C  Routine name:
C     DSA_CHECK_STRUCTURE
C
C  Function:
C     Tidies up a structure just prior to its closedown.
C
C  Description:
C     This routine should be called just before a structure is shut
C     down.  It checks it for internal consistiency, testing a) the data
C     range structure, invalidating it if necessary, b) the error array,
C     deleting it if it has not been modified but the data has, c) the
C     axis structure, checking it against the data shape if either have
C     changed, deleting any axis structures that are no longer required
C     and checking those that are left for mismatches against the data
C     array, d) any reshaped arrays, deleting any that have been
C     reshaped but not updated. Finally - for an NDF - a check for the
C     adherence of the axis structure to SUN/33 is made. (If .AXIS
C     exists at all, it must have one element per data dimension and
C     each .AXIS(i) must have a DATA_ARRAY. Also each DATA_ARRAY must be
C     one-dimensional with the same dimension as the corresponding data
C     dimension, but this is not checked.)
C
C  Language:
C     FORTRAN
C
C  Call:
C     CALL DSA_CHECK_STRUCTURE (REF_SLOT,STATUS)
C
C  Parameters:   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C
C     (>) REF_SLOT       (Integer,ref) The common table slot used by
C                        the structure to be closed.
C     (!) STATUS         (Integer,ref) Status code.  If bad status is
C                        passed to this routine it returns immediately.
C                        This routine always returns good status if
C                        it runs.

C  External subroutines / functions used:
C     DTA_SZVAR, DTA_DLVAR, DSA_ARRAY_SIZE, DSA_ARRAY_EXIST, 
C     DSA_MAIN_SIZE, DSA_WRUSER, ICH_LEN, GEN_NTH, DSA__INVALIDATE_RANGE,
C     DSA__ERROR_NAME, DSA__DELETE_QUALITY, DSA__AXIS_DATA_NAME,
C     DSA__AXIS_WIDTH_NAME, DSA__DELETE_AXIS, DSA_CHECK_NDF_AXIS
C
C  Prior requirements:
C     This routine is a service routine called as part of structure
C     shutdown.  It uses items in common that may be modified as part
C     of that shutdown, so the point at which it is called is quite
C     important.  It is intended to be called after the structure
C     mapping has been checked, but before any other changes are made.

C  History:
C     4th  Jul 1988  Original version.  KS / AAO.
C     11th Dec 1989  Now deletes reshaped arrays that were not updated.
C                    All knowledge of structure contents moved into
C                    DSA__ routines.  KS/AAO.
C     17th Jan 1990  Calling sequence for DSA__ERROR_NAME changed. KS/AAO.
C     21st Aug 1992  Automatic portability modifications
C                    ("INCLUDE" syntax etc) made. KS/AAO
C     23rd Aug 1992  Remove unused variable declarations. KS/AAO
C     29th Aug 1992  "INCLUDE" filenames now upper case. KS/AAO
C     16th Oct 1992  HME / UoE, Starlink.  Call DSA_ENCDIM instead of
C                    FIG_ENCDIM.
C                    Check the AXIS structure array for the NDF case.
C      7th Feb 1995  KS/AAO. Warns about but no longer deletes quality
C                    arrays when they might have become invalid.
C     28th Nov 1995  Now deletes the quality array in in the case where the
C                    data has been reshaped and the quality array has not
C                    been modified. KS/AAO.
C     11th Dec 1995  Now uses DSA__DELETE_QUALITY to delete the quality array,
C                    to make sure the whole structure is deleted. KS/AAO.

C           Just when we think the axes are OK, with all unecessary ones
C           deleted, we finally check that the axis information adheres
C           to the rules imposed by the NDF library.
C           We try to do this check even when above no need to check
C           axes was seen. This is to repair existing illegal NDFs.
C           There may be problems with file protection or HDS access
C           modes. Such problems would not occur if we move the call to
C           within this IF-block, because access would be write or
C           update.
C           If and only if the NDF axis check is outside this IF block,
C           then the above DSA_MAIN_SIZE should be outside as well.
