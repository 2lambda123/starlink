C  Routine name:
C     DSA_MAP_IMAGINARY
C
C  Function:
C     Maps the imaginary part of the main data array in a structure.
C
C  Description:
C     This routine maps the imaginary part of a complex main data array
C     in a structure, returning the address of the mapped array.  The whole
C     array is mapped.  If there is in fact no such array, then an array
C     of zeros is generated and its address is returned, unless the mapping
C     is for write or update, in which case an array of zeros is created in 
C     the data structure and mapped.  Note that some data formats, in
C     particular Starlink's NDF, have requirements that mean that a new
C     imaginary array cannot be created if the corresponding real array
C     already exists and is mapped.  For this reason, if both real and
C     imaginary arrays are to be mapped, it is worth either mapping the
C     imaginary array first, or ensuring that both arrays are present in
C     the structure before mapping either.
C
C  Language:
C     FORTRAN
C
C  Call:
C     CALL DSA_MAP_IMAGINARY (REF_NAME,MODE,TYPE,ADDRESS,SLOT,STATUS)
C
C  Parameters:   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C
C     (>) REF_NAME     (Fixed string,descr) The reference name associated
C                      with the structure. 
C     (>) MODE         (Fixed string,descr) One of 'READ','WRITE', or
C                      'UPDATE', indicating the way the data is going to
C                      be accessed.  Only the first character is significant.
C     (>) TYPE         (Fixed string,descr) The type of data array to be
C                      mapped onto the structure array.  This can be 'BYTE',
C                      'CHAR','FLOAT','DOUBLE','SHORT','USHORT' or 'INT'.  
C                      If type conversion is needed, it will be performed
C                      automatically.
C     (<) ADDRESS      (Integer,ref) The address of the mapped array.
C     (<) SLOT         (Integer,ref) A handle value associated with this
C                      mapping call, which may be used later to unmap
C                      the data explicitly.
C     (!) STATUS       (Integer,ref) Status return code.  If a bad status
C                      value is passed to it, this routine returns
C                      immediately.

C  History:
C      3rd Feb 1989  Original version.  KS / AAO.
C     24th Feb 1989  Now creates array as DOUBLE, unless mapped
C                    as FLOAT.
C      8th Sep 1989  Call to DSA_MAP_ARRAY now sets propagate flag
C                    false.
C      2nd May 1990  Modified to use DSA__ routines for structure
C                    details rather than just assuming the original
C                    Figaro structure format.  KS/AAO.
C     21st Aug 1992  Automatic portability modifications
C                    ("INCLUDE" syntax etc) made. KS/AAO
C     23rd Aug 1992  Remove unused variable declarations. KS/AAO
C     29th Aug 1992  "INCLUDE" filenames now upper case. KS/AAO
C     26th Oct 1994  Now uses new calling sequence for DSA_MAP_ARRAY. KS/AAO.
C     14th Mar 1996  Appended code of DSA_MAP_COMPLEX. HME / UoE, Starlink.

C        The imaginary array either is required to exist or does exist.
C        Either way, we want to map an actual data object, not a dummy

C
C        If the array did not exist, we need to create one of the same
C        dimensions as the data array.  Just what type to use is unclear -
C        normally, Figaro uses FLOAT arrays for most things, but because
C        complex data is usually there to be fed to NAG, which needs
C        double precision, DOUBLE is probably best in this case.  The
C        compromise used here is to use DOUBLE unless the caller explicitly
C        wanted FLOAT.
