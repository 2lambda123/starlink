C  Routine name:
C     DSA_UNMAP
C
C  Function:
C     Unmaps a previously mapped array
C
C  Description:
C     DSA_UNMAP can be called to explicitly unmap a data array previously
C     mapped by one of the DSA_ mapping routines.  This is usually not
C     necessary, since DSA_CLOSE will reverse the effect of all mappings.
C     Since it is possible for arrays to be multiply mapped, the effect of
C     this routine is not necessarily to completely close down a mapped
C     array; all it really does is cancel a specific mapping request.
C
C  Language:
C     FORTRAN
C
C  Call:
C     CALL DSA_UNMAP (SLOT,STATUS)
C
C  Parameters:   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C
C     (>) SLOT     (Integer,ref) The handle value allocated when the 
C                  array was originally mapped.
C     (!) STATUS   (Integer,ref) Status value.  If bad status is passed,
C                  this routine returns immediately.

C  History:
C     8th July 1987   Original version.  KS / AAO.
C     20th July 1988  Reflagging of unflagged data added, and type
C                     conversion now done through CNV_FMTCON.  KS / AAO.
C     28th June 1989  Check for variance/error processing added.  KS/AAO.
C     8th  Sept 1989  Control of flag value propagation added.  KS/AAO.
C     12th Mar  1990  Support for variance arrays mapped as uncertainty arrays
C                     added.  KS/AAO.
C     27th Apr  1990  Support for some types of SGP38 structured arrays
C                     added. MAP_STRUCT changed to MAP_SCALED. KS/AAO.
C     21st Aug  1992  Replace CNV_ with DSA_FMTCON, which calls VEC_
C                     routines.  HME / UoE, Starlink.
C     31st Aug  1992  Added use of DSA_WRFLUSH. KS/AAO
C      1st Sep  1992  Usused variable declarations removed. KS/AAO.
C     24th Feb  1993  Arrays are now passed to DSA_FMTCON as arrays instead
C                     of by pointer. KS/AAO.
C      2nd Jul  1993  Now closes down any workspace used to hold flagged
C                     data information. KS/AAO.

C  Note:
C     This version can handle the following types of SGP38 structured
C     arrays: SIMPLE, COMPLEX (when it operates only on the .REAL array)
C     SCALED.  It cannot handle arrays with origins other than 1.0.  It
C     can also handle the original Figaro scaled type 'CSTRUCT' (which
C     DSA__STRUCT_ARRAY treats as a 'SCALED' array)

C     write or update, the first thing we have to do is reverse the
C     processing.  Similarly, if it was an error array generated by
C     processing an error array (the sign of the work slot tells us which
C     processing was performed).

C
C     This routine doesn't actually free any mapped arrays, or any
C     workspace versions of arrays, on the principle that they might
C     be wanted again and it's better to use the memory and keep them
C     than to have to take the overhead of having to map and/or
C     convert them again.  What it does do is force an update of
C     the base array from any workspace arrays mapped for write/update,
C     and decrements the various reference counters so that an (as
C     yet unwritten) garbage-collector might be able to recover unused
C     space if necessary.  Until then, we just assume that DSA_CLOSE
C     will release everything in one go.
C
C     See if the mapping had in fact been to a workspace copy of the data.
C
      WORK_SLOT=MAP_CALL_WORK(SLOT)
      IF (WORK_SLOT.NE.0) THEN
C
C        If the mapping was readonly, we don't have to do very much.
C        There are some 'update' mappings which do not have a real
C        (ie on disk) array associated with them - quality arrays 
C        which are being handled using flagged data.  We don't
C        update them either - how can we?
C
         IF ((MAP_CALL_MODE(SLOT).NE.'R').AND.(MAP_SLOT.GT.0)) THEN
C
C           However, if it was write/update, we update the main array
C           from the workspace version.  This has two stages.  First,
C           we may have to reflag data in the array, then we need to
C           do the actual update.  However, the very first thing we
C           have to do is to sort out the type code (for FMTCON) and 
C           the number of elements involved.  (It might be an idea to 
C           have saved these in common, actually.)
C
            DO I=1,MAX_TYPES
               IF (WORK_TYPE(WORK_SLOT).EQ.TYPE_NAMES(I)) THEN
                  TYPE_CODE=I
                  GO TO 360       ! Break out of I loop
               END IF

            NELM=WORK_BYTES(WORK_SLOT)/TYPE_SIZE(TYPE_CODE)
            OBJ_TYPE_CODE=MAP_CODE(MAP_SLOT)
C
C           Now, has the data been unflagged?
C
            IF (MAP_CALL_FSLOT(SLOT).NE.0) THEN
C
C              Yes, it has been unflagged.  So we need to reflag it.
C
               FLAGS_ADDR=WORK_POINTER(MAP_CALL_FSLOT(SLOT))

            END IF
C
C           Now we can get on with updating the base data array.
C           For a primitive array, all we have to do is a format
C           conversion.

C        If the mapping was directly to the base array, then any changes

C        into work arrays.  So we don't have to do anything here.
