C  Routine name:
C     DSA_ACT_MAP_QUALITY
C
C  Function:
C     Actually performs the mapping of the quality data array in a structure.
C
C  Description:
C     This routine is called by DSA_MAP_QUALITY and does almost all the
C     actual work involved. The reason for the two routines is that this
C     routine can also be called from DSA_PRE_PROCESS_FLAGGED_VALUES and
C     if we let that routine call DSA_MAP_QUALITY directly then we could
C     no longer assume from the fact that DSA_MAP_QUALITY had been called
C     that the application wanted to handle quality. Splitting the
C     routines in this way allows us to make this assumption.
C     This routine maps the quality data array in a structure, returning
C     the address of the mapped array.  The whole array is mapped.  If 
C     there is in fact no quality data array, then one will be created
C     if the mapping specified 'WRITE' or 'UPDATE' and filled with zeros.
C     If the main data array contains flagged values, and the application
C     has not indicated through a call to DSA_USE_FLAGGED_VALUES that it
C     wants to handle these directly, then any flagged values in the
C     data array will be removed and the corresponding elements of the
C     quality array will be set.
C
C  Language:
C     FORTRAN
C
C  Call:
C     CALL DSA_ACT_MAP_QUALITY (REF_NAME,MODE,TYPE,ADDRESS,SLOT,STATUS)
C
C  Parameters:   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C
C     (>) REF_NAME     (Fixed string,descr) The reference name associated
C                      with the structure. 
C     (>) MODE         (Fixed string,descr) One of 'READ','WRITE', or
C                      'UPDATE', indicating the way the data is going to
C                      be accessed.  Only the first character is significant.
C     (>) TYPE         (Fixed string,descr) The type of data array to be
C                      mapped onto the structure array.  This can be 'BYTE',
C                      'CHAR','FLOAT','DOUBLE','SHORT','USHORT' or 'INT'.  
C                      If type conversion is needed, it will be performed 
C                      automatically.
C     (<) ADDRESS      (Integer,ref) The address of the mapped array.
C     (<) SLOT         (Integer,ref) A handle value associated with this
C                      mapping call, which may be used later to unmap
C                      the data explicitly.
C     (!) STATUS       (Integer,ref) Status return code.  If a bad status
C                      value is passed to it, this routine returns
C                      immediately.

C  History:
C     22nd July 1988.   Original version.  KS / AAO.
C     8th  Sept 1989.   Call to DSA_MAP_ARRAY now sets propagation flag
C                       false.  KS/AAO.
C     11th Dec  1989.   Now sets QUAL_UPDATE flag on a write or update
C                       mapping.  KS/AAO.
C     21st Feb  1990.   Uses DSA__QUAL_NAME to remove assumptions about
C                       file format details.  KS/AAO.
C     22nd Apr  1991.   Now uses DSA__CREATE_QUAL_ENV to create the 
C                       environment for the quality array - allows support
C                       of structured arrays including BADBITS values. KS/AAO.
C     1st  May  1991.   Now gets BADBITS value and tests to see if this
C                       is likely to cause problems. KS/AAO.
C     21st Aug 1992     Automatic portability modifications
C                       ("INCLUDE" syntax etc) made. KS/AAO
C     23rd Aug 1992     Remove unused variable declarations. KS/AAO
C     29th Aug 1992     "INCLUDE" filenames now upper case. KS/AAO
C     16th Jun 1993     Now sets 'quality exist' flag if array created. KS/AAO,
C     26th Oct 1994     Now uses new calling sequence for DSA_MAP_ARRAY. KS/AAO.
C      3rd Feb 1995     Now supports files with both flagged data values and
C                       quality arrays. KS/AAO.
C      7th Feb 1995     DSA_MAP_QUALITY now renamed to DSA_ACT_MAP_QUALITY
C                       and replaced by a new routine that calls this one.
C                       REF_SLOT used in call instead of REF_NAME. KS / AAO.
C     30th Nov 1995.    Added possibility that a copy of the array may be
C                       needed. KS/AAO.
C     2005 June 3       Replace DYNAMIC_MEMORY with
C                       %VAL(CNF_PVAL(ADDRESS)) contruct for 64-bit
C                       addressing.  MJC / Starlink

C
      TYPE_UC = TYPE

C
C     Look up the reference name in the tables and get the name
C     of the quality array.
C          
      CALL DSA_REF_SLOT (REF_NAME,REF_SLOT,STATUS)
      CALL DSA__QUAL_NAME (REF_SLOT,OBJ_NAME,LENGTH)
C
C     First find the dimensions of the main data array.  Those of
C     the quality array should match.
C
      CALL DSA_DATA_SIZE (REF_NAME,MAX_AXES,NDIM,DIMS,NELM,STATUS)
C
C     See if there is in fact any quality data, and see if the
C     main data array contains flagged values.
C
      CALL DSA_SEEK_QUALITY (REF_NAME,EXIST,STATUS)
      CALL DSA_SEEK_FLAGGED_VALUES (REF_NAME,FLAGGED,STATUS)

C
C     Initially, assume we want neither to create the array, not to
C     fill it with zeros.
C
      ZERO_FILL = .FALSE.
      CREATE_DUMMY = .FALSE.
C
C     If DSA_MAP_QUALITY is being called directly from the application,
C     then a call that specifies 'WRITE' or 'UPDATE' will expect to see
C     a real array in the final structure and this should be respected,
C     even if the actual data is flagged. However, this routine may be
C     called from DSA_PRE_PROCESS_FLAGGED, in which case we really do
C     want to create a dummy array if one does not exist. We can tell the
C     difference by looking at the 'use quality' flag, which will be set 
C     if we are being called from DSA_MAP_QUALITY.
C
      IF ((.NOT.USE_QUALITY(REF_SLOT)).AND.(.NOT.EXIST)) THEN
         CREATE_DUMMY = .TRUE.
         ZERO_FILL = .TRUE.
      ELSE
C
C        Otherwise, see if the mode requires that the array exist
C
         CHR = MODE(1:1)
         INVOKE = ICH_FOLD(CHR)
C
         IF (EXIST.OR.(CHR.EQ.'W').OR.(CHR.EQ.'U')) THEN
C
C           The quality array either is required to exist or does exist.
C           Either way, we want to map an actual data object, not a dummy
C           array.
C
            IF (.NOT.EXIST) THEN
C
C              If the array did not exist, we need to create one of the
C              same dimensions as the data array.
C
               CALL DSA__CREATE_QUAL_ENV (REF_SLOT,STATUS)
               CALL DSA_CREATE_ARRAY (' ',OBJ_NAME(:LENGTH),TYPE_UC,
     :                                              NDIM,DIMS,STATUS)
               IF (STATUS.NE.0) GO TO 500    ! Error exit
               QUAL_EXIST(REF_SLOT) = 1
            END IF
C
C           There is one case where we need to make a copy of the quality
C           array rather than use the actual one in the file. This is where
C           the quality array exists, but the data is flagged and the
C           application will not use the flagged values, intending to use
C           the quality array instead. If all of this is the case, the
C           quality array will be modified to reflect the flagged data - 
C           but if the quality array is being mapped readonly, then we need
C           a copy of it! So this is an odd combination of circumstances,
C           but one that has to be allowed for.
C
            COPY = (EXIST.AND.(CHR.EQ.'R').AND.FLAGGED.AND.
     :            USE_QUALITY(REF_SLOT).AND..NOT.USE_FLAGS(REF_SLOT)) 
C
C           Map the quality array.
C
            CALL DSA_MAP_ARRAY (OBJ_NAME(:LENGTH),MODE,TYPE_UC,1,NELM,
     :                NELM,COPY,.FALSE.,.FALSE.,ADDRESS,SLOT,STATUS)
C
C           If we just created the array, we will want to fill it with zeros.
C           If it existed already, we should check to see if it has values
C           that should be masked by the BADBITS mask but will be mis-
C           interpreted by DSA as it stands at present.
C
            IF (EXIST) THEN
               CALL DSA__GET_BADBITS (REF_SLOT,BADBITS,IGNORE)
               CALL DSA_CHECK_BADBITS (REF_NAME,%VAL(CNF_PVAL(ADDRESS)),
     :                                    NELM,TYPE_UC,BADBITS,STATUS)
            ELSE
               ZERO_FILL = .TRUE.
            END IF
         ELSE
C
C           There is no quality array, so we need to generate a dummy one.
C           and will want to fill it with zeros.
C
            CREATE_DUMMY = .TRUE.
            ZERO_FILL = .TRUE.
         END IF
      END IF
C
C     Now, after all that, we will either have mapped an array in the
C     structure starting at address ADDRESS (which we may have had to
C     create) or we may have CREATE_DUMMY set.  Either way, we may
C     also have ZERO_FILL set.  
C 
      IF (CREATE_DUMMY) THEN
         CALL DSA_GET_ACTUAL_NAME(REF_NAME,STRUCTURE,STATUS)
         NAME = 'quality array in '//STRUCTURE
         CALL DSA_MAP_DUMMY (NAME,MODE,TYPE_UC,NELM,ADDRESS,SLOT,STATUS)
      END IF
      IF (ZERO_FILL) THEN
         CALL DSA_ZFILL_ARRAY (NELM,ADDRESS,TYPE_UC,STATUS)
      END IF
      IF (STATUS.NE.0) GO TO 500     ! Error exit
C
C     If the mapping was not readonly, set the update flag.
C
      IF (CHR.NE.'R') QUAL_UPDATE(REF_SLOT) = .TRUE.
C
C     Tie in the quality mapping to the reference name in the common tables
C
      QUALITY_SLOT(REF_SLOT) = SLOT
C
C     If the data array has already been mapped, then now is the time to
C     call the quality pre-processing routine.  Note that we can't assume 
C     from the obvious fact that DSA_ACT_MAP_QUALITY has being called that
C     the application wants to handle quality data.  This is because
C     DSA_PRE_PROCESS_FLAGGED_VALUES may call DSA_MAP_QUALITY if a
C     quality array actually exists. But we can use the USE_QUALITY flag
C     to tell the difference.
C
      IF (USE_QUALITY(REF_SLOT).AND.(DATA_SLOT(REF_SLOT).NE.0)) THEN
         CALL DSA_PRE_PROCESS_QUALITY (REF_NAME,STATUS)
      END IF
C
C     Exit
C
  500 CONTINUE
C
      END
