C  Routine name:
C     DSA_WRUSER
C
C  Function:
C     Outputs a message string to the user.
C
C  Description:
C     DSA_WRUSER outputs a message string to the user, buffering it until
C     either a line's worth of output has been received or until a string
C     containing a newline code (`backslash n', as in C's printf) is 
C     received.  So a call to this routine does not necessarily result in 
C     a single line being output immediately to the user.  Output is 
C     through the Figaro parameter system (the routine PAR_WRUSER).
C
C  Language:
C     FORTRAN
C
C  Call:
C     CALL DSA_WRUSER (STRING)
C
C  Parameters:   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C
C     (>) STRING      (Fixed string,descr) The string to be output.  Words
C                     from STRING are buffered and output when the 80 char
C                     buffer is full, or when a newline (backslash n) is 
C                     found in the string.  All spaces in STRING - including
C                     trailing spaces - are treated as significant.
C
C  External variables used -
C     Common variables used internally by the DSA_ package.
C
C  External subroutines / functions used:  PAR_WRUSER
C
C  Prior requirements:  
C     DSA_OPEN should have been called to initialise the DSA_ system.

C
C     Local variables
C
      CHARACTER BACKSLASH*1            ! Holds the backslash character

      INTEGER STATUS                   ! PAR_WRUSER status return - ignored
C
C     Set the backslash character - some UNIX compilers don't like to see
C     this is Fortran code, so this works around it - at the expense of
C     assuming ASCII characters, I'm afraid.
C
      BACKSLASH=CHAR(92)
C
C     Loop through all the characters in the buffer

C           Buffer full, output up to and including last blank.  If

         IF (ESCAPE) THEN
C
C           Previous character was a backslash, so we are in the middle of an
C           escape sequence.  If this is a newline, flush the buffer.
C           Otherwise, just ignore the sequence.
C

C           If character is a backslash then set escape flag.  Otherwise,
C           stuff it into the buffer.
