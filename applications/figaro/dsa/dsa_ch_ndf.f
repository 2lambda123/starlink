      SUBROUTINE DSA_CHECK_NDF_AXIS( REF_SLOT, NDIM, DIMS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DSA_CHECK_NDF_AXIS

*  Purpose:
*     Check an NDF's AXIS structure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DSA_CHECK_NDF_AXIS( REF_SLOT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine is to be called by DSA_CHECK_STRUCTURE just before
*     completing the check and after it is satisfied that the axes are
*     OK. This routine imposes further restrictions on the AXIS
*     structure in an NDF. The AXIS structure may be either absent, or
*     it must adhere to the following:
*     -  There are as many elements in the structure array AXIS as there
*        are dimensions in the NDF (in its data array).
*     -  Each element AXIS(i) contains at least a component DATA_ARRAY.
*     There are certainly more restrictions, but none seem relevant in
*     the sense that DSA adheres to them anyway.

*  Arguments:
*     REF_SLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The common table slot used by the structure to be checked.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensionality of the NDF (or its data array).
*     DIMS( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The dimensions of the NDF (or its data array).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status. If bad status is passed to this routine it
*        returns immediately. This routine always returns good status if
*        it runs.

*  History:
*     15 Oct 1992 (hme):
*        Original version.
*     16 Jun 1993 (hme):
*        Do not use given NDIM for size declaration.
*     13 Feb 1995 (KS):
*        Changed to fix up n-d data arrays by moving them to the extension
*        to the axis structure.
*     19 Jul 1995 (hme):
*        Do not use given NDIM for size declaration.
*     20 Jul 1995 (hme):
*        Take care of case where the 1-D axis data are there, but
*        undefined. DSA and DTA do not have the concept of undefined HDS
*        objects, so we have to invent a new DTA routine for this.

*  For each axis there must be a DATA_ARRAY.

*     Construct a couple of names in order to look for the data array.
*     NAME2 is the name of the axis array in the normal NDF location,
*     while NAME3 is the name of the axis array in the extension used
*     for non-NDF standard items.
         CALL DTA_CRNAM( OBJ_NAMES(REF_SLOT), 'AXIS', 1, I,
     :      NAME, STATUS )

         CALL DTA_CRNAM( NAME, 'MORE.FIGARO.DATA_ARRAY', 0, 0,
     :      NAME3, STATUS )

*     First we look at the array, if any, in the extension. We are only
*     interested in one possibility here, namely that - one way or
*     another - it has been reshaped to a 1D array (this can happen through
*     a call to DSA_RESHAPE_AXIS). If this is the case, it ought to be
*     moved to the standard location, so we do that.
         STATUS = 0
         CALL DSA_ARRAY_SIZE( NAME3, MAX_AXES, TNDIM, TDIMS, ERROR,

         END IF

*     Look at the standard location. Check the size of the data array.
*     If it is multi-dimensional (shock horror!) we can't leave it here,
*     since this violates the NDF format definition. Instead, we move it
*     to the axis extension structure. This will leave the normal axis
*     structure without an array, and the next part of the code will
*     therefore replace it with an innocuous 1D array filled with pixel
*     numbers. This leaves 2 axis arrays in the structure, an n-d array
*     that Figaro can use, and a 1D array for the rest of us.
         STATUS = 0

*           Setting STATUS non-zero makes it look as if the array wasn't
*           found in the normal structure, so a dummy will be created.
               STATUS = 1
            END IF
         END IF

*     At this point STATUS .NE. 0 is equivalent to 'the compulsory 1-D
*     array does not exist'. However, it might be that the array exists
*     and is undefined. I don't know how DSA does this, but it happens.
*     And STATUS would be zero now if that is the case.
*     We use a routine similar to DSA_ARRAY_SIZE to see if the array is
*     defined. If it isn't, we delete it now and set STATUS to 1.
