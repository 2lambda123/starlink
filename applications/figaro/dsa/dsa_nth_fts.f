C  Routine name:
C     DSA_NTH_FITS_ITEM
C
C  Function:
C     Returns details about the Nth FITS item in a structure
C
C  Description:
C     This routine looks at the FITS sub-structure associated with a
C     specified structure, and in particluar at the Nth item in that
C     sub-structure.  If there is such an item, this routine returns
C     the type and size of the item.  The type is returned as a single
C     character indicating which of the various DSA_GET_FITS_{x}
C     routines should be used to access the item.  Most FITS items are
C     scalar and show as having one element.  Only those items that can
C     appear a number of times, such as the comments `COMMENT',
C     `HISTORY' and blank items, will show as having a number of
C     elements.  If the item is not present, this routine returns
C     indicating that but does not treat it as an error and will not
C     generate an error message.  This routine may be used to search
C     completely through the FITS items in a structure, by starting
C     at NTH=1 and continuing until EXIST is returned as false.

C  Language:
C     FORTRAN
C
C  Call:
C     CALL DSA_NTH_FITS_ITEM (REF_NAME,NTH,EXIST,ITEM,ACCESS,ELEMENTS,
C                                                       STRLEN,STATUS)
C
C  Parameters:   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C
C     (>) REF_NAME         (Fixed string,descr) The reference name
C                          associated with the structure in question.
C     (>) NTH              (Integer,ref) The number of the item in
C                          question.
C     (<) EXIST            (Logical,ref) Returned true if such an item
C                          exists, false otherwise.
C     (<) ITEM             (Fixed string,descr) The name of the item in
C                          question.  This should normally be a FITS
C                          keyword, or blank.
C     (<) ACCESS           (Fixed string,descr) A single character that
C                          indicates the routine to be used to access
C                          the item in its `natural' form.  This will be
C                          one of `L',`I',`S',`C',`F',`D', corresponding
C                          to DSA_GET_FITS_L, DSA_GET_FITS_I, etc.  If 
C                          the item exists but cannot be accessed by any
C                          of these routines (for example, because it is
C                          a structure), ACCESS will be set to blank.
C     (<) ELEMENTS         (Integer,ref) The number of elements in the
C                          FITS structure for this item.  This will be
C                          one for all bar the comment items that may
C                          occur multiply.
C     (<) STRLEN           (Integer,ref) If the item is a character string,
C                          this returns the number of characters in it.
C     (<) STATUS           (Integer,ref) Status code.  If bad status is
C                          passed to this routine, it returns immediately.
