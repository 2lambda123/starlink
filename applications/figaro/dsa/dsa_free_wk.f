C  Routine name:
C     DSA_FREE_WORKSPACE
C
C  Function:
C     Releases previously obtained workspace.
C
C  Description:
C     When workspace is obtained through a call to DSA_GET_WORKSPACE,
C     or through a call to DSA_GET_WORK_ARRAY, a handle value (SLOT) 
C     is returned to identify the workspace obtained.  The workspace 
C     can be released through a call to DSA_FREE_WORKSPACE, specifying 
C     that slot number.
C
C  Language:
C     FORTRAN
C
C  Call:
C     CALL DSA_FREE_WORKSPACE (SLOT,STATUS)
C
C  Parameters:   (">" input, "!" modified, "W" workspace, "<" output)
C
C     (>) SLOT        (Integer,ref) The slot number returned by a
C                     call to DSA_GET_WORKSPACE.
C     (!) STATUS      (Integer,ref) Status value.  If bad status is
C                     passed, this routine returns immediately.
C
C  External variables used:
C     Only common variables internal to the DSA_ routines.
C
C  External subroutines / functions used:
C     DSA_WRUSER, EMS_ANNUL, EMS_BEGIN, EMS_END, PSX_FREE
C
C  Prior requirements:
C     DSA_OPEN should have been called to initialise the system.

C     (>) WORK_LINK     (Integer array) Link to other work slots.
C     (>) WORK_POINTER  (Integer array) Memory address of workspace array.
C
C  Subroutine / function details:
C     DSA_WRUSER   Write message to user
C     EMS_ANNUL    Clear any pending EMS error status
C     EMS_BEGIN    Begin a new EMS error reporting environment
C     EMS_END      End the current EMS environment
C     PSX_FREE     Release virtual memory obtained through PSX_MALLOC

C  History:
C     9th  July 1987  Original version.  KS / AAO.
C     28th Sept 1989  Now uses $DELTVA for large arrays.  KS / AAO.
C     21st Aug 1992   Automatic portability modifications
C                     ("INCLUDE" syntax etc) made. KS/AAO
C     29th Aug  1992  Introduced GEN_SUCCESS to handle tests on status values
C                     that follow the VMS convention. KS/AAO.
C     29th Aug  1992  "INCLUDE" filenames now upper case. KS/AAO
C      2nd Sep  1992  Now uses PSX_FREE instead of the VMS routines
C                      LIB$FREE_VM and SYS$DELTVA. KS/AAO.

C
C     Release the virtual memory allocated for the slot. The error reporting 
C     is not as good as it should be here, since we have to disable EMS (DSA 
C     not being a proper EMS environment) and the saving of the bad PSX 
C     status code in VMS_CODE is clearly an historical oddity that should be 
C     sorted out sometime.
