* Name:
*    FIT_CPOLB

* Invocation:
*   (INTEGER) = FIT_CPOLB(WEIGHT,NPTS,X,Y,COEFFS,RSSQ,MAX_FIT,
*                           MAX_KPLUS1,WORK,ATHREE,MAXNPTS)

* Purpose:
*     Performs a least-squares fit to data using
*     Chebyshev polynomials.

* Description:
*     The fit can be of any specified order  up to (MAX_KPLUS1-1).
*     For more information on weighting and other considerations, see
*     the PDA manual.
*     The status of the FIT is returned via the Routine Name. All
*     None Zero values are FAIL conditions
*     Value             CONDITION
*       0                 Ok
*       >0                error

* Arguments
*   WEIGHT(NPTS) = DOUBLE PRECISION ARRAY (Given)
*      Weight Given to each point in the fit.  Points given the weight
*      DELETE = 1E-6 are effectively excluded from the fit.
*   NPTS = INTEGER (Given)
*      Number of Points for fit, including those for which WEIGHT[I] =
*      DELETE
*   X(NPTS) = DOUBLE PRECISION ARRAY (Given)
*      X axis data for fit
*   Y(NPTS) = DOUBLE PRECISION ARRAY (Given)
*      Y axis data for fit
*   MAX_KPLUS1 = INTEGER (Returned)
*      The maximum cheby order + 1 that can be fitted. This is currently
*      set =20
*   RSSQ(MAX_KPLUS1) = DOUBLE PRECISION ARRAY (Returned)
*      Residual Sum of Squares as a function of Order up to MAX_FIT
*   MAX_FIT = INTEGER (Returned)
*      The maximum coeefs that could be used.  This will normally be
*      MAX_KPLUS1. However a test is made to ensure that the number of
*      orders to be fitted does not exceed the number of points for
*      which WEIGHT[I] = DELETE
*   COEFFS(MAX_KPLUS1,MAX_KPLUS1) = DOUBLE PRECISION ARRAY (Returned)
*      The Cheby Poly coeficents for all orders up to MAX_FIT
*   WORK(NPTS*3+2*MAX_KPLUS1) (Workspace)
*   ATHREE(3*MAXNPTS+3*MAX_KPLUS1) = DOUBLE PRECISION ARRAY
*     PDA_DPOLFT fit co-effs

* Subroutines/functions called:
*      PDA_DPLINT              : Least squares Chebyshev polynomial fit
*      ERR_REP          : Output error message if routine fails
*      TAY2CHEB         : Taylor to Chebyshev co-eff convert

* History:
*     Altered to use fig_nagerr, TNW 7/10/88
*     Altered to use getwork, TNW 28/11/88
*     Altered to get wk2 by getwork, and to use dyn_increment, TNW
*     15/12/88
*     Altered 24/2/89 arrays Now passed from above
*     test to see how many points are left which have not
*     been assigned the weight DELETE /DJA?
*     Workspace passed from above, TNW/CAVAD 19/9/90
*     Replaced NAG e02adf with PDA_DPOLFT  JWP March 97
*     Fix PDA call, calculate all RMSs and convert 
*       Taylor series to Cheby AJH Oct 97
*     Remove character strings continued across continuation lines: ACD,
