* Name:
*    CENTRD

* Invocation:
*    CALL CENTRD(CHANS,NCENT,VALUE,COUNT,LEVEL,NOK)

* Purpose:
*    Find centroid

* Description:
*     Service routine for ARC functions
*     Performs a centroiding of the data contained in the array
*     ICHANS over NCENT points.  The centroided channel number
*     returned is expressed in terms of the first element of
*     ICHAN (i.e. 1).  The calling program should therefore
*     take this into account.
*
* Arguments:
*    CHANS(NCENT) = REAL ARRAY (Given)
*        is an array containing NCENT contiguous
*                        channels of data from an arc spectrum.
*    NCENT = INTEGER (Given)
*       
*    LEVEL = REAL (Given)
*        is the discrimination level in counts.
*    VALUE = REAL (Returned)
*        is the centroided channel number returned.
*    COUNT = REAL (Returned)
*        is the count level of the channel in which the
*                         centroid occurs.
*    NOK = INTEGER (Returned)
*        is returned as non-zero if a line is detected,
*                        else zero.
