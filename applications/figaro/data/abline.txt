If you enter a number, it will be taken as the central wavelength for
a new region to be displayed.  The other commands that are accepted are

SIG x     Set 'multiple of sigma' continuum rejection parameter to x
DEG n     Set polynomial degree for continuum fit to n (1..7)
ITN n     Set 'number of iterations' continuum rejection parameter to n
LIMIT     Line will be delimited by the cursor positions indicated
NOLIM     Line delimited by points where data becomes < continuum
WIDTH x   Set wavelength range displayed to x
CONT      Determine continuum, starting with subsegment selection by cursor
RECONT    Repeat continuum fit, using same segments as last time
FIT       Analyse a line, delimiting it using the cursor
HELP      (or ?) Output this information
QUIT      Exit ABLINE.
   
Commands may be abbreviated.  Omitted numeric parameters are prompted for.

Generally, the sequence is: 1) Select center wavelength, 2) CONTinuum,
3) FIT one or more lines.     To change degree of continuum fit,
use DEG followed by RECONT.  Similarly for other continuum parameters.
