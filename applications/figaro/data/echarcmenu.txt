At this stage in ECHARC you have the following options available -

Fit       - Repeat the fit.
O_fit     - Change the order of the fit.
Disp      - Display the deviation of the fit from a linear fit.  This
            shows the trend of the fit, and the errors in each line.
Edit      - Delete or change the wavelength of one or more of the
            selected lines, without returning to the cursor selection.
Reselect  - Return to selection using the cursor.
Continue  - Start to quit this order.
Print     - Prints a copy of the fit (what ARLINES.LIS would look like
            if you were to exit now).
Auto      - Starting from your current fit and arc line list, ARC looks
            for additional line in the arc at wavelengths given in the
            line list and adds any it finds to the identified line tables.
Xauto     - Deletes all the lines found by 'Auto'
Modify    - Allows you some control over the Autofit parameters.
Help      - (or ?) Display this information.

The first letter of each command is sufficient.
