 The autofit algorithm is parameterised as follows- 

 It takes each pixel in turn.  If that pixel is more than CHFACT
 times the current sigma value from any line already found, it uses
 that pixel as the starting point for a line search.  If anything
 resembling a line can be found, it calculates its wavelength and
 looks in the line tables for a line close to that wavelength.
 
 A line is accepted if the discrepancy between calculated and
 tabulated wavelength is less than SIGFACT times the current RMS
 value.  This means that the criterion for accepting new lines
 is based on how their wavelength discrepancies compare with those for
 the lines that have already been accepted.

 SIGFACT is the more important parameter.
