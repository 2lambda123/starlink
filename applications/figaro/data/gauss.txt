     Continuum fitting menu entry. Alternatives are:

        CUR    -    indicate continuum regions by cursor
        ORD    -    order of polynomial fit
        SIG    -    factor*sigma on fit for continuum point rejection
        ERR    -    factor*error on point for rejection from continuum fit
        ITN    -    number of iterations for continuum point rejection
        FIT    -    perform the polynomial fitting 
        GAU    -    proceed to Gaussian fitting ( continuum set )

     Gaussian fitting menu entry. Alternatives are:

        LIM    _    delimit edges of line ( default is adjacent 
                    continuum edges )
        SIN    -    fit a single Gaussian to an indicated line
        NEW    -    introduce a Gaussian at the cursor defined position
        NEX    -    introduce a new Gaussian at the peak
        INCH   -    interactively alter peak position, height or width
        LIS    -    list the Gaussians fitted 
        SEL    -    select a line to be modified
        DEL    -    delete a selected Gaussian
        OPT    -    optimize the fit
        RECAL  -    read a previous fit data file and plot this fit
        HARD   -    plot results of fit for hardcopy device
        SAVE   -    save the Gaussian fit spectrum as a file ( name 
                    prompted for on quitting )
        CON    -    move to another section of continuum for more fitting
        QUIT   -    quit from program ( spectrum analysis complete )
