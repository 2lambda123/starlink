*         T.N.Wilkins Manchester 25/10/88
*              "      Cambridge 17/8/90 Made the same for CSUB and
*                                       FITCONT, called CONTINUUM
*
* REMOVE specifies if the continuum expressed by the Cheby Polynomial
* contained in COEFF has been removed. With the following code
*       SUBRACTED
*       DIVIDED
* WEIGHTS contains the weights used in the cheby polynomial fits
* for each point along the X axis direction. Note that at the moment
* this is 1d and it is therfore assumed that if the data is 2d all
* the Y direction data has the saim weighting structure.
* ORDER gives the order of the polynomial to extract from the COEFFS
