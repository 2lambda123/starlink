Regrettably, the requested application is not included in the Unix release of
Portable Figaro 5.0.

Dipso and Spica formats are not defined on Unix systems. So there is no con-
version to or from those formats. The same holds for the BDF format.

Tape-FITS is not supported, but disk-FITS is. Tape-FITS files must be
copied to disk first.

The blinking applications in Figaro depend on displaying with exactly 256
colours. This is impossible on VAX VWS or Xwindows. Neither is it possible on
Unix Xwindows displays.

The following is a list of applications available in version 3.0 only
and their counterparts in version 5.0 or elsewhere in the Starlink software
collection.
