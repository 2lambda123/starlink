   - Add some sort of clump orientation column
   
   - Include output columns that give clump positions and sizes in WCS units
   
   - Have an option to apply the cellular automata to clean up clumps found
   by clumpfind.
   
   - Include used parameter values in the output catalogue (as catalogue
   parameters)
   
   - Create a textual log file including a table of clump parameters



(22/6/06): Have a second output NDF that contains a copy of the input
