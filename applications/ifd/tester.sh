#  Name:
#     tester.sh

#  Purpose:
#     Automake test script for IFD package.

#  Description:
#     This is a short script which does regression tests on some of 
#     the IFD scripts, comparing output against runs done previously.
#     It is not exhaustive.  It was copied from the old-style Starlink
#     IFD makefile.

#  Exit Value:
#     Zero for success, non-zero for failure.

#  Notes:
#     The tests will only run correctly if they are run *after* 
#     installation, since the scripts source files in $(bindir) to work.
#     This is not the way that make check normally works.

#  Authors:
#     MBT: Mark Taylor (Starlink)

#  History:
#     12-MAY-2003 (MBT):
#        Initial version (taken from original IFD makefile).
