      SUBROUTINE SST_GTPUN( LINE, FOUND, NAME, TYPE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_GTPUN

*  Purpose:
*     Get the name of a Fortran program unit from its declaration.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_GTPUN( LINE, FOUND, NAME, TYPE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine inspects the line of Fortran 77 code supplied to see
*     if it contains a BLOCK DATA, FUNCTION, PROGRAM or SUBROUTINE
*     keyword.  If so, then it extracts the following sequence of
*     contiguous alphanumeric characters and returns them as the
*     program unit name. It also returns a character indicating the
*     type of declaration found.  If no keyword is found, then FOUND is
*     returned as .FALSE. and no program unit name or type is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     LINE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The line of code to be tested (case insensitive). Only the
*        "statement" field should be supplied, the statement number,
*        etc. being omitted.
*     FOUND = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether a program unit name was found.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The program unit name in upper case (not returned if FOUND is
*        .FALSE.). If the variable supplied to receive the result is
*        not long enough, then an ellipsis '...' will be appended.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        One of the characters 'B', 'F', 'P' or 'S' to indicate the
*        type of program unit declaration found (block data, function,
*        program or subroutine respectively). No value is returned if
*        FOUND is .FALSE..
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Dollar ('$'), underscore ('_') and angle brackets ('<' & '>')
*     are recognised as alphanumeric characters by this routine (i.e.
*     they may appear in program unit names).
*     -  It is assumed that spaces are used sensibly in the source code
*     (i.e. they are not embedded in the keywords and program unit
*     name) and that the declaration does not span lines.

*  History:
*     9-AUG-1989 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     8-AUG-1990 (RFWS):
*        Substantial change to remove a line length restriction and the
*        use of an internal character buffer.
*     4-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
*        Corrected wrong string length during comparisons which was
*        causing declarations not to be recognised.
*     6-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
*        Reverted to an earlier version (well nearly) because of
*        problems recognising function declarations with their
*        associated data types using the modified version.
*     7-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
*        Improved the detection of 'FUNCTION' keywords with preceding
*        type declarations.
*     10-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
*        Minor bug fixes on reviewing the code.
