*  Name:
*     SST_ANALP

*  Purpose:
*     Analyse a program unit, counting lines, characters, etc.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_ANALP( PUNAME, PUTYPE, MXCODE, NBLANK, NCODBL,
*                     NCODE, NCODEU, NCOM, NCOMBL, NLINE, NPROL,
*                     NPROLB, NPROLE, NCCHR, EOF, EFFCOM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine reads a program unit from the input file and
*     analyses it. This involves determining its name and type
*     (subroutine, function, etc.) and counting the number of comment
*     lines, code lines, characters, etc. Statistics derived from these
*     counts are returned. The end of a program unit is determined by
*     the occurence of an 'END' statement, or by an end-of-file
*     condition; a flag is returned to indicate which.

*  Arguments:
*     PUNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        Name of the program unit (in upper case). A value of
*        '<unknown>' will be returned if the name cannot be determined.
*     PUTYPE = CHARACTER * ( 1 ) (Returned)
*        The program unit type ('B', 'F', 'P' or 'S'). A value of '?'
*        is returned if the type cannot be determined.
*     MXCODE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The maximum number of contiguous (apart from intervening blank
*        lines) uncommented code lines found in the program unit.
*     NBLANK = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of blank lines found (including lines containing only a
*        single comment character).
*     NCODBL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of blocks of contiguous (apart from intervening blank
*        lines) uncommented code lines found.
*     NCODE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of non-blank code lines found.
*     NCODEU = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of non-blank code lines found which also do not have an
*        end-of-line comment.
*     NCOM = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of non-blank comment lines found in the program unit
*        (i.e. excluding all those which contain only a single comment
*        character). End-of-line comments are not included.
*     NCOMBL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of blocks of contiguous comments found (i.e. not
*        separated by code lines) within the code. Prologue comment
*        lines, prologue delimiting lines and end-of-line comments do
*        not contribute to this count.
*     NLINE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Total number of lines read from the file for the current
*        program unit.
*     NPROL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of non-blank comment lines found in prologues (i.e.
*        excluding all those which contain only a single comment
*        character).
*     NPROLB = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of begin-prologue lines found.
*     NPROLE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of end-prologue lines found.
*     NCCHR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Total number of alphanumeric characters found in comment lines
*        within the program unit, excluding end-of-line comments and
*        those in the prologue.
*     EOF = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether the program unit was terminated by an end-of-file
*        condition.
*     EFFCOM = REAL (Returned)
*        The effective number of in-code comments in the program unit,
*        after allowing for the number of alphanumeric characters in
*        each comment line (a full comment is considered to have 50
*        such characters and those which fall short are counted as
*        fractional lines). End-of-line comments are included in this
*        value, but comments in the prologue are not.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*     4-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     6-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
*        Fixed bug causing the last set of contiguous lines to be
*        ignored.
*     6-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
*        Improved the distinction between in-code comment blocks and
*        prologue comment blocks.
*     28-SEP-1990 (RFWS):

*        end-of-line comments, and to return a separate count of code
*        lines which do not have such comments.
*     28-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
*        Added calls to ERR_MARK and ERR_RLSE.
