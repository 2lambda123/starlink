      SUBROUTINE SST_RMCHR( CHARS, STR )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_RMCHR

*  Purpose:
*     Remove specified characters from a string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_RMCHR( CHARS, STR )

*  Description:
*     The routine removes a specified set of characters from a string,
*     moving remaining characters to the left to eliminate the resulting
*     space(s). Extra spaces on the right are filled with space
*     characters ' '.

*  Arguments:
*     CHARS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A string consisting of all the characters which are to be
*        removed.
*     STR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        String from which characters are to be removed.

*  Initialise count of characters remaining.

*  Loop to test each character.

*  If it is not to be removed, then copy it to its new location in the

*  Fill extra spaces on the right with spaces.
