      SUBROUTINE SST_GTEND( LINE, FOUND, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_GTEND

*  Purpose:
*     Indentify an END statement at the end of a Fortran program
*     module.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_GTEND( LINE, FOUND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine inspects a line of Fortran source code and determines
*     whether it is an END statement which terminates a program module.
*     If it is, then FOUND is returned .TRUE., otherwise FOUND is
*     returned .FALSE..

*  Arguments:
*     LINE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The Fortran source code line to be inspected. Only the
*        "statement" part of the line should be supplied, the statement
*        number, etc. being omitted.
*     FOUND = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether the line is an END statement.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  It is assumed that spaces are used sensibly (i.e. do not
*     appear inside the END keyword) and that the statement does not
*     span lines.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Initialise.
*     -  Find the first and last non-blank characters in the line.
*     -  If the line is not blank, then see if it contains 'END' and
*     nothing else.

*  Arguments Returned:

*  Local Variables:
      INTEGER F                  ! First non-blank character position
      INTEGER L                  ! Last non-blank character position

*  Check inherited global status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  Initialise.
      FOUND = .FALSE.

*  Find the first and last non-blank characters in the line.
      CALL CHR_FANDL( LINE, F, L )

*  If the line is not blank, then see if it contains 'END' and nothing
*  else.
      IF( L .GE. F ) FOUND = CHR_SIMLR( LINE( F : L ), 'END' )

      END
