      SUBROUTINE SST_NWEXT( EXT, FNAME, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*    SST_NWEXT

*  Purpose:
*     Replace/add a new extension to a file name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_NWEXT( EXT, FNAME, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine locates the file extension in the given name and
*     replaces it with a new extension. The signature for a file
*     extension is the first period from the right of the string, that
*     is also left of a given set of delimeters. For UNIX file names the
*     delimeter is '/' for VMS ']' or '>'.

*  Arguments:
*     EXT = CHARACTER * ( * )  (Given)
*        The new extension for the file name. This should include the
*        period.
*     FNAME = CHARACTER * ( * )  (Given and Returned)
*        The filename. On exit this is the new name.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Machine-Specific Features Used:
*     Uses the system specific routine SST_SYSNM.
