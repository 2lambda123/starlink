      SUBROUTINE SST_CAPWD( STR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_CAPWD

*  Purpose:
*     Capitalise words in a character string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_CAPWD( STR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine converts the initial character of each word in the
*     character string supplied to upper case and converts all other
*     characters to lower case. In this context a word is a sequence of
*     non-blank characters following a blank (plus the first sequence
*     in the string).

*  Arguments:
*     STR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The character string.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
