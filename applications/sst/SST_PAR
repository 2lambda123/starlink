*  Name:
*     SST_PAR

*  Purpose:
*     Define global constants used by the SST routines.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global constants include file.

*  Description:
*     This include file defines the values of global constants used by
*     the SST routines and applications which call them. Its main
*     purpose is to define the size of arrays held in common.

*  Authors:
*     RFWS: R.F. Warren-Smith (STARLINK)
*     PWD: Peter W. Draper (STARLINK, Durham University)

*  History:
*     8-AUG-1990 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     14-APR-2005 (PWD):
*        Add parameterization of printable backslash.

*  Global Constants:

*  Maximum length of a line in the internal source code buffer.
      INTEGER SST__SZLIN
      PARAMETER ( SST__SZLIN = 132 )

*  Maximum number of lines in the internal source code buffer.
      INTEGER SST__MXLIN
      PARAMETER ( SST__MXLIN = 5000 )

*  Printable backslash: some compilers need '\\' to get '\', which
*  isn't a problem as Fortran will truncate the string '\\' to '\' 
*  on the occasions when that isn't needed.
      CHARACTER * ( 1 ) SST__BKSLH
      PARAMETER ( SST__BKSLH = '\\' )
