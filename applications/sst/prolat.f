      SUBROUTINE PROLAT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PROLAT

*  Purpose:
*     Converts routine prologue information into Latex documentation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PROLAT( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This application reads a series of Fortran 77 source code files
*     containing prologue information formatted using STARLSE (SUN/105)
*     and produces an output file containing Latex user documentation
*     for each routine. The documentation format may be chosen to suit
*     either a package of application programs (i.e.  ADAM A-tasks) or
*     a set of ordinary subroutines or functions, such as a subroutine
*     library.

*  Usage:
*     PROLAT IN [OUT]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ATASK = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If ATASK is set to TRUE, then a style of documentation
*        suitable for a package of application programs (i.e. ADAM
*        A-tasks) is produced. If it is set to FALSE, then the
*        documentation produced is suitable for a subroutine library.
*        [TRUE]
*     DOCUMENT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If DOCUMENT is set to TRUE, then the output file will be a
*        complete Latex document and will contain all necessary layout
*        definitions, etc. Such a file may be passed directly to Latex
*        for processing. If DOCUMENT is set to FALSE, then the output
*        file will contain only the information extracted from the
*        input files. In this case, additional Latex commands must be
*        added to produce a complete document (see the Latex
*        Definitions section for details). This latter option would
*        typically be used when the output is to be included in a
*        larger document which already contains the necessary
*        definitions. [TRUE]
*     IN() = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of (optionally wild-carded) file specifications which
*        identify the Fortran 77 source code files to be used for
*        input. Up to 10 values may be given, but only a single
*        specification such as '*.FOR' is normally required.
*
*        If the SINGLE parameter is set to TRUE (the default), then
*        only a single prologue will be expected in each input file. If
*        it is set to FALSE, then there is no limit to the number of
*        prologues which may be held in each input file.
*     OUT = FILE (Write)
*        The output file to which the Latex documentation will be
*        written. [PROLAT.TEX]
*     PAGE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If PAGE is set to TRUE, then a new output page will be started
*        to hold the information extracted from each input prologue.
*        If PAGE is set to FALSE, then this will not occur.  The
*        default behaviour is to start each prologue description on a
*        new page for applications packages (ADAM A-tasks), but for
*        routine descriptions in subroutine libraries to follow
*        end-to-end. []
*     SINGLE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If SINGLE is set to TRUE, then only a single prologue will be
*        expected at the start of each input file; if the file contains
*        more than one prologue, then the remaining ones will be
*        ignored. If SINGLE is set to FALSE, then each input file will
*        be searched for all the prologues it contains and each will be
*        processed in turn. When appropriate, the former option (the
*        default) will result in faster execution since only the
*        initial prologue information must then be read, rather than
*        the entire contents of each input file.  [TRUE]

*  Examples:
*     PROLAT MYPROG.FOR MYPROG.TEX
*        Extracts prologue information from the application program
*        source code held in the file MYPROG.FOR and produces a Latex
*        user document for it.  The Latex output is written to the file
*        MYPROG.TEX.
*     PROLAT *.FOR OUT=SUBS.TEX ATASK=FALSE
*        Extracts prologue information for a subroutine library, whose
*        source code resides in the files *.FOR, one routine per file.
*        A Latex document describing the routines is written to the
*        file SUBS.TEX.
*     PROLAT IN=SOURCE.FOR NOATASK NODOCUMENT NOSINGLE
*        Extracts prologue information from a sequence of subroutines
*        or functions which are all held in the file SOURCE.FOR and
*        produces Latex output in the default output file PROLAT.TEX.
*        This output file contains only the routine descriptions (no
*        Latex definitions) and is therefore suitable for inclusion in
*        a larger document.
*     PROLAT IN=["*.FOR","*.GEN"] NOATASK PAGE
*        In this example, a sequence of input file specifications is
*        given. Each will be processed in turn to generate Latex
*        documentation from the first prologue encountered in each
*        file.  Output is written to the file PROLAT.TEX with the
*        description of each routine starting on a new page.

*  Notes:
*     Care must be taken to ensure that begin-prologue and end-prologue
*     lines (starting '*+' and '*-' respectively) appear before and
*     after each prologue and that '+' and '-' symbols are not used in
*     the second column elsewhere in the file, otherwise prologues may
*     not be correctly identified.

*  Timing:
*     The execution time is approximately proportional to the amount of
*     information to be read from the input files. In addition, the
*     time will be increased somewhat if the input code resides in a
*     large number of separate files, due to the need to open and close
*     each file. If there is only one prologue in each input file, then
*     execution time will be minimised if SINGLE is set to TRUE, since
*     only the initial prologue information need then be read, rather
*     than the entire contents of each file.

*  Latex Definitions:
*     If the DOCUMENT=FALSE option is chosen, then the output file will
*     contain none of the Latex command definitions needed to produce
*     the final document. To define these commands, the contents of the
*     file SST_DIR:LAYOUT.TEX must be included in the Latex input file
*     in front of the output from PROLAT (the usual Latex preamble and
*     \begin{document} ... \end{document} commands will also be needed,
*     of course). The layout definitions in this file are designed to
*     operate correctly within the Latex environment normally used in a
*     Starlink User Note (see the file DOCSDIR:SUN.TEX for example).
*
*     It is recommended that you include the contents of the file
*     SST_DIR:LAYOUT.TEX in your final document explicitly rather than
*     by using the Latex \include directive, otherwise it may not be
*     possible to process the document in future if changes have to be
*     made to the Latex definitions in this file.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
