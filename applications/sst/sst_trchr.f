      SUBROUTINE SST_TRCHR( FROM, TO, STR )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_TRCHR

*  Purpose:
*     Translate characters in a string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_TRCHR( FROM, TO, STR )

*  Description:
*     This routine uses a character translation table to convert
*     selected characters in a string into specified different
*     characters. Any characters not appearing in the translation table
*     are left unchanged.

*  Arguments:
*     FROM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A string composed of the characters to be translated.
*     TO = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A string composed of the translation values for each of the
*        characters in the FROM argument. The lengths of the FROM and
*        TO arguments must be the same.
*     STR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The string to be translated. Any character matching one of the
*        characters specified in the FROM argument is converted to the
*        corresponding character specified in the TO argument. All
*        other characters are left unchanged.
