      SUBROUTINE SST_HTMLS( INDENT, INC, NULL, FIRST, LAST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_HTMLS

*  Purpose:
*     Output the body of a section formatted in "section" mode as html.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_HTMLS( INDENT, INC, NULL, FIRST, LAST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine sends all the lines in the body of a prologue section
*     formatted in section mode (i.e. as a series of sub-sections, each
*     with a header line and a body) to the output file as Latex
*     source.  Indentation is adjusted to a specified level. The body
*     of each sub-section is output in paragraph mode.

*  Arguments:
*     INDENT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The level of indentation at which sub-section headers are to
*        appear.
*     INC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The additional indentation incremant to be applied to the body
*        of each sub-section.
*     NULL = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the headings of sub-sections which have no body are to
*        be output.
*     FIRST = INTEGER (Given)
*        First line number in the SCB to be processed.
*     LAST = INTEGER (Given)
*        Last line number in the SCB to be processed.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     8-JAN-1990 (RFWS):
*        Original, derived from the SST_PUTS routine.
*     5-DEC-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Added double \ for UNIX port.
*     6-DEC-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Converted to html. Derived from the SST_LATS routine.
