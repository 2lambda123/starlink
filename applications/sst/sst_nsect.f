      SUBROUTINE SST_NSECT( MATCH, N, NAME, HEADER, FIRST, LAST,
     :                      STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_NSECT

*  Purpose:
*     Find a named top-level section in a routine prologue.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_NSECT( MATCH, N, NAME, HEADER, FIRST, LAST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches the prologue lines held in the internal
*     source code buffer to identify a section having one (or
*     alternatively having none) of the names specified. Trailing
*     colons are ignored. Searching commences at line HEADER + 1 (or
*     line 1 if HEADER is zero) and the header line number of the
*     section found is returned in HEADER. Zero is returned if no
*     suitable section is found. The first and last line numbers of the
*     body of the identified section are returned in FIRST and LAST. If
*     no body exists, then FIRST wii be greater than LAST.

*  Arguments:
*     MATCH = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If .TRUE., then the section name must match one of the names
*        supplied. If .FALSE., then it must match none of these names.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of names to test against.
*     NAME( N ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        List of names for section identification.
*     HEADER = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Searching commences at line HEADER + 1 and the header line
*        number of the identified section is returned in this argument.
*     FIRST = INTEGER (Returned)
*        First line number of the body of the section.
*     LAST = INTEGER (Given)
*        Last line number of the body of the section.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
