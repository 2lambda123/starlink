      SUBROUTINE SST_CLEAN( STR )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_CLEAN

*  Purpose:
*     Convert Fortran to upper case, removing multiple spaces.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_CLEAN( STR )

*  Description:
*     The routine "cleans" a Fortran 77 code line by converting all
*     unquoted lower case characters to upper case and changing all
*     unquoted multiple spaces to single spaces.

*  Arguments:
*     STR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        Character string containing code line.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Initialise.
*     -  Loop to process each character.
*     -  Convert unquoted lowercase characters to upper case.
*     -  If unquoted spaces are encountered, only retain the first one,
*     setting a "multiple space" flag to prevent subsequent ones being
*     used.
*     -  Transfer other characters to their new position in the string.
*     -  Note when quote characters are encountered and toggle a quote
*     flag.
*     -  Reset the "multiple space" flag after a character which is not
*     an unquoted space.
*     -  Eliminate any characters that remain at the end of the
*     processed string.

*  Note that such a space has been encountered to prevent any more
*  being retained until another character which is not an unquoted
*  space is found.
