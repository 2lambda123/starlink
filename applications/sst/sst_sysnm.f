      SUBROUTINE SST_SYSNM( SYSNAM, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*    SST_SYSNM

*  Purpose:
*     Returns the operating system name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_SYSNM( SYSNAM, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the operating system name. The only
*     differentiation is between UNIX and VMS at present.

*  Arguments:
*     SYSNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        Name of the system, either UNIX or VMS.
