      SUBROUTINE PROHLP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PROHLP

*  Purpose:
*     Converts routine prologue information into a help library input
*     file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PROHLP( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This application reads a series of Fortran 77 source code files
*     containing prologue information formatted using STARLSE (SUN/105)
*     and produces an output file containing user documentation for
*     each routine in a format suitable for insertion into a help
*     library. The help library format may be chosen to suit either a
*     package of application programs (i.e. ADAM A-tasks) or a set of
*     ordinary subroutines or functions, such as a subroutine library.

*  Usage:
*     PROHLP IN [OUT]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ATASK = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If ATASK is set to TRUE, then a help library format suitable
*        for a package of application programs (i.e. ADAM A-tasks) is
*        produced. If it is set to FALSE, then the help library format
*        produced is suitable for a subroutine library.  [TRUE]
*     IN() = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of (optionally wild-carded) file specifications which
*        identify the Fortran 77 source code files to be used for
*        input. Up to 10 values may be given, but only a single
*        specification such as '*.FOR' is normally required.
*
*        If the SINGLE parameter is set to TRUE (the default), then
*        only a single prologue will be expected in each input file. If
*        it is set to FALSE, then there is no limit to the number of
*        prologues which may be held in each input file.
*     OUT = FILE (Write)
*        The output file to which the help information will be written.
*        The information in this file will need to be inserted into a
*        help library for use.  [PROHLP.HLP]
*     SINGLE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If SINGLE is set to TRUE, then only a single prologue will be
*        expected at the start of each input file; if the file contains
*        more than one prologue, then the remaining ones will be
*        ignored. If SINGLE is set to FALSE, then each input file will
*        be searched for all the prologues it contains and each will be
*        processed in turn. When appropriate, the former option (the
*        default) will result in faster execution since only the
*        initial prologue information must then be read, rather than
*        the entire contents of each input file.  [TRUE]

*  Examples:
*     PROHLP PROG.FOR PROG.HLP
*        Extracts prologue information from the application program
*        source code held in the file PROG.FOR and produces a help
*        library entry for it. The program's name is used as the
*        level-1 help keyword. The output is written to the file
*        PROG.HLP.
*     PROHLP *.FOR OUT=SUBS.HLP ATASK=FALSE
*        Extracts prologue information for a subroutine library, whose
*        source code resides in the files *.FOR, one routine per file.
*        Help library entries describing the routines are written to
*        the file SUBS.HLP, with each routine's name being used as a
*        level-1 help keyword.
*     PROHLP IN=SOURCE.FOR NOATASK NOSINGLE
*        Extracts prologue information from a sequence of subroutines
*        or functions which are all held in the file SOURCE.FOR and
*        produces help library entries for them in the default output
*        file PROHLP.HLP. Each routine name is used to form a separate
*        level-1 help keyword.
*     PROHLP IN=["A*.FOR","B*.FOR"] NOATASK
*        In this example, a sequence of input file specifications is
*        given. Each will be processed in turn to generate a help file
*        entry from the first prologue encountered in each file.
*        Output is written to the file PROHLP.HLP. Once again, each
*        routine name generates a separate level-1 help keyword.

*  Notes:
*     Care must be taken to ensure that begin-prologue and end-prologue
*     lines (starting '*+' and '*-' respectively) appear before and
*     after each prologue and that '+' and '-' symbols are not used in
*     the second column elsewhere in the file, otherwise prologues may
*     not be correctly identified.

*  Timing:
*     The execution time is approximately proportional to the amount of
*     information to be read from the input files. In addition, the
*     time will be increased somewhat if the input code resides in a
*     large number of separate files, due to the need to open and close
*     each file. If there is only one prologue in each input file, then
*     execution time will be minimised if SINGLE is set to TRUE, since
*     only the initial prologue information need then be read, rather
*     than the entire contents of each file.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
