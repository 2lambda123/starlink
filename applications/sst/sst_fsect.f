      SUBROUTINE SST_FSECT( HEADER, FIRST, LAST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_FSECT

*  Purpose:
*     Find the next prologue section in the source code buffer.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_FSECT( HEADER, FIRST, LAST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches prologue lines in the source code buffer,
*     starting at line HEADER+1 to find a new section header line which
*     is non-blank and is indented no less than the initial HEADER line
*     (or is simply non-blank if HEADER is initially zero). The
*     resulting line number is returned in HEADER. The routine then
*     locates the first and last non-blank lines in the body of the
*     section (which terminates at the next header as defined by the
*     algorithm above) and returns these line numbers in FIRST and
*     LAST.

*  Arguments:
*     HEADER = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Line number of the header line.
*     FIRST = INTEGER (Returned)
*        First line of section body.
*     LAST = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Last line of section body.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If no header is found, HEADER is returned as zero.
*     -  If the section identified has no body, then FIRST is returned
*     greater than LAST.
