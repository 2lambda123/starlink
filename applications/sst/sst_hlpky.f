      SUBROUTINE SST_HLPKY( STR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_HLPKY

*  Purpose:
*     Make a help library key out of a supplied character string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_HLPKY( STR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine modifies the character string supplied so that it
*     makes a suitable help library key. It is intended to be applied
*     to parameter names and section headings extracted from routine
*     prologues. It performs its task by removing any parenthesised
*     part of the string (e.g. a dimensionality specification on the
*     end of a parameter name) and then replaces all embedded blanks by
*     underscores '_'.

*  Arguments:
*     STR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The string to be modified.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
