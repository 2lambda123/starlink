      SUBROUTINE SST_FPARX( STR, F, L )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_FPARX

*  Purpose:
*     Find a parenthesised expression in a character string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_FPARX( STR, F, L )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches the string STR to identify a sub-string
*     containing a parenthesised expression and returns the character
*     positions of the opening and closing parentheses in the F and L
*     arguments. Allowance is made for nested parentheses. If a
*     parenthesesed expression was not found, then the returned value
*     of F will be greater than the returned value of L.

*  Arguments:
*     STR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        String to be searched.
*     F = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Character position of the opening parenthesis.
*     L = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Character position of the closing parenthesis.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Initialise.
*     -  Inspect each character in the string to identify the opening
*     parenthesis. If found, then note its position.
*     -  If an opening parentheses was found, then search subsequent
*     characters for the closing parenthesis.
*     -  Initialise the count of nested parentheses.
*     -  Count opening parentheses.
*     -  Count closing parentheses.
*     -  If the count of nested parentheses falls to zero, then the
*     closing parenthesis has ben found, so note its position.

      FOUND = .FALSE.

*  Inspect each character in the string, looking for an opening
*  parenthesis.

*  If found, then note its position.

            F = I
            GO TO 2
         END IF
1     CONTINUE
2     CONTINUE

*  If the start of an expression has been found, then search for the
*  end.
      IF ( FOUND ) THEN

*  Initialise the count of nested parentheses.
         IPAR = 1

*  Loop to inspect subsequent characters in the string.
         DO 3 I = F + 1, LEN( STR )

*  Count opening parentheses.
            IF ( STR( I : I ) .EQ. '(' ) THEN
               IPAR = IPAR + 1

*  Count closing parentheses.
            ELSE IF ( STR( I : I ) .EQ. ')' ) THEN
               IPAR = IPAR - 1

*  If the number of nested parentheses falls to zero, then the final
*  character of the expression has been found. Note its position.
               IF ( IPAR .EQ. 0 ) THEN
                  L = I
                  GO TO 4
