      SUBROUTINE SST_ZAPAP( LINE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_ZAPAP

*  Purpose:
*     Remove "old style" ADAM placeholders from a prologue line.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_ZAPAP( LINE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches a source code line to identify those "old
*     style" ADAM placeholders which are often left in place within
*     prologues. It replaces them with blanks.

*  Arguments:
*     LINE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The source code line to be processed.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
