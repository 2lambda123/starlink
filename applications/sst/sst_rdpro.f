      SUBROUTINE SST_RDPRO( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SST_RDPRO

*  Purpose:
*     Read the input file prologue into the internal source code buffer.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SST_RDPRO( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine reads lines from the current input file until a
*     "begin prologue" delimiting line (e.g. '*+') is found. Subsequent
*     comment lines are then read into the internal source code buffer
*     (with their comment characters replaced by blanks) until an "end
*     prologue" delimiting line (e.g. '*-') is encountered. Reading
*     then stops. Reading will also stop if an end of file is
*     encountered.  On successful exit, the internal source code buffer
*     also contains the number of prologue lines read and the first and
*     last character positions in each line. Any previous contents of
*     this buffer are over-written. The input file is left positioned
*     following the last read operation (i.e. ready to find the next
*     prologue if it exists).

*  Notes:
*     -  Any non-printing characters in prologue lines are converted to
*     blanks.
*     -  Those STARLSE placeholders which are intended to be left in
*     place in prologues are also detected and replaced with blanks.

*  History:
*     20-DEC-1989 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     22-DEC-1989 (RFWS):
*        Added call to remove STARLSE placeholders from prologue lines.
*     13-AUG-1990 (RFWS):
*        Changed to exit without error on end-of-file.
*     13-AUG-1990 (RFWS):
*        Fixed bug whereby completely blank lines were ignored, causing
*        new paragraphs to be missed.
*     14-AUG-1990 (RFWS):
*        Changed to use SST_GET instead of READ.
*     28-SEP-1990 (RFWS):
*        Added calls to ERR_MARK and ERR_RLSE.
