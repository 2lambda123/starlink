This is Pat Wallace's ASTROM package.  I've imported it into my CVS
repository in order to apply to it, on a branch, patches I've recently
developed.  This import does _not_ include astrom_source.tar or
sun5.htx_tar, both of which are generated files.  That means that it
doesn't build as it is, since the makefile insists on trying to
extract each of the source files from the tarball -- you can get around
this by adjusting the TAR_OUT environment variable in the mk script.

On the CVS head, I've modified the makefile so that it doesn't require
the source tarball to be present.  And I added a regression test
directory, t.
