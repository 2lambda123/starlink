Pat,

I've made some changes to ASTROM, to fit in with what I needed for the 
autoastrometry project.  The changes are:

    - After each fit, the transformation can be written out to a
      FITS-WCS header, which I believe conforms to the recommendations 
      in the Greisen and Calabretta papers, and which an AST FitsChan
      can read in.

    - The program can now also write a log file containing essentially 
      the same information as is written to the summary file, but in a 
      more easily parseable format.

As a consequence, the astrom.x program can now take six arguments,
with the fifth being a prefix for the FITS file name, and the sixth
the name of the log file.  If both these arguments are missing, the
behaviour should be identical to your original program.

Deficiencies:

    - The design of the format of the log file is rather scrappy.  At
      present, it does what I need and little more.  If you think this 
      is a useful feature, I'd imagine you yourself would want to
      think carefully about how to design it, and I wouldn't want to
      second-guess you.

    - I haven't made any change to the astrom csh script.  Partly this 
      was because I can call the program from my script directly as
      astrom.x; but also it was because with more arguments, the
      question of the interface to the program becomes more subtle,
      and I'd guess you'd have your own opinions about that.

There's a script test-astrom which illustrates the modified usage.

All the best,

Norman
