      SUBROUTINE SCULIB_3POS_CONFN (BSEP, PIXSEP, NPIX, NCFN, CONF,
     :  STATUS)

*  Name:
*     SCULIB_3POS_CONFN

*  Purpose:
*     Generate a convolution function to remove the 3-position
*     chop function from raster scans.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SCULIB_3POS_CONFN (BSEP, PIXSEP, NPIX, NCFN, CONF,
*    :  STATUS)

*  Description:
*     This routine will return the convolution function
*     required for deconvolving the 3-position chop from a scan.
*
*     This function consists of a series of delta functions at a spacing
*     equal to that between a -ve spike and the central spike of the 
*     3-position chop. The height of the delta dunctions peaks at the
*     centre of the convolution function and falls off by 1 at a time for
*     the delta functions on either side, so that the envelope of the
*     function is an isosceles triangle.
*
*     The convolution function must cover the scan even when the centre of
*     the function is at one end of it. Hence, the convolution function
*     must be twice the length of the scan.
*
*     Since the raw data are not sampled such that the chop spacing is an
*     integer number of samples, the actual convolution function must be
*     rebinned onto the sample mesh by sinc interpolation.
*     
*  Arguments:
*     BSEP = REAL (Given)
*        The beam separation in arcseconds
*     PIXSEP = REAL (Given)
*        The pixel separation in arcseconds
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in the x direction
*     NCFN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The length of the convolution array
*     CONF( * ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The convolution function
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        Global status
