*  Name:
*     SCULIB_2POS_CONFN

*  Purpose:
*     Generate a convolution function to remove the 2-position
*     chop function from raster scans.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SCULIB_2POS_CONFN (BSEP, PIXSEP, NPIX, UNBAL, NCFN, CONF,
*    :  STATUS)

*  Description:
*     This routine will return the asymmetric convolution function
*     required for deconvolving a dual beam map into a single beam map.
*     It is the convolution function that is derived in Emerson Klein
*     and Haslam (1979) Astron. Astrophys. 76 p92 paper.
*
*    For the case where UNBAL = 1, the two beams are of equal strength:-
*
*     The ideal convolution function would be the one whose FT was the
*     inverse of the FT of the chop function. Unfortunately, the chop
*     function FT has zeroes in it, at which the inverse FT will tend to
*     infinity. The ideal convolution function, therefore, does not exist.
*     This problem is avoided by generating a function whose FT is the
*     same as the ideal function except at the problem points, where it is
*     set to zero. This function consists of a series of delta functions
*     separated by the chop spacing, the central 2 points being half the
*     chop spacing on either side of the centre of the function. 
*
*     The function is normalised such that convolving this function with
*     an original chop function of 2 delta functions of unit height will 
*     give a delta function of height 1.
*
*    Don't understand what happens when UNBAL <> 1, but the code has left
*    doing the same as NOD2.
*
*     The convolution must cover the map even when the centre of the function
*     is at the left or right hand extremity of the map. Hence the convolution
*     function must be twice the length of the raw map.
*
*     Since the raw data is not sampled such that the chop spacing is an
*     integer number of samples, the actual convolution function must be 
*     rebinned onto the sample mesh by sinc interpolation.
*     
*     This routine is essentially a rewritten version of CONF22 from the
*     RESTOR program in the NOD2 package by Haslam (1974) Astron.
