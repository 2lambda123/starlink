*  Name:
*     SCULIB_PHOTOM_BOLSELECT

*  Purpose:
*     select photometers for a PHOTOM observation

*  Description:
*     This routine selects the bolometers to be used in a PHOTOM observation.
*     If status is good on entry the routine will start by setting to zero
*     the arrays describing which bolometers have been selected. Then it will
*     call SCULIB_BOLSELECT to get the chan/ADC numbers of the bolometers
*     directly specified in BOLOMETERS.
*       The observer can specify between 1 and 3 bolometers by name. Otherwise
*     an error will be reported and the routine will return with bad status. 
*     Likewise, if any of these directly selected bolometers have bad quality
*     or have identical Nasmyth offsets.
*       Now the routine branches on the number of directly selected bolometers:-
*
*      3 bolometers specified. In this case the observer must want to chop 
*      between 3 bolometers on an array.
*        All 3 bolometers should belong to a single array, if not the routine
*      will error and return with bad status. The routine will arbitrarily 
*      assign the 3 bolometers to the `left', 'middle' and `right' projected 
*      positions in the order they were selected. The routine now checks that 
*      the 3 bolometers do lie in roughly a straight line on the sky (allowing 
*      for distortion) and that the left and right bolometers lie roughly the 
*      same distance on either side of the middle. Errors will occur and the 
*      routine return with bad status if these conditions are not met.
*        If all is OK the routine will now store the channel/ADC numbers of
*      the directly selected bolometers, set CHOP_COORDS to Nasmyth, the
*      bolometer spacing to half the distance between the left and right,
*      the chopper position angle, and the instrument `centre' to the coords of
*      the middle bolometer.
*        Next, the routine will search the bolometers belonging to the other
*      array. If 3 can be found that match the positions of the 3 direct
*      bolometers and have good quality then the routine will store the
*      channel/ADC numbers of those bolometers as well.
*        Lastly, the routine will set the bolometers to actually be measured
*      to all those belonging to the array(s) containing the bolometers
*      already selected.
*
*      2 bolometers specified. In this case the observer must want to observe 
*      a source by chopping between the 2 named bolometers. 
*        The routine will arbitrarily call the first of the 2 bolometers
*      the `middle' projected bolometer, the second `right'. Then it will
*      store the channel/ADC numbers of these directly selected bolometers and 
*      set the types of sub-instruments that they imply. If any of the 
*      sub-instruments are arrays the routine will search for bolometer(s) 
*      at the same Nasmyth offset in the other array and select them too.
*        Lastly, the routine will set the bolometers to actually be measured
*      to all those in the selected sub-instruments. CHOP_COORDS is set to 
*      Nasmyth, the bolometer spacing to the distance between the 
*      directly selected bolometers, the chopper position angle is set, and 
*      the instrument `centre' to the Nasmyth coords of the middle bolometer.
*
*      1 bolometer specified. In this case the observer must want to observe 
*      a source without chopping between different bolometers.
*        The routine will arbitrarily call the primary selected bolometer
*      the `middle' projected bolometer. `Left' and `right' bolometers will
*      not be assigned.
*        The routine will now store the channel/ADC numbers of the directly
*      selected bolometer and set the type of sub-instrument that is implied. 
*      If the sub-instrument is one of the arrays the routine will search 
*      for a bolometer at the same Nasmyth offset in the other array and 
*      select it too.
*        Lastly, the routine will set the bolometers to actually be measured
*      to all those in the selected sub-instruments. The instrument `centre'
*      is set to the Nasmyth offset of the primary selected bolometer. 
*      CHOP_COORDS, the bolometer spacing and chopper position angle are
*      all set to bad values so that the calling routine knows these have to
*      be read explicitly from the observation definition file.
*
*     Finally, SCULIB_BOLSELECT is called to select for measurement all the
*     bolometers belonging to the sub-instruments involved in this PHOTOM
*     observation. An array is then calculated holding the index in the array
*     of ALL the photometers to be measured of each projected bolometer
*     in each sub-instrument that was directly selected.
