*  Description:
*     This routine takes data with a variance array and x y positions
*     and regrids it onto a rectangular grid using a weight function
*     interpolation.
*     Here is a description:
*     This is an image space implementation of fourier techniques.
*     In Fourier terms the technique could be described
*     as follows:-
*
*     1. Do a 2-d discrete Fourier transform of the data points. The result
*     is a repeating pattern made up of copies of the transform of
*     the map as a continuous function, each copied displaced from its
*     neighbours by 1/dx, where dx is the sample spacing of the input points
*     (assumed equal in x and y). Different copies of the 'continuous map' 
*     transforms will overlap ('alias') if there is any power in the 
*     map at frequencies greater than 1/(2dx). It is not possible to unravel
*     aliased spectra and this constraint leads to the Nyquist sampling
*     criterion.
*
*     2. We want to derive the 'continuous map' so that map values on the new
*     grid mesh can be derived. Do this by multiplying the transform of the
*     data by a function that has zero value beyond a radius of 0.5/dx from the
*     origin. This will get rid of all the repeats in the pattern and leave
*     just the transform of the 'continuous map'.
*
*     3. Do an inverse FT on the remaining transform for the points where you
*     wish the resampled points to be (note: FFTs implicitly assume that the
*     data being transformed DO repeat ad infinitum so we'd have to be careful
*     when using them to do this).
*
*     The analogue of these process steps in image space is as follows:
*
*     1. Nothing.
*     2. Convolve the input data with the FT of the function used to isolate
*     the 'continuous map' transform.
*     3. Nothing.

*     If the method is done properly, the rebinned map is in fact the map on
*     the new sample mesh that has the same FT as the continuous function
*     going through the original sample points.
*
*     Convolution Functions
*     ---------------------
*
*     Bessel 
*     For good data and with no time constraint on reduction the best
*     convolution function would be one whose FT is a flat-topped cylinder in
*     frequency space, centred on the origin and of a radius such that
*     frequencies to which the telescope is not sensitive are set to zero.
*     Unfortunately, this function is a Bessel function, which extends to
*     infinity along both axes and has significant power out to a large radius.
*     To work correctly this would require an infinite map and infinite
*     computing time. However, a truncated Bessel function should work well on
*     a large map, except near the edges. Edge effects can be removed by
*     pretending that the map extends further - of course, this only works if
*     you know what data the pretend map area should contain, i.e. zeros. 
*     
*     Another problem with a Bessel function arises from the fact that it does
*     truncate the FT of the map sharply. If the data are good then there 
*     should be nothing but noise power at the truncation radius and the 
*     truncation of the FT should have no serious effect. However, if the data
*     has spikes (power at all frequencies in the FT) or suffers from seeing 
*     effects such that the data as measured DO have power beyond the 
*     truncation radius, then this will cause ringing in the rebinned map.
*     
*     Gaussian 
*     In fact, any function that is finite in frequency space will have
*     infinite extent in image space (I think). As such they will all
*     drag in some power from the aliased versions of the map transform
*     and all suffer from edge effects and large compute times. Some are
*     worse than others, however. For example, a Gaussian can have most
*     of its power concentrated over a much smaller footprint than a
*     Bessel function, so the convolution calculation will be much
*     faster. It is also more robust in the presence of spikes and
*     seeing problems because it does not truncate the map FT as sharply
*     as the Bessel function - such effects give rise to smoother
*     defects in the rebinned map though the defects will still BE
*     there.
