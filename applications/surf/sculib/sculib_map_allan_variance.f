*  Name:
*     SCULIB_MAP_ALLAN_VARIANCE

*  Purpose:
*     incorporate latest set of MAP demodulated data 
*     into Allan variance

*  Description:
*     This routine incorporates a data slice into a run of data and
*     updates the Allan variance of the run.
*        The Allan variance is calculated for a range of simulated integration
*     times for which artificial samples are calculated from the input data.
*     The Allan variance for a particular integration time is calculated from:-
*
*        variance =     sum      ( (sample (i) - sample (i+1)) ** 2)
*                   i = 1 to n-1 ( ---------------------------------
*                                (            2 * n
*
*     where n is the number of artificial samples available.
*     


*  Invocation:
*     CALL SCULIB_MAP_ALLAN_VARIANCE (DEMOD, N_BOLS, N_SAMPLES, 
*    :  N_ALLAN_BOL, ALLAN_BOL, KMAX, SUM, N_SUM, ARTIFICIAL, 
*    :  N_ARTIFICIAL, ALLAN_VARIANCE, ALLAN_QUALITY, STATUS)

*  Arguments:
*     DEMOD (4, N_BOLS, N_SAMPLES)    = REAL (Given)

*           at each sample position
*     ALLAN_BOL (N_ALLAN_BOL)         = INTEGER (Given)
*           the positions in the demodulated data array of the bolometers

*           variance
*     KMAX                            = INTEGER (Given)
*           the size of the Allan variance array
*     SUM (KMAX)                      = REAL (Given and returned)
*           the accumulator for current artificial sample of length K real 
*           samples
*     N_SUM (KMAX)                    = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*           the number of samples currently in the artificial sample
*           accumulator
*     ARTIFICIAL (KMAX)               = REAL (Given and returned)
*           the last artificial sample of length K samples that was
*           calculated
*     N_ARTIFICIAL (KMAX)             = INTEGER (Given and returned) 
*           the number of artificial samples of length K samples that

*     STATUS                          = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*           global status

*  Method:
*     If status on entry is good the routine will:-
*
*     loop through the data samples to be incorporated -
*
*        loop through the bolometers whose data is to be averaged into
*        this sample -
*
*           if the bolometer was measured -
*              if the measurement had good quality -
*
*                 add the measurement to the average for this sample
*
*              end if
*           end if
*
*        end of loop
*
*        if any bolometers had good data for this sample -
*
*           calculate the sample average
*
*           loop through the Allan variances -
*
*              add the sample to the buffer used to calculate the latest
*              artificial sample at the simulated integration time of this
*              variance
*
*              if all the data has been obtained for the latest artificial 
*              sample -
*
*                 calculate the artificial sample
*
*                 if there is only one artificial sample for this simulated
*                 integration time we can't calculate the Allan variance, so
*                 set its quality to bad
*
*                 if there are 2 artifical samples then the Allan variance
*                 can be calculated from -
*
*                    variance = (artifical_2 - artifical_1) ** 2
*                               --------------------------------
*                                       2 * 2
*
*                 if there are more than 2 artificial samples 
*
*                    the sum of the squares of the differences between the 
*                    previous samples is recovered from the current value of the
*                    Allan variance
*
*                    the square of the difference between the current artificial
*                    sample and the previous one is added to the sum
*
*                    the Allan variance is re-calculated 
*
*                 end if
*
*                 the current artifical sample is stored to be used as the
*                 `previous' sample next time round
*
*                 the variables used to calculate the artificial samples at
*                 this simulated integration time are reset
*
*              end if
*
*           end of loop through Allan variances
*
*        end if
*
*     end of loop through samples in this dataslice
