      SUBROUTINE SCULIB_SUB_TAUZ (N_SUBS, SUB_FILTER, N_SKY, SKY_FILTER,
     :  SKY_TAUZ, SKY_DAY, SUB_TAUZ, SUB_DAY, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     SCULIB_SUB_TAUZ

*  Purpose:
*     get tauz appropriate for each sub-instrument

*  Description:
*     This routine finds the zenith sky optical depth appropriate for the
*     filter in front of each sub-instrument being used. If it cannot find 
*     an optical depth for the required filter the routine will output a 
*     warning message and return an optical depth of 0.0.
*
*     The times and dates at which the optical depths were measured are also 
*     returned. If the optical depth for the required filter cannot be found
*     then the date will be that at which the routine is run.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SCULIB_GET_TAUZ (N_SUBS, SUB_FILTER, N_SKY, SKY_FILTER,
*    :  SKY_TAUZ, SKY_DAY, SUB_TAUZ, SUB_DAY, STATUS)

*           number of filters for which data is available
*     SKY_FILTER (N_SKY)             = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*           filters for which data is available

*     SKY_DAY (N_SKY)                = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*           the date and time of the tauz measurement specified as day 
*           number since 1st Jan.
*     SUB_TAUZ (N_SUBS)              = REAL (Returned)
*           tauz appropriate to sub-instruments
*     SUB_DAY (N_SUBS)               = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*           the date and time of the tauz measurement
*     STATUS                         = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*           global status
