*  Name:
*     SCULIB_WTFN_REGRID_3

*  Purpose:
*     Sets up the 'guard ring' of bolometers outside the data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SCULIB_WTFN_REGRID_3 (METHOD,RES,PIXSPACE, NI, NJ, ICEN, JCEN, 
*    :  TOT_WEIGHT_IN, WAVELENGTH, CONV_DATA_SUM, CONV_VARIANCE_SUM, 
*    :  CONV_QUALITY_SUM, CONV_WEIGHT, WEIGHTSIZE, SCLSZ, WTFN, STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Takes the regridded image and adds in data of value 'zero'
*     for any points that are within range of the weighting function
*     (ie if TOTAL_WEIGHT is greater than 0) but that do not already
*     contain any data (ie TOTAL_WEIGHT is set to something becuase
*     regrid_1 determined that the pixel was close enough to be
*     influenced by the convolution function, BUT no data was actually
*     found to lie in that pixel). This has the effect of enforcing
*     zero flux density at the edges of the map or where no data
*     was present (eg surrounding a bad pixel).
*     This is only really necessary for the bessel function regrid since
*     that function is extremely sensitive to edge effects.
*     Once the 'guard ring' has been processed, the output image is
*     normalised by dividing by the convolution weight (ie the actual
*     weight used for each pixel). Any point that has zero convolution
*     weight is set to bad.
