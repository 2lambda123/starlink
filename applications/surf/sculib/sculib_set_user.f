      SUBROUTINE SCULIB_SET_USER (J_TEL, J_ATM, N_MEASUREMENTS,
     :  AIRMASS, J_MEAS_D, J_MEAS_V, USER)
*+
*  Name:
*     SCULIB_SET_USER

*  Purpose:
*     set the USER array used by SCULIB_SKYFUNC_1

*  Description:
*     E04UPF is a NAG routine that is used to fit a theoretical
*     sky-dip curve to the measured data by varying ETA_TEL, B and TAU.
*     SCULIB_SKYFUNC_1 is called by E04UPF to calculate the M sub-functions
*     fi(x) at the current solution vector X, and/or their Jacobian
*     matrix (see NAG manual for further info). That routine obtains the
*     data needed for its calculations via the USER array passed into it,
*     and this routine fills USER with the necessary numbers:-
*      - USER (1) = J_TEL
*      - USER (2) = J_ATM
*      - USER (3) = not used
*      - USER (4:M+3)      = the measured airmasses 
*      - USER (M+4:2M+3)   = the measured sky temperatures 
*      - USER (2M+4:3M+3)  = the errors on the measured sky temperatures


*  Invocation:
*     CALL SCULIB_SET_USER (J_TEL, J_ATM, N_MEASUREMENTS,
*    :  AIRMASS, J_MEAS_D, J_MEAS_V, USER)

*  Arguments:
*     J_TEL                     = REAL (Given)
*             the temperature of the telescope
*     J_ATM                     = REAL (Given)
*             the temperature of the atmosphere
*     N_MEASUREMENTS            = INTEGER (Given)
*             the number of measurements taken in the sky-dip
*     AIRMASS (N_MEASUREMENTS)  = REAL (Given)
*             the airmass at each measurement
*     J_MEAS_D (N_MEASUREMENTS) = REAL (Given)
*             the brightness temperature of the atmosphere at each airmass
*     J_MEAS_V (N_MEASUREMENTS) = REAL (Given)
*             the variance on J_MEAS_D
*     USER (3 * N_MEASUREMENTS + 3) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*             the USER array required
