     :     I, J, STATUS)
*+
*  Name:
*     SURFLIB_CALC_GRIDIJ

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate the position of a pixel number in an IJ grid

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:

*  Description:
*     Calculates the I,J grid positions related to pixel numbers 
*     1 to NX*NY.
*     Must calculate all positions in one go since it is very inefficient
*     to calculate the spiral positions on demand
*     Three modes types are currently available.

*  Arguments:
*     TYPE = CHAR (Given)
*       Type of unwrapping. Can be one of:
*       XLINEAR - unfold each X strip in turn for each Y
*       YLINEAR - unfold each Y strip in turn for each X
*       SPIRAL - unfold in a spiral from the reference pixels (ICEN,JCEN)
*       DIAG1  - Diagonal starting at 1,1
*       DIAG2  - Diagonal starting at NX,1
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*       Number of pixels in X
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*       Number of pixels in Y
*     ICEN = INTEGER (Given)
*       Location of reference pixel in X
*     JCEN = INTEGER (Given)
*       Location of reference pixel in Y
*     I ( NX * NY ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*       X Positions in grid, indexed by pixel number
*     J ( NX * NY ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*       Y Positions in grid, indexed by pixel number
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*       Global Status
