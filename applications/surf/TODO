SURF TODO list
--------------

 - Fix problem with SCUBA2MEM output writing FITS headers after the
   END flag.
                          [DONE 22 MAY 2000]

 - Fix skydips so that they 'know' the correct T_COLD and T_HOT
                          [DONE]

 - Fix skydips so that they know correct ETA_TEL
       [DONE 22-MAY-2000]

 - Check that FIRST_LST is less than SECOND_LST in EXTINCTION.
   If not, add 24h
	[DONE 22 MAY 2000]

 - Fix SCUBA2MEM for NA chops

 - Add 'OUTER' to REMSKY so that I dont need to know how
   many 
           [ DONE with negative ring numbers 22 MAY 2000]


 - Add some of Dave Hughes' BOLOCAM patches

- Remove CHOP FITS keywords from REMDBM output
    [DONE MAY 23 2000]

- Remove sculib_linux.c
    [DONE]

- Add copyright messages to all files.
    [DONE]

- Possiblly squeeze in JFL's CALCSKY patch
    [DONE]

- Fix division-by-zero when calculating variances of
  the IP correction
    [DONE]

- SCULIB_CALC_APPARENT assumes LAT_OBS
    [DONE]

- Add SFACTOR parameter to documentation of *REBIN
   [DONE - 11-May-00]

  Add SFACTOR parameter to IFL files for INT/BOLREBIN
   [DONE]

- Add note to docs to explciitly state that REMSKY averages over
  1 second for JIGGLE and 0.125 for SCAN -- after confusion over
  how long a 'jiggle' is.

- Aborted data files (eg those with headers but less than a full exposure)
  Should die gracefully in REDUCE_SWITCH rather than complaining
  that the bounds are less than 1 for the second dim. (since EXP_POINTER
  is one and EXP_POINTER-1 is 0)
    [DONE]

- Add note to documentation to point out that zero level in scan maps
  is suspect.

- Fix Units propogation in REBIN - always uses volts. Simply want to
  read the units from the input files and store them in the FITS
  header or something.
    [DONE]

-2. Make sure that VEC_?TO+ have the BAD flag set to TRUE
    so that bad values are converted correctly when changing
    variable type (eg SCUOVER and SCUBA2MEM)
    [DONE - 2003-04-01]

-1. SURFLIB_CALC_OUTPUT_GRID returns error message saying >1000
   instead of 4096
     [DONE]

0. Does cmp_getvr work in NDF perl module?
   Got error about type from get_mortalspace.
     [SEEMS TO WORK NOW - 26-JUN-2000]

1. Sculog to support SCUBA_PREFIX


3. Allow DESPIKE to interpolate rather than mark bad.


6. Change SCUOVER to PGPLOT and extract into a separate monolith.
     - difficult to remove SGS without dropping the KAPPA 
       routines (which contain a couple of SGS calls)
       Essentially the colour index code is the problem.
       Other than that SGS could be removed from surf_scuover.f
       without too much trouble.
     [DONE - June 2, 2000]


7. SCUPA does not support numeric input (SCUBA_PREFIX)

10. Update SCULIB_SKYDIP_TEMPERATURES so that it uses DOUBLE. 
    This will prevent negative variance. [Note that this is
    an ON-LINE issue as well]

12. A utility to list the contents of DEM_PNTR in a meaningful way
    to make life easier when despiking scan maps.


16. Fix SCUSHIFT so that it modified PHOT_BB for photom data.

17. Fix the 2 and 3 bolometer chopping data reduction to remove
    the off-off part.

18. Propogate switches through SURF....


20. SCULIB_CALC_BOL_COORDS should deal with all the offsetting
    issues.



24 Do threshold clipping for individual bolometers (rather than clipping based on 
   STATS)


26. Change pointsum so that it doesn't show Uaz,Uel for DEM files.


DONE
====

4. Propogate HISTORY to REBIN output when only regridding one file. 


21  SCULOG sometimes prints a HST time in the wrong format


25. Generate stats on each bolometer in turn.
     (shell script)


- surf_write_map_info does not check status on entry,


15. Don't do third regrid phase for LINEAR rebin [optional]


19. Despike will not run unhindered if it attempts to write out
    more than one output file. Need a way of always accepting the
    default output file.


-4 Allow configurable footprint size for REBIN

-3. Make REMDBM use filenames related to process id to stop it
    from clashing with junk.sdf....



4. Propogate HISTORY to SCUPHOT output.


23 Allow the ability to specify map sizes in REBIN


2. Make the creation of the WEIGHTS array optional. (REBIN)


1. Generate default output name from input name.
     - use $SCUBA_SUFFIX env variable to determine whether default
       is long or short (ie des_res_flat_ext_long vs _drfel)

9. Change 'DUMMY' parameter messages since they can appear in 
   PROMPT mode.

14. Propogate AXIS through SCAN_RLB and DESPIKE

16. Make sure sdip uses COSYS=DATA

17. Despike:  Print message saying how many spikes were removed
    from each bolometer. Tidy up logic in simple despike.
    [ie Do I reset bit 5? Do I clip points with bad quality?]

17. REMSKY can not accept more than 20 bolometers. Need to add 
    groups (such as RING1, ALL, RING2, ALL except H7)

8. Error in SCULIB_PUT_FITS_C - string can be missing '/'
    [ON-line]
   Error in SCULIB_PUT_FITS_I - No space between number and '='
    [Also R and C]

16. SCULIB_CONSTRUCT_OUT should do something if input filename
    equals output filename.

13. Check MAP_X and MAP_Y (especially when combining data with different
    MAP_X and MAP_Y) Checked for RB offsets.


9. Change 'DUMMY' parameter messages since they can appear in 
   PROMPT mode - only need to do for the surf.ifl file
