# Script to set the startup environment variables for SURF

#  Full Starlink prologue is at the end

#  Current UTdate is the default
#
#  This script is designed for use at the JAC (since only at
#  the JAC do I know the location of the data directory)


# Check to see if $1 has been used (ie if an argument has been
# supplied)

# Now set DATADIR - this depends on our location
# There are 3 possibilities. We are in Hilo, we are at the JCMT
# or we are somewhere else. 
#
#
# At the JCMT we need to set DATADIR to /jcmtarchive/UTdate
# In this case the current UT date is the sensible choice
# 
# In Hilo we need to set DATADIR to /scuba/Semester/UTdate/
# In this case current UT is meaningless and an argument should be
# used
#
# Somewhere else - we have no idea where DATADIR should be
# so we do nothing

*  Name:
*    SCUSETENV
*
*  Purpose:
*    Set the startup environment variables for SURF
*
*  Type of Module:
*    C-shell script
*
*  Usage:
*    scusetenv [UTdate]
*
*  Description:
*    This script sets the standard DATADIR and SCUBA_PREFIX
*    environment variables given a UT date.

*  Parameters:
*    UTdate = YYYYMMDD format string (Optional)
*      The UT date of the data to be processed (in YYYYMMDD format).
*      The default value is to use the current UT date

*  Examples:
*    scusetenv
*      Set DATADIR and SCUBA_PREFIX for the current UT date
*    scusetenv 19980201
*      Set DATADIR and SCUBA_PREFIX for the data observed on date
*      19980201

*  Notes:
*    - Currently this routine only works for the JAC and JCMT systems.
*      This is because the data are stored in standard
*      directories and indexed by YYYYMMDD UT date.
*    - ORAC_DATA_IN environment variable is also set (only relevant
*      for users of the ORAC-DR pipeline)
*    - If this routine is run from a non-JAC/JCMT site DATADIR
*      will not be set but SCUBA_PREFIX will be set.

*  Implementation Status:
*    This script should be sourced (not executed) since the 
*    environment variables should be set after the script has been read.
