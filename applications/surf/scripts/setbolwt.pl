Description:
  This routine sets the bolometer weights.
  It can do this in two ways:

  1. Calculate the statistics for each bolometer then generate the
     weights relative to the central pixel. Should not be used when
     a strong source is present.

  2. Read the weights from a text file using the -wtfile option.    

  Writes to the BOLWT extension. This extension is then read by REBIN.

  Multiple files can be referenced to the first file by specifying 
  multiple files on the command line or by using a REBIN-style input
  file and the -filelist option. In conjunction with the -wtfile option
  all input files are given the same weights.

Usage:
  setbolwt [-h] [-wtfile=] [-filelist=] filename <filename2> <filename3>
Options:
   -h[elp]\t This message
   -filelist=s\t An ASCII text file containing a list of files
   -wtfile=s\t An ASCII text file containing the weights

  The input filename must have been extinction corrected (since currently
  the EXTINCTION task will not know that it should split the BOLWT 
  extension).

  Multiple filenames can be read from the command line
   e.g. *_lon_ext.sdf

  If the filelist option is used the input file must be of the 
  same format as allowed for REBIN and DESPIKE (ie can in fact just
  be a list of input files (one file per line) but can include comments
  and map shifts)

  When multiple files are read in all the bolometer weights are calculated 
  relative to the central pixel of the first map.

  Currently no check is performed to make sure that bolometers from 
  the same array are being compared.

*+
*  Name:
*    SETBOLWT
 
*  Purpose:
*    Calculate or set bolometer weights
 
*  Language:
*    Perl 5
 
*  Description:
*    This routine sets the bolometer weights.
*    It can do this in two ways:
*
*     1. Calculate the statistics for each bolometer then generate the
*        weights relative to the central pixel. Should not be used when
*        a strong source is present. The weights are calculated by
*        using Kappa STATS to calculate the standard deviation of
*        each bolometer in turn. The weight is defined as the relative
*        variance between this bolometer and the reference bolometer.
*
*     2. Read the weights from a text file using the -wtfile option.    
*
*    Writes to the BOLWT extension. This extension is then read by REBIN.
*
*    Multiple files can be referenced to the first file by specifying 
*    multiple files on the command line or by using a REBIN-style input
*    file and the -filelist option. In conjunction with the -wtfile option
*    all input files are given the same weights.

*  Usage:
*    setbolwt [-h] [-wtfile=] [-filelist=] filenames...

*  ADAM Parameters:
*    -h
*      Return a usage message.
*    -wtfile=file
*      An ASCII text file containing the weights, one weight per line
*      corresponding to the order of bolometers stored in the file.
*    -filelist=file
*      An ASCII text file containing a list of files to be processed.
*      There must be one file per line and it must be in a form
*      acceptable to REBIN (ie comments can be included).
*    filenames
*      List of filenames to be processed. Wild cards can be used.
*      eg *_lon_ext.sdf.

*  Examples:
*    setbolwt 
*      The user will be prompted for a list of input NDFs. The weights
*      will be calculated by setbolwt.
*    setbolwt -wtfile=weights.dat file1
*      Set the weights in file1.sdf from the list contained in
*      weights.dat
*    setbolwt file1 file2 file3 file4
*      Calculate the weights of each bolometer in all four files
*      relative to the central pixel in file1.sdf.
*    setbolwt -wtfile=wt.dat -filelist=rebin.inp
*      Set the weights of the files listed in rebin.inp to those
*      stored in wt.dat (same weights for each file).

*  Notes:
*    - Input files must have been extinction corrected so that only
*      one sub-instrument is present per file.
*    - When multiple files are used bolometers are compared to the
*      central bolometer of the first file.
*    - If source signal is present in any bolometer at a level
*      significantly above the noise, the automatic weighting will
*      be skewed (in fact the bolometer with the source signal will
*      be down-weighted relative to all the others since the standard
*      deviation on the bolometer will be much higher.). The weights
*      must be set via an external file in this case.
