Description:
\tThis program should be used to reduce SCAN-MAP data taken
\tusing the technique described by Emerson 
\t(1995, ASP Conf Ser 75, 309). The following is assumed by the
\tprogram:
\t\t1. Each chop configuration has been regridded independently
\t\t   using the SURF task REBIN. (so that the FITS header
\t\t   can be read).
\t\t2. Each image must have identical dimensions and pixel size
\t\t   (they need not be square or a power of 2)
\t\t3. The images must be rebinned in the same coordinate
\t\t   as the chop throw. (RJ for RB and GA, PL for moving objects)
\tCurrently compliance to the above is only assumed.

}

=item configure

This method is used to configure the object. It is invoked
automatically if the new() method is invoked with an argument. The
file(), raw(), readhdr(), header(), group() and recipe() methods are
invoked by this command. Arguments are not required.

The sub-instrument configuration is also stored.

=cut

sub configure {
  my $self = shift;
 
  my $fname = shift;

  # Set the filename
  $self->file($fname);
 
  # Set the raw data file name
  $self->raw($fname);
 
  # Populate the header
  $self->header($self->readhdr);
 
  # Find the group name and set it
#  $self->group($self->findgroup);
 
  # Find the recipe name
#  $self->recipe($self->findrecipe);
 
  # Find number of sub-instruments from header
  # and store this value along with all sub-instrument info.
  # Do this so that the header can be changed without us
  # losing the original state information
#  $self->nsubs($self->findnsubs);
#  $self->subs($self->findsubs);
#  $self->filters($self->findfilters);
#  $self->wavelengths($self->findwavelengths);

  # Return something
  return 1;
}



=item readhdr

Reads the header from the observation file (the filename is stored
in the object). The reference to the header hash is returned.
This method does not set the header in the object (in general that
is done by configure() ).

    $hashref = $Obj->readhdr;

If there is an error during the read a reference to an empty hash is 
returned.

Currently this method assumes that the reduced group is stored in
NDF format. Only the FITS header is retrieved from the NDF.

There are no input arguments.

=cut

sub readhdr {
 
  my $self = shift;
  
  # Just read the NDF fits header
  my ($ref, $status) = fits_read_header($self->file);
 
  # Return an empty hash if bad status
  $ref = {} if ($status != &NDF::SAI__OK);
 
  return $ref;
}


=item findgroup

Return the group associated with the Frame. 
This group is constructed from header information.

For remdbm - they should all be in the group so return a constant.

=cut

# Supply a new method for finding a group


sub findgroup {

  my $self = shift;

  # construct group name
  my $group = 'REMDBM';
 
  return $group;

}


=item inout

Method to return the current input filename and the 
new output filename given a suffix and a sub-instrument
number.
Currently the suffix is simply appended to the input.

Returns $in and $out in an array context:

  ($in, $out) = $Obs->inout($suffix, $num);

The second argument indicates the sub-instrument number
and is optional (defaults to first sub-instrument).
If only one file is present then that is used as $infile.
(handled by the file() method.)

=cut

sub inout {
  my $num;

  my $self = shift;

  my $suffix = shift;

  # Find the sub-instrument
  if (@_) { 
    $num = shift;
  } else {
    $num = 1;
  }

  my $infile = $self->file($num);
  my $outfile = $infile . $suffix;

  return ($infile, $outfile);

=item findnsubs

Forces the object to determine the number of sub-instruments
associated with the data by looking in the header(). 
The result can be stored in the object using nsubs().

Unlike findgroup() this method will always search the header for

=head1 PRIVATE METHODS

The following methods are intended for use inside the module.
They are included here so that authors of derived classes are 
aware of them.

=over 4

=item stripfname

Method to strip file extensions from the filename string. This method
is called by the file() method. For UKIRT we strip all extensions of the
form ".sdf", ".sdf.gz" and ".sdf.Z" since Starlink tasks do not require
the extension when accessing the file name.

=cut

sub stripfname {
 
  my $self = shift;
 
  my $name = shift;
 
  # Strip everything after the first dot
  $name =~ s/\.(sdf)(\.gz|\.Z)?$//;
  
  return $name;
}


# Setup the object structure



# Create some methods to access "instance" data
#
# With args they set the values
# Without args they only retrieve values


# Method to return/set the filename of the raw data
# Initially this is the same as {File}


=item raw

This method returns (or sets) the name of the raw data file
associated with this object.

  $Obs->raw("raw_data");
  $filename = $Obs->raw;

=cut

sub raw {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{RawName} = shift; }
  return $self->{RawName};
}


# Return/set the current file name of the object
# Make sure that the extension is not present



# Method to return group
# If an argument is supplied the group is set to that value
# If the group is undef then the findgroup method is invoked to set it


=item group

This method returns the group name associated with the observation.
If the object has a value of undef (ie a new object) the findgroup()
method is automatically invoked to determine the group. Subsequent
invocations of the group method will simply return the current value.
The group name can be set explicitly but in general the automatic
lookup should be used.

  $group_name = $Obs->group;
  $Obs->group("group");

=cut


sub group {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{Group} = shift;}

  unless (defined $self->{Group}) {
    $self->findgroup;
  }

  return $self->{Group};
}

# Method to return the recipe name
# If an argument is supplied the recipe is set to that value
# If the recipe is undef then the findrecipe method is invoked to set it


=item recipe

This method returns the recipe name associated with the observation.
If the object has a value of undef (ie a new object) the findrecipe()
method is automatically invoked to determine the recipe. Subsequent
invocations of the method will simply return the current value.
The recipe name can also be set explicitly but in general this behaviour
would be superceded by ORAC::Group objects.

  $recipe_name = $Obs->recipe;
  $Obs->recipe("recipe");

=cut


sub recipe {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{Recipe} = shift;}

  unless (defined $self->{Recipe}) {
    $self->findrecipe;
  }

  return $self->{Recipe};
}

# Method to populate the header with a hash
# Requires a hash reference and returns a hash reference

=item header

Set or retrieve the hash associated with the header information
stored for the observation.

    $Obs->header(\%hdr);
    $hashref = $Obs->header;

This methods takes and returns a reference to a hash.

=cut


sub header {
  my $self = shift;

  if (@_) { 
    my $arg = shift;
    croak("Argument is not a hash") unless ref($arg) eq "HASH";
    $self->{Header} = $arg;
  }


  return $self->{Header};
}


# Supply a method to access individual pieces of header information
# Without forcing the user to access the hash directly

=item hdr

This method allows specific entries in the header to be accessed.
The header must be available (set by the "header" method).
The input argument should correspond to the keyword in the header
hash.

  $tel = $Obs->hdr("TELESCOP");
  $instrument = $Obs->hdr("INSTRUME");

Can also be used to set values in the header.

  $Obs->hdr("INSTRUME", "IRCAM");

=cut

sub hdr {
  my $self = shift;

  my $keyword = shift;

  if (@_) { ${$self->header}{$keyword} = shift; }

  return ${$self->header}{$keyword};
}







# Supply a method to find the recipe name and set it

=item findgroup

Method to determine the recipe name that should be used to reduce
the observation.
The default method is to look for a "RECIPE" entry in the header.

  $recipe = $Obs->findrecipe;

=cut


sub findrecipe {
  my $self = shift;

  # Simplistic routine that simply returns the RECIPE
  # entry in the header

  return $self->hdr('RECIPE');

}


# Supply a method to return the number associated with the observation

=item number

Method to return the number of the observation. The number is
determined by looking for a number at the end of the raw data
filename.  For example a number can be extracted from strings of the
form textNNNN.sdf or textNNNN, where NNNN is a number (leading zeroes
are stripped) but not textNNNNtext (number must be followed by a decimal
point or nothing at all).

  $number = $Obs->number;

=cut


sub number {

  my $self = shift;

  my ($number);

  # Get the number from the raw data
  # Assume there is a number at the end of the string
  # (since the extension has already been removed)
  # Leading zeroes are dropped

  if ($self->raw =~ /(\d+)(\.\w+)?$/) {
    # Drop leading 00
    $number = $1 * 1;
  } else {
    # No match so set to -1
    $number = -1;
  }

  return $number;

}



=item template

Method to change the current filename of the frame (file())
so that it matches the current template. e.g.:

  $Obs->template("something_number_flat")

Would change the current file to match "something_number_flat".
Essentially this simply means that the number in the template
is changed to the number of the current frame object.

The base method assumes that the filename matches the form:
prefix_number_suffix. This must be modified by the derived
classes since in general the filenaming convention is telescope
and instrument specific.

=cut

sub template {
  my $self = shift;
  my $template = shift;

  my $num = $self->number;
  # Change the first number
  $template =~ s/_\d+_/_${num}_/;

  # Update the filename
  $self->file($template);

}


=item userheader

Set or retrieve a hash containing general purpose information
about the frame. This is distinct from the Frame header
(see header()) that is associated with the FITS header.

    $Obs->userheader(\%hdr);
    $hashref = $Obs->userheader;

This methods takes and returns a reference to a hash.

=cut


sub userheader {
  my $self = shift;

  if (@_) { 
    my $arg = shift;
    croak("Argument is not a hash") unless ref($arg) eq "HASH";
    $self->{UserHeader} = $arg;
  }


  return $self->{UserHeader};
}


=item uhdr

This method allows specific entries in the user specified header to 
be accessed. The header must be available (set by the "userheader" method).
The input argument should correspond to the keyword in the header
hash.

  $info = $Obs->uhdr("INFORMATION");

Can also be used to set values in the header.

  $Obs->uhdr("INFORMATION", "value");

=cut

sub uhdr {
  my $self = shift;

  my $keyword = shift;

  if (@_) { ${$self->userheader}{$keyword} = shift; }

=item load

Initialise the monolith into the object. What this really
does is store the directory of the monolith 
so that it can be run and so that we can determine
which tasks are linked to it.

In reality the second argument is mandatory for this
interface since I have no idea where the monolith
is otherwise.

=item obeyw

Execute an ADAM task via the unix shell.
Return the shell exit status.

  $status = obeyw("task", "arguments");

Full path to "task" is not required since this was setup 
when the object was initialised via load().

Note that currently we have no control over the output
messages. It is conceivable that I could at least
redirect to /dev/null if a flag was set in the 
ControlSH module.

subsequent arguments are the parameter values (in an array
context)

}


=item set

Set a parameter.
Currently not implemented

=cut

sub set {

=item control

Control current working directory and parameter resets.  The type of
control message is specified via the first argument. Allowed values
are:

  default:  Return or set the current working directory
  par_reset: Reset all parameters associated with the monolith.

  ($current, $status) = )$obj->control("type", "value")

"value" is only relevant for the "default" type and is used
to specify a new working directory. $current is always returned
even if it is undefined.

These commands are synonymous with the cwd() and resetpars()
methods.

  } else {
    croak "Unrecognised control type. Should be \'default\' or '\par_reset\'";
  }

=item resetpars

Reset parameter values.
A simplistic version is implemented that tries to remove
parameter files from the current ADAM_USER directory
depending on whether a link exists in the monolith directory.

Do nothing for now!

=cut

sub resetpars {
  my $self = shift;
  
  
  return ORAC__OK;
}


=item contact and contactw

Check that we can contact the monolith.
This method simply makes sure that we know where the monolith
is and that it can be executed. There is no difference between
contactw. and contact(). Returns a '1' if the command can be executed
and '0' if it cannot.

=cut

sub contact {

  return $self->{Obj};
}


=item load

Load a monolith and set up the name in the messaging system.
This task is called by the 'new' method.

  $status = $obj->load("name","monolith_binary");

If the second argument is omitted it is assumed that the binary
is already running and can be called by "name".   

If a path to a binary with name "name" already exists then the monolith
is not loaded.

=item obeyw

Send an obey to a task and wait for a completion message

  $status = $obj->obeyw("action","params");

=cut

sub obeyw {
  my $self = shift;

  my $status;

  # Pass arguments directly to the object
  if (@_) { $status = $self->obj->obeyw(@_); }

  # Should now change status from the obeyw (DTASK__ACTCOMPLETE)
  # to good ORAC status

  if ($status == $main::DTASK__ACTCOMPLETE) {
    $status = ORAC__OK;
  }
  return $status;

}


=item get

Obtain the value of a parameter

 ($status, @values) = $obj->get("task", "param");

Note that this is a different order to that returned by the
Standard ADAM interface and follows the ORAC definition.

=cut

sub get {
  # Check number of arguments
  if (scalar(@_) != 3) { 
    croak 'get: Wrong number of arguments. Usage: $task->get(\'task\', \'param\')';
  }

  # Convert $result to an array
  my @values = ();

  # an array of values if we have a square bracket at the start
  # something and a square bracket at the end 

  if ($result =~ /^\s*\[.*\]\s*$/) {
    # Remove the brackets
    $result =~ s/^\s*\[(.*)]\s*/$1/;
  
    # Now split on comma
    @values = split(/,/, $result);

  } else {
    push(@values, $result);
  }

  # DOUBLE precision values are not handled by perl as numbers
  # We need to change all parameters values of form "numberD+-number"
  # to "numberE+-number"
  # not clear whether I should be doing this in the ADAM module
  # itself or here. For now do it in the ORAC interface

  map { s/(\d)D(\+|-\d)/${1}E$2/g; } @values;

  # Convert from ADAM to ORAC status
  # Probably should put in a subroutine
  if ($status == $main::SAI__OK) {
    $status = ORAC__OK;
  }

  return ($status, @values);
}

=item set

Set the value of a parameter

  $status = $obj->set("task", "param", "newvalue");

=cut

sub set {
  # Check number of arguments
  if (scalar(@_) != 4) { 
    croak 'get: Wrong number of arguments. Usage: $task->set(\'task\', \'param\', \'newvalue\')';
  }

  my $self = shift;

  # Now need to construct the arguments for the AMS layer
  
  my $task = shift;

  # Convert from ADAM to ORAC status
  # Probably should put in a subroutine
  if ($status == $main::SAI__OK) {
    $status = ORAC__OK;
  }

  return $status;
}


=item control

Send CONTROL messages to the monolith. The type of control
message is specified via the first argument. Allowed values are:

  default:  Return or set the current working directory
  par_reset: Reset all parameters associated with the monolith.

  ($current, $status) = )$obj->control("type", "value")

"value" is only relevant for the "default" type and is used
to specify a new working directory. $current is always returned
even if it is undefined.

These commands are synonymous with the cwd() and resetpars()
methods.

=cut

sub control {

  my ($value, $status);
  my $self = shift;
  
  if (@_) { 
    ($value, $status) = $self->obj->control(@_);

    # Convert from ADAM to ORAC status
    # Probably should put in a subroutine
    if ($status == $main::SAI__OK) {
      $status = ORAC__OK;
    }
  }
  return ($value, $status);
}

# Stop the monolith from being killed on exit

sub forget {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->obj->forget;
}

=item resetpars

Reset all parameters associated with a monolith

  $status = $obj->resetpars;

=cut

sub resetpars {
  my $self = shift;

  my ($junk, $status) = $self->obj->control("par_reset");

  # Convert from ADAM to ORAC status
  # Probably should put in a subroutine
  if ($status == $main::SAI__OK) {
    $status = ORAC__OK;
  }

  return $status;

}


=item cwd

Set and retrieve the current working directory of the monolith

  ($cwd, $status) = $obj->cwd("newdir");

=cut

sub cwd {
  my $self = shift;
  my $newdir = shift;

  my ($value, $status) = $self->obj->control("default", $newdir);

  # Convert from ADAM to ORAC status
  # Probably should put in a subroutine
  if ($status == $main::SAI__OK) {
    $status = ORAC__OK;
  }
  return $status;

}


=item contactw

This method will not return unless the monolith can be contacted.
It only returns with a timeout. Returns a '1' if we contacted okay
and a '0' if we timed out. It will timeout if it takes longer than
specified in ORAC::Msg::ADAM::Control->timeout.

=cut


sub contactw {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->obj->contactw;
}


=item contact

This method can be used to determine whether the object can
contact a monolith. Returns a 1 if we can contact a monolith and
a zero if we cant.

=cut

sub contact {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->obj->contact;
}

*+
*  Name:
*    REMDBM
 
*  Purpose:
*    Remove dual beam signature from scan maps
 
*  Language:
*    Perl 5
 
*  Description:
*    This program should be used to reduce SCAN-MAP data taken
*    using the technique described by Emerson (1995, ASP Conf Ser 75, 309).
*    The deconvolution is performed using Fast Fourier techniques.

*  Usage:
*    remdbm [-h] [-v] [-out=] files

*  ADAM Parameters:
*    -h
*      Help message
*    -v
*      Version number. Also indicates whether ADAM communication is
*      enabled.
*    -out=file
*      Filename of output image. Default is 'final.sdf'
*    -filter
*      Filter out frequencies higher than can be detected by the telescope.
*    files
*      List of input files to be processed. Shell wildcards are allowed.
*      See notes for restrictions.

*  Examples:
*    remdbm *_reb.sdf
*      Process all files matching the pattern.
*    remdbm -out=m82 o66_lon_reb o67_lon_reb o68_lon_reb o69_lon_reb
*      Process the four input images. The output filename is set to
*      m82.sdf.

*  Notes:
*    The following restrictions apply:
*    - Each image should contain a single chop configuration.
*    - Each image must have identical dimensions and pixel size
*      (they do not need to be square)
*    - The images must be rebinned in the same coordinate system
*      as the chop throw.
