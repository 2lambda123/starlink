#  Name:
#      dream2surf_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against SURF.

#  Type of Module:
#     Bourne-shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script lists the linking qualifiers for the non-SURF
#     libraries used by SURF.  It should be invoked by those building
#     SURF or other applications which use SURF libraries in order to
#     generate the correct arguments for the compiler (or ld) command.
#     The arguments generated are written to the standard output.

#     The script contains an awk script to remove duplicate references
#     that result from other linker `options' files.  The file is
#     needed because there would be too many references before the awk
#     script could reduce them.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a makefile command to
#     create a monolith in Starlink standard makefiles, thus:
#
#         $(ALINK) $(MONO_OBJECT) -o $(MONOLITH) `surf_libs` \
#             -L$(STAR_LIB) `./surf_link_adam`
