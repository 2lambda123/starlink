*+
*  Name:
*     DESPIKE2

*  Purpose:
*     Remove spikes from SCAN/MAP observations

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL SURF_DESPIKE( STATUS )
 
*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status
 
*  Description:
*     This routine removes spikes from SCAN/MAP observations.
*     The scan map differential despiking algorithm uses 2 criteria
*     to decide which points are spikes.
*
*     First, for each bolometer used a pass is made through each
*     scan calculating for each point:-
*
*       diff(i) = point(i) - (point(i-1) + point(i+1))
*                            -------------------------
*                                       2.0 
*
*
*     Values of 'diff' for the first and last points in the scan are
*     calculated in a similar way but subtracting the mean of points
*     2 and 3 and points n-1 and n-2 respectively.
*
*     The mean and standard deviation of 'diff' are calculated by
*     coadding the 10 points at each end of the scan where,
*     hopefully, there is no source emission. Spikes in these
*     regions are handled by removing points from the coadd that lie
*     further than 3 sigma from the mean, then redoing the
*     calculation recursively until no further points need be
*     removed.
*
*     The first criterion for a spike is that it's 'diff' value
*     should be further from the mean of 'diff' by NSIGMA times the
*     sigma derived from the endpoints.
*     
*     The problem with this simple approach is that bright sources
*     in the scan themselves lead to excursions in 'diff' that can
*     be wrongly identified as spikes. To prevent this happening a
*     second criterion is used. In this the scan values are
*     convolved with a 3 sample wide box so that each 'box' point is
*     the average of the point itself and the points on either side of
*     it. 'Box' is expected to increase faster for real sources than
*     for spikes because in them the increase will be spread over
*     all 3 averaged points rather than just 1.
* 
*     The second criterion for a spike is met, therefore, if a
*     point's 'diff' is further from the 'diff' mean than the value
*     of 'box' at that point.
*
*     Fixed-up values for points that have identified as spikes are
*     calculated by interpolating between the closest healthy points
*     on either side.
*
*     The second spike criterion also means unfortunately that the
*     technique is less sensitive to spikes on bright sources than
*     elsewhere. In addition, it is still possible to clip bright
*     sources if too low a value for NSIGMA is used. It is
*     recommended to run despike several times with different values
*     of NSIGMA. Begin with NSIGMA=5, look at the result to see how
*     effective despiking has been, then repeat the process with
*     NSIGMA=4.5, 4.0 etc. until you start to clip source
*     information.



*  Usage:
*     restore in out nsigma

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The name of the input file containing demodulated SCUBA data.
*     MSG_FILTER = CHAR (Read)
*        Message filter level. Default is NORM. In verbose mode the location
*        of each spike is reported.
*     NSIGMA = REAL (Read)
*        Nsigma from mean at which 'spikes' begin.
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The name of the output file to contain the processed data.
*        A default output name is suggested that is derived from the
*        input.

*  Examples:
*     restore o37 o37_des 5.0
*       Despike o37.sdf at 5.0 sigma.
*     restore o37 \
*       Despike using the default sigma level and writing to the
*       default output file.

*  Notes:
*     - Care must be taken when despiking bright sources.
*     - If there are 3 spikes in a row and the middle spike is approximately
*       the mean of the spikes either side, the middle spike will not be
*       treated as a spike (and will not be changed)
