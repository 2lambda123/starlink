*  Name:
*     DCV_EXT

*  Purpose:
*     External function definitions for data type inter-conversion

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     INCLUDE 'DCV_EXT'

*  Description:
*     This INCLUDE file contains the type definitions of external
*     functions of type DCV_<T1>TO<T2>, which may be used for
*     converting from one data type into another. The functions
*     themselves are found in the library LIBDIR:DCV.OLB.
*
*     These external functions are the ones which cannot be
*     defined using in-line statement functions in DCV.FUN
*
*     The following conversions are defined here :-
*
*     Function name          Conversion
*     -------------          ----------
*     DCV_BTOUB              BYTE to UNSIGNED BYTE
*     DCV_DTOUB              DOUBLE PRECISION to UNSIGNED BYTE
*     DCV_ITOUB              INTEGER to UNSIGNED BYTE
*     DCV_RTOUB              REAL to UNSIGNED BYTE
*     DCV_WTOUB              WORD to UNSIGNED BYTE
*     DCV_UWTOUB             UNSIGNED WORD to UNSIGNED BYTE
*     DCV_BTOUW              BYTE to UNSIGNED WORD
*     DCV_UBTOUW             UNSIGNED BYTE to UNSIGNED WORD
*     DCV_DTOUW              DOUBLE PRECISION to UNSIGNED WORD
*     DCV_ITOUW              INTEGER to UNSIGNED WORD
*     DCV_RTOUW              REAL to UNSIGNED WORD
*     DCV_WTOUW              WORD to UNSIGNED WORD
*

*  Notes:
*     -  DCV_ can only be used for NUMERIC conversions.
*        The CHR_ library contains routines for conversion to and from
*        CHARACTER and numeric data types.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     -  REAL*16 and COMPLEX types are not included here, but may be
*        added if required.

*  Machine-specific features used:
*     -  The use of BYTE and INTEGER*2 is not portable.
