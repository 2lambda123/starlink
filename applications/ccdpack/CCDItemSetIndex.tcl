#  Name:
#     CCDItemSetIndex

#  Purpose:
#     Read/write annotation of an NDF name in a listbox.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Description:
#     This routine operates on one entry in the setted or unsetted NDFs
#     Ccd::scrollbox widget; it reads the name and its annotation and
#     optionally writes a new annotation.
#
#     The annotation can assume one of three values: it may be the
#     empty string to indicate that no Set Index has been yet selected
#     for the NDF in question; it may be an integer giving the Set Index
#     to be assigned; or it may take the literal value "SET" to indicate
#     that the record is a header indicating the start of a Set (this
#     last case is only possible for the setted list, not the unsetted
#     one).

#  Arguments:
#     Listbox = string
#        Command name of the Ccd::scrollbox widget listing the NDFs.
#     index = string
#        The index within Listbox of the item to be modified.
#     value = string
#        Should be an integer, the empty string, or "SET" if present;
#        gives the Set Index value with which the name will be annotated.
#        If absent, the value will not be modified.

#  Return Value:
#     A two-element list is returned giving the existing annotation and
#     the name.  The existing annotation should be either an integer,
#     the empty string, or the literal "SET".
