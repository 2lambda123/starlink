#  Name:
#     CCDContextHelp

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Purpose:
#     Provides access to Meta-widgets context sensitive help.

#  Description:
#     This routine should be used to trap context sensitive help
#     bindings (such as F1 and Help keypresses). It uses the position
#     information associated with the binding to findout the name of
#     the widget that the mouse pointer is over. It then traverses the
#     tree of widgets until it encounters a widget with class Ccd_
#     (this is the prefix given to all Meta widget classes). It then
#     queries this Meta-widget for the name of the document and label
#     to use as help. It passes these to the appropriate procedures
#     for expansion into a full file name and requests that the help
#     is shown in a browser.

#  Arguments:
#     X = number (read)
#        X position of the mouse pointer when help event occurred
#        (the binding %X value). 
#     Y = number (read)
#        Y position of the mouse pointer when help event occurred
#        (the binding %Y value).
