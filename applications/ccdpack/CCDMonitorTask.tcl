   proc CCDMonitorTask { Textwindow watch task output } {
#+
#  Name:
#     CCDMonitorTask

#  Purpose:
#     Monitors the progress (output) of a task.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     This routine monitors the text returned from a task running in
#     the background. If it detects the presence of the string "!!"
#     then it assumes that an error has occurred and reports this fact.
#     If the global variable CCDseetasks is true then it attempts to
#     write all non-error output to a text-like widget $textwindow.
#
#     If watch is set true then the output is scanned for the string
#     (Number n of m), if located then n and m are used to modify the
#     value of the global variable TASK($task,progress) as a percentage.

#  Arguments:
#     Textwindow = window (write)
#        Command name of a text-like widget for writing the task output to.
#     watch = boolean (read)
#        If watch is set true then the task output is monitored for
#        progress statements. These are used to reflect the relative
#        scaling of a scale widget.
#     task = string (read)
#        Name of the task that is running. Used to store errors.
#     output = string (read)
#        The output of the task.

#  Global Variables:
#     CCDseetasks = boolean (read)
#        If true then the output from the task is echoed into a window.
#     TASK = array (write)
#        All the output from the task is written into the element
#        ($task,output). This is for use when parsing is required (to
#        extract values etc.). Before starting a new task this element
#        should be cleared. The element ($task,progress) is set to the
#        percentage of the task completed, if watch is true.

#  History:
#     15-MAR-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Added header.
#     2-AUG-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Converted for use with the tcl ADAM extensions (instead of BLT).
#     21-AUG-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Added storage of output to TASK(task,output).
#     30-AUG-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Added watch argument to allow progress feedback in a scale
#        type widget.
#     16-MAY-2000 (MBT):
#        Upgraded for Tcl8.
#     3-JUL-2001 (MBT):
#        Improved error reporting - now reports all lines of error message
#        to stdout, which is helpful if a bit messy.  Also removed an
#        error reporting bug I introduced in the last change.
