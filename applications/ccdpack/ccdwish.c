*  Name:
*     ccdwish

*  Purpose:
*     Main routines for ccdwish shell.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Description:
*     This source file contains the main() routine for the ccdwish shell.
*     Ccdwish may be invoked in one of two ways: normally, it will run
*     as a free-standing wish shell, like a normal Tcl wish but with
*     the various extensions added by the CCDPACK system, including
*     the startcl extensions and the ndf object manipulation extensions.
*
*     However, when invoked with the -pipes flag as the first command-
*     line argument, and the subsequent two arguments giving file
*     descriptors for input and output streams, it will run in pipes mode.
*
*     In this mode a Tcl interpreter is set up, and the executable goes
*     into an infinite loop, reading commands from the incoming (downward)
*     pipe, feeding them to the interpreter, and spitting the results
*     back through the output (upward) pipe.
*
*     Each incoming command must be terminated by a '\0' character.
*     Once it has been received, it is fed to the Tcl interpreter and
*     executed.  The Tcl exit status is then written to the upwards pipe
*     (as sizeof( int ) consecutive bytes), followed by a string giving
*     the result of the command, terminated by a '\0' character.
*     If the command was successful, this string will be the
*     interpreter result string; however, if the command returned a
*     TCL_ERROR status then the contents of the errorInfo variable
*     will be given (this is the same as the result, but has the
*     stack trace appended to it).
*     The routine then starts listening again.  The correct way to
*     terminate this process is by sending a Tcl 'exit' command down
*     the pipe.
*
*     This -pipes mode of running is only likely to be useful when the
*     interpreter is running as an exec'd child process.

*  Usage:
*     ccdwish [-pipes ifd ofd]

/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ccdEndinterp

*  Purpose:
*     Asynchronous event handler for Tcl interpreter process.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Description:
*     This routine should be registered as the asynchronous event
*     handler for use with Tcl interpreters.  If it is invoked
*     (by Tcl_AsyncInvoke, as caused by a call to Tcl_AsyncMark),
*     it will cause the interpreter with which it is associated to
*     exit by executing an 'exit' command.  This will allow the
*     interpreter to shut down in an orderly fashion.
*
*     This routine should not be invoked directly by user code.

*  Arguments:
*     interp = Tcl_Interp *
*        A pointer to the Tcl interpreter structure, if a Tcl command has
*        just completed.
*     clientData = ClientData
*        A pointer to the Tcl interpreter structure for which this handler
*        was registered.
*     code = int
*        Return code of some command which has recently been executed,
*        if a Tcl has just completed.

*  Notes:
*     As noted on the Tcl_Async man page, the interp and code arguments
*     will not necessarily have anything useful in them (this will be
*     the case if the hander is invoked while waiting for an X event,
*     which is quite likely).  For this reason, the clientData argument
*     is used to identify the interpreter to be shut down.

*  Note:
*     This doesn't seem to work at all.  Writing an exit instruction
*     ought to cause clean up, but when executed here it doesn't seem
*     to get rid of the adam message relay and its associated
*     monoliths.  It does exit the process, but then the signal alone
*     would do that anyway.  Leave this in place for the moment in
*     case I can work out how to make it work.

*  Name:
*     ccdSigtcl

*  Purpose:
*     Signal handler for Tcl interpreter process.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Description:
*     This routine should be registered as the signal handler for
*     signals which will cause the Tcl interpreter process to terminate.
*     It makes sure that the Tcl Asynchronous handler routine
*     registered in the global variable ccd_async (which routine ought
*     to effect a clean exit) will be called at a safe point in the
*     near future.

*  Arguments:
*     sig = int
*        The number of the signal which has been caught.
