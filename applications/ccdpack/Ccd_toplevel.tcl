#  Name:
#     Ccd::toplevel

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Defines the class of CCDPACK top-level widgets.

#  Description:
#     This class creates a top-level widget with the standard CCDPACK
#     configuration. The positioning of new top-level widgets is set
#     relative to the position of the top left hand corner of the
#     toplevel widgets which are the parents. Thus parents of many
#     toplevel widgets have them displayed overlaid and gradually offset
#     down to the bottom right.
#
#     This class also provides a method "busy" which can be used to make
#     all toplevel widgets display a cursor, except possibly the current
#     (i.e. $oldthis) object.

#  Invocations:
#
#        Ccd::toplevel window [-option value]...
#
#     This command create an instance of a Ccd-toplevel object and
#     returns a command "window" for manipulating it via the methods
#     and configuration options described below. Configuration options
#     may be appended to the command.
#
#        window configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the widget
#     instance has been created).
#
#        window method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this widget.

#  Configuration options:
#
#        -CCDbitmap bitmap
#
#     This option configures the bitmap associated with the top-level
#     widget. This defaults to the CCDPACK standard bitmap. If another
#     bitmap is specified then it is essential that the full path name
#     is supplied.
#
#        -title "string"
#
#     A title for the window title bar.
#
#        -width value
#
#     Width of window.
#
#        -height value
#
#     Height of window.

#  Methods:
#     constructor [-option value]...
#        This method is invoked automatically by the class command and
#	 creates the "Ccd::toplevel" widget with a default configuration,
#	 except when overridden by command line options.
#     destructor
#        Destroys the "class" instance, invoked by the "delete" method.
#     configure [-option value]...
#        Activates the configuration options. If no configuration value
#	 is given then the current value of any known option is returned
#	 in a form similar (but not identical to) the Tk widget command.
#     busy option self
#	 This operates using the blt::busy command. The possible options
#	 being "hold" and "forget". If "hold" is used then all
#	 top-level windows (created by this class) are put on hold,
#	 but, only if they are not already busy. If the current window
#	 is not to be made busy then self should be set false (0). When
#	 an object is destroyed (via the delete method), then any
#	 objects placed on hold by it are released using the "forget"
#	 option, this can also be invoked explicitly. So using these
#	 methods a series of top-level objects can be placed on hold in
#	 any order and they will then be released in the same order
#	 (any holds in effect before an invocation will not be affected
#	 by later "holds" and "forget"s unless it is invoked from the
#	 correct object -- the one that placed the hold).
#     sethelp document label
#        Sets the default help for all widgets within the scope of
#        the top-level window. Document is a name like sun139 and
#        label an xlabel within it (without the xref_ part).

#  Inheritance:
#     This class inherits Ccd::base and its methods and configuration
#     options, which are not directly occluded by those specified here.

#  History:
#     28-MAR-1994 (PDRAPER):
#     	 Original version.
#     4-MAY-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Started move to Tk4. Commented out ::rename in destructor, no
#        longer needed. Toplevels now resize by default.
#     25-MAY-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Added wm command to trap destruction by window manager.
#     13-JUN-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Added -width and -height configuration parameters.
#     11-APR-1997 (PDRAPER)
#        Converted to itcl2.2. blt_busy now called blt::busy.
#     13-MAY-1999 (PDRAPER):
#        Changed stacking behaviour to more WM friendly "wm
#        transient". Explicit raises cause problems with some window
#        managers performance.
#     15-MAY-2000 (MBT):
#        Upgraded for Tcl8.
#     27-JAN-2006 (PWD):
#        Updated for itcl::class syntax.
