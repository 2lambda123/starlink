proc CCDFileToNDFName { filename } {
#+
#  Name:
#     CCDFileToNDFName 

#  Purpose:
#     Changes a filename into an NDF name or foreign data image.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk

#  Description:
#     This routine removes any ".sdf" extensions from filenames
#     and complains if the file extension isn't one of the known
#     formats (if xreduce is setup for foreign data access).

#  Return:
#     CCDFileToNDFName = filename (write)
#        The image name.
