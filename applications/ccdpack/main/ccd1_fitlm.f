*  Name:
*     CCD1_FITLM

*  Purpose:
*     Determines the linear transformations between lists of positions.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_FITLM ( X, Y, ID, OK, NXY, NIM, NALN, IMGID, IFIT, TR,
*                       RELTOL, XOUT, YOUT, IDOUT, XW, YW, IDW, NOUT,
*                       RMS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine finds a set of transformation coefficients which map
*     a set of different positions on to a single reference set of
*     positions. The method allows for all combinations of missing
*     positions.
*
*     The basic method is:
*     First the standard positions are identified using NALN and formed
*     into an initial reference set. Then for each additional list a
*     transformation is calculated between these and the reference set.
*     If this step is successful these positions are added to the
*     reference set to increase the number of positions with which to
*     align. When all the input lists have been processed, the
*     alignment transformations are corrected with the transformation
*     for the standard list such that this transformation becomes the
*     identity (0,1,0,0,0,1). The lists for which transformations have
*     been calculated are then used to estimate an RMS alignment error.
*     The whole process is then repeated using the enlarged reference
*     set until the alignment error converges within a set tollerence
*     or until the maximum number of iterations has been exceeded
*     (error) or until it is established that an list of positions
*     cannot be aligned (error).

*  Arguments:
*     X( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Input X positions. These are used to calculate the alignment
*        transformations.
*     Y( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Input Y positions. These are used to calculate the alignment
*        transformations.
*     ID( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifiers for the input positions.
*     OK( * ) = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace in which to store flags controlling the processing
*        of the input positions.
*     NXY( MAX( NALN, NIM ) ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of entries in the position lists. Each set of
*        positions are added sequentially to the X and Y arrays. This
*        array holds the number of entries from each such list in the
*        order in which they were entered.
*     NIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of input lists for which alignment transformations
*        are required. This may be a number less than the number of
*        sequences of coordinates entered into X and Y but must run
*        from 1 to NIM.
*     NALN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the list to which all the other lists are to
*        aligned too. This
*        list is referred to as the standard list and can be one of
*        the lists 1 -> NIM or a separate reference list. In the
*        latter case positions corresponding to the reference list
*        should appear in the position lists after those to be aligned.
*     LISTID( * ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the input list from which the values have been
*        derived. This is used in messages output to the user.
*     IFIT = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        An integer specifying the type of linear transformation
*        required to fit the data.
*        It's values represent transformations:
*          1 = shift of origin only
*          2 = shift of origin and rotation
*          3 = shift of origin and magnification
*          4 = shift of origin, rotation and magnification (solid body)
*          5 = full six parameter fit
*     RELTOL = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*         Maximum relative change between iterations which must be
*         achieved before routine is considered to have converged.
*     TR( 6, MAX( NIM, NALN ) ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The alignment transformation which is determined for each
*        set of positions.
*     XOUT( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The list of X reference positions used to calculate the
*        alignment transformations on the last iteration. These
*        positions will have been transformed so that the alignment
*        transformation for the standard list is the identity
*        transformation.
*     YOUT( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The list of Y reference positions used to calculate the
*        alignment transformations on the last iteration. These
*        positions will have been transformed so that the alignment
*        transformation for the standard list is the identity
*        transformation.
*     IDOUT( * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifiers for the reference positions.
*     XW( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace for holding X positions. Must be the same size as X.
*     YW( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace for holding Y positions. Must be the same size as Y.
*     IDW( * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace for holding identifiers. Must be the same size as ID.
*     NOUT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of positions in output lists.
*     RMS = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        RMS alignment error on last iteration. The alignment error is
*        iteratively refined until it converges within a relative
*        tolerence (RELTOL) or until all the iterations are used up
*        (MAXIT), resulting in this value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The positions should be arranged consecutively in the input
*     lists (X, Y, ID). These lists will then be accessed using the
*     information in NXY which gives the number of positions
*     corresponding to each particular original list.
