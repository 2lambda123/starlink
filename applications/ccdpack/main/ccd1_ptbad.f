      SUBROUTINE CCD1_PTBAD( TYPE, LBND, UBND, NY, I1, I2, DATA,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_PTBAD

*  Purpose:
*     Fill selected columns of an image with bad values.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_PTBAD( TYPE, LBND, UBND, NY, I1, I2, DATA, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine fills a specified range of columns in an array
*     (regarded as a 2-dimensional image) with the "bad" value.  Other
*     elements of the array are left unchanged.

*  Arguments:
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Data type of the array to be filled: '_REAL' or '_DOUBLE' (in
*        upper case). The routine will return without action if one of
*        these two strings is not given.
*     LBND = INTEGER (Given)
*        Lower bound of the first dimension of the array.
*     UBND = INTEGER (Given)
*        Upper bound of the first dimension of the array.
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second dimension size of the array.
*     I1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Lower bound on the range of columns to be filled (must lie in
*        the range LBND to UBND inclusive).
*     I2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Upper bound on the range of columns to be filled (must lie in
*        the range LBND to UBND inclusive and be at least equal to I1).
*     DATA = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the array to be filled. The region of the array
*        affected is (I1:I2,1:NY) - other elements are returned
*        unchanged. The dimensions of the array should be
*        (LBND:UBND,NY) and its type must match that specified via the
*        TYPE argument.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
