      SUBROUTINE CCD1_NDFMI( PARAM, KEYGRP, GOTGRP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_NDFMI

*  Purpose:
*     Get NDFs matching Set Index attributes from a parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_NDFMI( PARAM, KEYGRP, GOTGRP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine gets a group of NDFs from an ADAM parameter with
*     reference to a group of Set Index keys stored in KEYGRP.
*     The value GOTGRP is returned as a GRP identifier for an NDG
*     group of NDFs; the Nth member of GOTGRP will have a Set Index
*     attribute value which matches the value of the Nth member of
*     KEYGRP.  The members of KEYGRP must therefore be character
*     representations of integers.  If the user does not provide
*     a set of NDFs which allows such a GOTGRP to be constructed,
*     he is re-prompted until he does.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter via which to obtain the NDFs.
*     KEYGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identifier for a group containing string
*        representations of integers.  For each one, the returned group
*        GOTGRP will contain an NDF in the corresponding position which
*        has that Set Index attribute value.
*     GOTGRP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An NDG identifier for a group of NDFs obtained as described
*        above.  In the event of an error, the value GRP__NOID will
*        be returned.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
