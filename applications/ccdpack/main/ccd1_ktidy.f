      SUBROUTINE CCD1_KTIDY( TOTRN, TEXT, INDXY, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_KTIDY

*  Purpose:
*     Make suitable substitutions in a FITS-like keyword.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_KTIDY( TOTRN, TEXT, INDXY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine turns text containing FITS-header-like strings of
*     the form which may be found in the translation tables used
*     by the IMPORT utility into a string suitable for use as a token
*     in TRANSFORM routines.
*
*     In fact it makes two related sets of substitutions: if it finds
*     either a character which is legal in a FITS header but not a
*     TRANSFORM token ('.'), or one of the special strings
*     '<X1>', '<X2>', '<Y1>' or '<Y2>', then it replaces them by
*     something identifiable but palatable to TRANSFORM.
*     Additionally, if exactly one substitution of the X1,X2,Y1,Y2 type
*     has been made, the returned INDXY argument will indicate which
*     it was.
*
*     If TOTRN is FALSE, then X1-type strings will be removed rather
*     than substituted for, and illegal character substitutions will
*     not be made at all.
*
*     The routine is designed to be used with TOTRN = TRUE to generate
*     a token for use in TRANSFORM expressions, and with TOTRN = FALSE
*     to generate a genuine FITS header.  In either case, the INDXY
*     argument can be examined to determine whether an X1-type
*     string was present.

*  Arguments:
*     TOTRN = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If TRUE, then the strings '<X1>', '<X2>', '<Y1>' and '<Y2>'
*        will be turned into something identifiable and the returned
*        string will be legal as a TRANSFORM token.  If FALSE, then
*        the strings '<X1>', '<X2>', '<Y1>' and '<Y2>' will be
*        removed, and the returned string will be legal as a FITS
*        header keyword.
*     TEXT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        On entry a FITS header-like keyword, which may contain
*        substrings of the form "<X1>" etc.  On exit, such strings
*        will be removed or converted as described above.  The string
*        must be long enough to accommodate such substitutions.
*     INDXY = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Indicates which of '<X1>', '<X2>', '<Y1>' or '<Y2>' has
*        been found in TEXT.  If exactly one of these has been found,
*        INDXY will be 1, 2, 3 or 4 respectively.  If more than one
*        was found it will be -1, and if none has been found it
*        will be 0.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The form of the substituted phrases could be harmlessly altered to
*     something else, with the following constraints: they should be
*     at least eight characters long, so that a FITS header with these
*     appended cannot be mistaken for a normal FITS header, and they
*     are alphanumeric so that they can be used as part of a TRN token.
