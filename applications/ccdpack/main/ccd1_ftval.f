      SUBROUTINE CCD1_FTVAL( FTSKEY, INDF, FTSVAL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_FTVAL

*  Purpose:
*     Get FITS value for given keyword from FITS extension of an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_FTVAL( FTSKEY, INDF, FTSVAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine attempts to retrieve the value of a FITS header with
*     a specified FITS keyword, from the FITS extension of an NDF.
*     The first card which matches the given keyword is used.
*     If no FITS extension is found, or no matching header is found then
*     an error message is output and STATUS is set.
*
*     The value returned is a string representation of the value
*     requested.

*  Arguments:
*     FTSKEY = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Name of the FITS header keyword.
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        ID of the NDF containing the FITS extension.
*     FTSVAL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        Character representation of the value of the keyword requested.
*        If the card's value is of character type, it is returned
*        surrounded by single quotes.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status.
