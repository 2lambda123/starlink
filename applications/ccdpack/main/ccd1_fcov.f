*  Name:
*     CCD1_FCOV

*  Purpose:
*     Determines the covariances of a non-linear fit.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_FCOV( M, N, FSUMSQ, X, COVAR, LCOV,
*                     WRK1, WRK2, WRK3, WRK4, IFAIL )

*   Description:
*     This routine calculates the covariance matrix of the estimated
*     regression coefficients for a non-linear least squares problem.
*     It uses the estimate of the jacobian of f(x) at the solution.
*
*     The method used is based on the calculation of the inverse of the
*     cross-products of the jacobian scaled by the variance of the
*     residual at the solution - i.e.
*
*        vars (J^t J)^-1.
*
*     This is calculated using a single value decomposition (which
*     should be more stable to near singularities) using the fact that
*     the inverse cross product of the jacobian may be estimated as
*
*        V S^-2 V^t.
*
*     Where V is the right-hand side of the decomposition and S the
*     vector of singular values.
*
*     This routine is CCDPACK specific and is designed to be called from
*     CCD1_SZSLV after a call to DQEDS. CCD1_CALCJ is defined to use the
*     common block information in CCD1_SZSLV to calculate the jacobian.

*   Arguments:
*     M = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of residuals in used in fit (observations).
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of variables in fit.
*     FSUMSQ = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The sum of squares of the residuals at the solution X
*     X( N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The solution vector.
*     COVAR( LCOV, N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The calculated covariances. This is an NxN section on exit.
*     LCOV = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of COVAR as declared in the calling
*        routine. This must be at least M large.
*     WRK1( N )  = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     WRK2( N )  = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     WRK3( N, M )  = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     WRK4( M )  = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     IFAIL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Indicates the success or failure of this routine. If 0 then
*        a covariance matrix has been sucessfully calculated. If 1 then
*        the calculation has failed. If greater than 1 then the matrix
*        contains linear or near linear dependencies. A matrix has still
*        been calculated and may still be a good solution.
