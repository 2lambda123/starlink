      SUBROUTINE CCD1_DMPRG( FSET, DOMAIN, REPORT, JKEEP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_DMPRG

*  Purpose:
*     Purge a frameset of frames in a given domain.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_DMPRG( FSET, DOMAIN, REPORT, JKEEP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine removes all frames from a frameset which have the
*     domain name supplied.  Optionally, the index of one domain to
*     exempt from this process may be supplied.  For each domain 
*     removed, a message may be logged through the CCDPACK logging 
*     system.
*
*     Normally the Current and Base frames are not disturbed by 
*     this routine.  However, if one of these is deleted, a
*     new Current or Base frame will be assigned using normal AST
*     rules.  The exception to this is that if a Current or Base
*     frame is deleted, and JKEEP is a valid frame index, then JKEEP
*     will become the new one.

*  Arguments:
*     FSET = INTEGER (Given)
*        AST pointer to the frameset.  The frameset may be modified on
*        exit, but the Current frame will not be altered, except in the
*        case that the Current frame is one of the ones removed.
*     DOMAIN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Name of the domain to purge.  Spaces and case-sensitivity are
*        ignored.
*     REPORT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If REPORT is set .TRUE. then for each domain removed, a message
*        is logged through the CCDPACK logging system.  Otherwise 
*        operation is silent.
*     JKEEP = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Any frame with this index will not be deleted, even if it has
*        a Domain of DOMAIN.  On exit, this value will refer to the same
*        frame as on entry, although if frames with indices below its
*        value have been removed, its numerical value will have changed.
*
*        If no frames are to be exempted, this should be set to a 
*        non-positive (e.g. AST__NOFRAME).  In this case, it is allowed
*        to supply a constant rather than a variable for this parameter.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
