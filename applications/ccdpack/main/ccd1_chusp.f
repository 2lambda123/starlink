      SUBROUTINE CCD1_CHUSP( GOOD, INPX, INPY, NINP, OUTPX, OUTPY, IND,

*  Name:
*     CCD1_CHUSP

*  Purpose:
*     Copy positions conditionally.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_CHUSP( GOOD, INPX, INPY, NINP, OUTPX, OUTPY, IND, 
*                      NOUTP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine copies positions (an X and Y coordinate) from
*     an input list to an output list only if a corresponding element
*     of an array of logical flags is true.  It also returns an array 
*     which maps the index numbers of the output points to those of 
*     the input ones, so that it is possible to keep track of which
*     have been selected and which rejected.

*  Arguments:
*     GOOD( NINP ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        An array of flags to indicate whether to select the
*        corresponding elements of INPX and INPY.
*     INPX( NINP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        X coordinates of input list of points.
*     INPY( NINP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Y coordinates of input list of points.
*     NINP = INTEGER (Given) 
*        Number of points in input list.
*     OUTPX( NINP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        X coordinates of output list, i.e. points from input list which 
*        were found to be within the polygon.
*     OUTPY( NINP ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Y coordinates of output list, i.e. points from input list which 
*        were found to be within the polygon.
*     IND( NINP ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Index from input list of each point in output list.
*     NOUTP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of points in output list.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status.
