      SUBROUTINE CCD1_CKCCL( IDIN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_CKCCL

*  Purpose:
*     Checks that an NDF is ok for processing by CALCOR.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_CKCCL( IDIN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine gets the frame type (FTYPE) of the input NDF and
*     checks that it is sensible to perform a CALCOR type calibration.
*     This excludes frames whose type is BIAS and frames which have not
*     been debiassed and any MASTER calibration NDFs.  This latter case
*     is indicated by the presence of an object "DEBIAS" in the CCDPACK
*     extension.

*  Arguments:
*     IDIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine only reports an warning if the type is not good.
*     No other action is taken.
