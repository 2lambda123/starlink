*  Name:
*     CCD1_DCON

*  Purpose:
*     Determines the connectivity of pixels above a threshold.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_DCON( ITYPE, ARRAY, NCOL, NLINE, BAD, THRES, TOUCH,
*                     XLIST, YLIST, ILIST, LABEL, NGROUP, NTHRES,
*                     STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine calls the appropriate version of CCG1_DCN to
*     determine the connectivitity of pixel groups using an 8-connected
*     pixel scan technique. The results of this process are a list of
*     the X and Y positions of the pixels above the threshold, their
*     value (intensity) and a list of labels which indicate which group
*     of connected pixels the pixel belongs to.
*
*     The basic algorithm is to find all non-bad pixels above a given
*     threshold and look at its neighbours at positions
*     x-1,y; x-1,y-1; x,y-1; x+1, y-1. If these are all below the
*     threshold then a new pixel group is begun, if any of these are
*     above the threshold then their group numbers are determined. The
*     current pixel is assigned to the group of one of these pixels and
*     all the groups numbers of these pixels are aliased to the same
*     group.

*  Arguments:
*     ITYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The HDS data type of the input array.
*     ARRAY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The pointer to the input array.
*     NCOL = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension of the pixel array.
*     NLINE = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second dimension of the pixel array.
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether BAD pixels are present in the input data or nor.
*     THRES = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The threshold value. The connectivity of pixels above this
*        value is determined.
*     TOUCH = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether pixel groups may touch the edges of the data array or
*        not.
*     XLIST( * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A list of the X positions of the pixels above the threshold
*        value. This array should be large enough to accomdate all
*        pixels above the threshold.
*     YLIST( * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A list of the Y positions of the pixels above the threshold
*        value. This array should be large enough to accomdate all
*        pixels above the threshold.
*     ILIST( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        A list of the values of the thresholded pixels.
*     LABEL( * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A list of the group to which a given pixel belongs to.
*        Groups are specified by having the same label.
*     NTHRES = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of pixel positions located.
*     NGROUP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of pixel groups located. Note this may not be the
*        actual number of groups returned, but may be used as an upper
*        limit on the this number. Anti-aliasing of initially
*        fragmented groups reduces the number of groups returned from
*        this value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
