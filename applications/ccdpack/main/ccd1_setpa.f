      SUBROUTINE CCD1_SETPA( PARAM, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_SETPA

*  Purpose:
*     Sets the value of a program parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran-77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_SETPA( PARAM, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This is a non-standard routine for setting the value of a command
*     parameter to a value as if given on the command-line. Its use is
*     strictly for super-applications which need to call existing
*     commands directly (so that for instance parameters can be set to
*     null or derived values) and is generally to be avoided.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*       The parameter whose value is to be set.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*       The value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER ({status_access_mode})
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - Uses undocumented SUBPAR calls.
