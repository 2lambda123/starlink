*  Name:
*     CCD1_MLSPG

*  Purpose:
*     Determines the most likely spanning graph of a graph of weighted
*     edges.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_MLSPG( GRAPH, WEIGHT, NEDGES, TOTNOD, QUEUE, BEEN, SPAN, 
*                      SUBGRP, NEWED, NNODE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines the most likely spanning graph of a
*     graph of edges. The most likely in this case is the spanning graph
*     which has the highest weight. The return from this routine are
*     the spanning graph represented in the input form (i.e. a graph of
*     edges and weights) the numbers of edges in the graph, the
*     number of nodes and an array of logical values indicating
*     which nodes have been visited (i.e. are part of the extracted
*     sub-graph).

*  Arguments:
*     GRAPH( 4, NEDGES ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The edges of the graph. The node numbers are held in elements
*        1 and 2 and the original intercomparison index (unique for each
*        node) in position 4.  This graph should be complete (i.e. fully
*        connected) on entry. On exit the graph will be sorted into
*        decreasing weight order.
*     WEIGHT( NEDGES ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        The weights associated with each edge.  On exit this will be
*        sorted to match the positions in the graph.
*     NEDGES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of edges in the graph.
*     TOTNOD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of nodes in the input graph.
*     QUEUE( * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace to hold the queue of nodes still be visited. This
*        should 
*     BEEN( * ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Array of flags indicating which nodes have been visited. The
*        index into this array are those of the node numbers, so this
*        array should be large enough to be indexed by the largest node
*        number.
*     SPAN( 4, * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace graph, needs to be size of SUBGRP
*     SUBGRP( 4, * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The maxiumum likelyhood spanning sub-graph. 
*     NEWED = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of edges in the output sub-graph (second dimension).
*     NNODE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of nodes in the output sub-graph
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - this routine writes CCDPACK logfile information so must
*     be used as part of a CCDPACK application.
