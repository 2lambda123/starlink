      SUBROUTINE CCD1_WRTPA( PARA, LINELN, INDENT, LOG, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_WRTPA

*  Purpose:
*     Writes out a long line of information as a paragraph

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran-77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_WRTPA( PARA, LINELN, INDENT, LOG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine accepts a long-line of characters and writes then
*     out using a maximum line-length. The output can be directed only
*     through the message system or it can be directed through the
*     CCDPACK message routines (possibly going to the logfile.

*  Arguments:
*     PARA = CHARACTER * ( * )  (Given)
*        The line of characters to be output as a paragraph.
*     LINELN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum length of an output line.
*     INDENT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The left-hand indent applied to output lines.
*     LOG = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether to go through the CCDPACK message routines or not.
*     STATUS = INTEGER ({status_access_mode})
*        The global status.
