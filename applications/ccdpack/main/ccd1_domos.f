*  Name:
*     CCD1_DOMOS

*  Purpose:
*     Form a mosaic from a set of NDFs.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_DOMOS( NIN, NDF, LBND, UBND, ADJUST, SCALE, DSCALE,
*                      ZERO, DZERO, ORIGIN, MODIFY, DOOUT, USEVAR,

*  Description:
*     The routine merges an arbitrary set of "input" NDFs into a mosaic
*     by combining their data (and variance) values pixel-by-pixel
*     (matching pixels with the same indices between the input NDFs).
*     It will optionally apply scale factor and zero point corrections
*     to the input data before combining them and, if required, will
*     modify the "input" NDFs themselves using the same corrections.
*     Corrections may be applied to the input NDFs without producing an
*     output mosaic if necessary.
*
*     This routines is designed to limit its use of memory and to
*     access all NDF arrays near-sequentially, regardless of the number
*     of input NDFs or the size of mosaic being produced. It should
*     therefore work reasonably efficiently, in terms of memory usage
*     and I/O, in a wide range of situations.

*  Arguments:
*     NIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of "input" NDFs to be combined into the mosaic.
*     NDF( NIN ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Array of identifiers for the NDFs to be combined.
*     LBND( NDF__MXDIM, NIN ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Array containing the lower pixel index bounds for each
*        dimension of each input NDF.
*     UBND( NDF__MXDIM, NIN ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Array containing the upper pixel index bounds for each
*        dimension of each input NDF.
*     ADJUST = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether to apply scale factor and zero point corrections to
*        the input data.
*     SCALE( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Array of scale factor corrections to be applied to the input
*        NDFs' data values (only used if ADJUST is .TRUE.).
*     DSCALE( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Array of error estimates on the scale factor corrections (only
*        used if ADJUST is .TRUE. and variance values are being
*        corrected, modified or used as weights).
*     ZERO( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Array of zero point corrections to be applied to the input
*        NDFs' data values (only used if ADJUST is .TRUE.).
*     DZERO( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Array of error estimates on the zero point corrections (only
*        used if ADJUST is .TRUE. and variance values are being
*        corrected, modified or used as weights).
*     ORIGIN( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Array of false origin values to be used in applying the scale
*        factor and zero point corrections (only used if ADJUST is
*        .TRUE.). The correction applied to the data in input NDF I is:
*
*           new = ( old - ORIGIN( I ) ) * SCALE( I ) + ZERO( I )
*
*        The origin values should be chosen so as to make the errors on
*        the scale factor and zero point corrections statistically
*        independent.
*     MODIFY = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the input NDFs' contents are to be modified by the
*        scale factor and zero point corrections (if so, then WRITE
*        access must be available for these "input" NDFs). This value
*        is only significant if if ADJUST is .TRUE.. Otherwise, the
*        input NDFs will not be modified.
*     DOOUT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether an output mosaic NDF is to be produced. Note that
*        either MODIFY or DOOUT (or both) should be .TRUE..
*     USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether variance information present in the input NDFs should
*        be used to weight their data values when they are combined
*        (note that input variance information will only actually be
*        used if all the input NDFs contain this information).
*     GENVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether to generate a variance component in the output NDF
*        (note that output variances will only actually be generated if
*        all the input NDFs contain this information and if USEVAR is
*        also .TRUE.).
*     USEWT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether to apply an explicit list of weighting factors to the
*        input NDFs (this will only be done if USEVAR is .FALSE. and
*        USEWT is .TRUE.).
*     WEIGHT( NIN ) = REAL (Given)
*        Array of explicit positive weighting factors to be applied to
*        the input NDFs if USEVAR is .FALSE. and USEWT is .TRUE..
*        Otherwise they will not be used. Note that if both USEVAR and
*        USEWT are .FALSE. and (a) ADJUST is .TRUE., then the scale
*        factor adjustments will be used to derive weights, otherwise
*        if (b) ADJUST is .FALSE, then unit weights will be used for
*        all input NDFs.
*     IMETH = INTEGER (Given)
*        An integer representing the required method for combining the
*        input data into a mosaic:
*           2 = MEAN
*           3 = MEDIAN
*           4 = TRIMMED MEAN
*           5 = MODE
*           6 = SIGMA CLIPPED MEAN
*           7 = THRESHOLD EXCLUSION MEAN
*           8 = MINMAX MEAN
*           9 = BROADENED MEDIAN
*        This, and the following associated arguments, are only used if
*        DOOUT is .TRUE..
*     ALPHA = REAL (Given)
*        Fraction of values to remove from data (appropriate to IMETH =
*        4).
*     NSIGMA = REAL (Given)
*        Number of standard deviations at which to clip the data
*        (appropriate to IMETH = 5 and 6).
*     NITER = INTEGER (Given)
*        Maximum number of clipping iterations (appropriate to IMETH =
*        5 and 6).
*     RMIN = REAL (Given)
*        Minimum allowed data value (appropriate to IMETH = 7).
*     RMAX = REAL (Given)
*        Maximum allowed data value (appropriate to IMETH = 7).
*     NDFOUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier for the output NDF into which the results are to be
*        written. The characteristics of this NDF also determine the
*        shape and data type of the output mosaic. It should not be
*        mapped for access prior to calling this routine. This NDF is
*        required even if DOOUT is .FALSE. (although in this case it
*        will not be written to and may be a "super-set" section of a
*        smaller NDF). If MODIFY is .TRUE., then the extent of this NDF
*        should encompass all the input NDFs (otherwise only part of
*        them will have corrections applied).
*     BAD( 2, NIN ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     BADIN( 2, NIN ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Workspace. This array is only used if (MODIFY.AND.ADJUST) is
*        .TRUE..
*     IBOUND( 2 * ( NIN + 1 ) ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     LIST( 2, NIN ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     PNTR( 2, NIN ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     VARS( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     This routine will correctly set the bad pixel flag value(s) of
*     the output NDF (if generated) and the "input" NDFs (if modified).

*  Algorithm:
*     The main difficulty this routine has to overcome occurs when a
*     large number of input NDFs contribute to a large output mosaic,
*     and where these NDFs overlap in arbitrary ways. The mosaic to be
*     produced is then divided into a large number of "regions" by the
*     boundaries of the input NDFs. Within any region the number of
*     contributing input NDFs is constant, but the number and size of
*     the regions is arbitrary and difficult to cater for.
*
*     In this situation it is not possible to access all the input data
*     and combine it explicitly (too much memory required). Nor is it
*     possible to process each region separately, as this will generate
*     many scattered (hence inefficient) references to the input data,
*     frequently in regions which are also too small for efficiency.
*
*     The approach used here is involves a two-level partitioning
*     scheme. In this, "NDF chunking" (see SUN/33) is used to limit
*     memory usage by coarsely partitioning the mosaic. A finer level
*     of partitioning along a single dimension is then used to break
*     each chunk efficiently into regions where the number of input
*     NDFs may be considered constant (so that data combination can
*     take place). It operates as follows:
*
*     -  The first dimension of the output mosaic having an extent of
*     more than one pixel is identified and the NDF's extent along this
*     dimension (dimension IFIRST) is treated as a "line" of data
*     (normally this will be dimension 1, although not always).
*     -  The output NDF is partitioned using "NDF chunking", the chunk
*     size being chosen both to be an integral number of "lines" and
*     also to limit the amount of memory used at once (taking account
*     of all the workspace arrays to be allocated). In general, each
*     chunk will cross many of the separate "regions" defined by the
*     input NDFs.
*     -  A section is then selected from each of those input NDFs which
*     can possibly contribute to the current chunk. This section is
*     chosen to match the chunk bounds in all dimensions except IFIRST,
*     where it retains the original bounds of the input NDF. The data
*     in each of these sections are then accessed.
*     -  This strategy has the effect of preventing access to the input
*     data from being broken in dimension IFIRST, and hence of giving
*     near-sequential access to the input NDFs as each chunk is
*     processed.  Some padding of input data may still occur
*     (associated with input NDF bounds which cause breaks in
*     sequential access in higher dimensions) but this is relatively
*     inexpensive and the chunk size is restricted to prevent this
*     becoming excessive.
*     -  The above process moves the contributing input data for a
*     chunk into memory in such a way (by virtue of padding) that it is
*     now possible to handle the separate input "regions" simply by
*     partitioning each chunk along dimension IFIRST. This is done by
*     sorting the pixel index bounds for this dimension (both lower and
*     upper) for all the contributing NDFs into ascending order, and
*     considering each resulting dimension interval in turn.
*     -  Within each of these intervals, the number of contributing
*     input NDFs may now be considered constant. Producing the output
*     mosaic is then simply a process of assembling all the
*     contributing data (and variances if appropriate) for each
*     interval into a workspace stack and combining them. The results
*     are then copied to the appropriate part of the output chunk. It
*     is at this point that scattered access to input and output data
*     takes place, but the data now reside in a limited amount of
*     memory, so the cost is small.
*     -  Scale factor and zero point adjustments, if required, are
*     applied to the input data as they are accessed, either directly
*     (if the input NDFs are to be modified) or as values are assembled
*     into workspace for combining.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     If combination routines return information about the production
*     of bad pixels, then handling of this information will need
*     revision.

*  History:
*     3-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     5-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Handle output bad pixel flag values.
*     6-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Eliminated the output mosaic bounds as arguments - now found
*        from the output NDF supplied.
*     6-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Added status checks.
*     6-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Fixed bug: array dimension sizes in wrong order.
*     23-SEP-1992 (RFWS):
*        Changed handling of bad pixel flags for mapped input arrays to
*        allow for possible data conversion errors during mapping (this
*        may happen even if the numeric type in use is "safe" because
*        of potential overflow if HDS data were originally written on
*        another machine with a wider number range).
*     20-OCT-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed calls to CCDPACK version 0.1 standard. This involved
*        modifications so that no variances are produced when UVAR is
*        false. Did not change NARY as handling of output variance stack
*        not effected. Modified deficiencies section to remove these
*        items. Note that if GVAR is true and UVAR false then no output
*        variances are produced when the combination routines are used.
*     2-NOV-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Removed ITYPE2 variable. This was commented as the output
*        processing data type, but was not initialised before use
*        and had only one reference. The reference was changed to ITYPE1
*        as the processing type is always the output type (I hope).
*     18-JAN-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed call to NDF_SBAD when MODIFY to .TRUE. (was .FALSE.)
*        to correctly reset bad pixel flag in NDF.
*     20-JAN-1993 (RFWS):
*        Undid the previous change and instead added the BADIN
*        workspace array. Arranged that if "input" NDFs are being
*        modified, their bad pixel flags are set to their original
*        values before they are mapped for update access, and restored
*        to their modified values before being unmapped again. This is
*        to allow for the fact that "input" (unprocessed) pixels may
*        have a different flag value to "output" (processed) pixels,
*        even although they are stored in the same array.
*     20-JAN-1993 (RFWS):
*        Changed GVAR to be .FALSE. if UVAR is .FALSE. and propagated
*        this knowledge to logical expressions which use these values.
*        Modified the description of GENVAR to reflect this fact.
*     27-JUL-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Added a better estimate of the workspace requirements for
*        covariance matrix. Changed from NII**3 to 0.5*(NNI+1)**3.
*        This reflects the increase of CCD1__MXNDF to 100. 8Mbytes
*        are needed for this array if left at NI**3, this reduces to
*        just over 4 under the new scheme.
*     26-JAN-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Fixed arguments to ccg1_cm3r and ccg1_cm3d to remove 
*        RESVAR, this is not present in subroutines.
*     19-SEP-1996 (PDRAPER):
*        Replaced NAG sorting routine with PDA equivalent.
