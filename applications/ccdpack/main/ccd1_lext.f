      SUBROUTINE CCD1_LEXT( ARRAY, NX, NY, GETY, EROW, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_LEXT

*  Purpose:
*     Extracts a row of values from a list array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_LEXT( ARRAY, NX, NY, GETY, EROW, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine extracts a row of data from a double precision
*     array.

*  Arguments:
*     ARRAY( NX, NY ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Array of data values from which a row of values is to
*        be extracted.
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension of ARRAY.
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second dimension of ARRAY.
*     GETY = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the row to extract from ARRAY.
*     EROW( NROW ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The extracted row of data.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - part of list access routine in CCDPACK.
