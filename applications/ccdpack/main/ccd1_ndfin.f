      SUBROUTINE CCD1_NDFIN( NAME, GID, NNDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_NDFIN

*  Purpose:
*     To access a group of NDFs using NDG.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_NDFIN( NAME, GID, NNDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine accesses a group of NDFs whose ADAM parameter is
*     given by NAME. The NDF group identifier is returned in GID. No
*     limit is placed on the number of members of the group.  The
*     actual number of NDFs is returned as NNDF.

*  Notes:
*     - the GID identifier should be annulled (by calling CCD1_GRDEL)
*     after use of the group has finished.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The ADAM parameter name.
*     GID = INTEGER (Returned)
*        NDG identifier for the group of NDF names.
*     NNDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of NDF identifiers returned from user.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
