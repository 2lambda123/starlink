      SUBROUTINE CCD1_GTWCS( INDF, IWCS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_GTWCS

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain world coordinate system information from an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_GTWCS( INDF, IWCS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns a frameset describing the WCS information
*     in an NDF.  If there is an error, the value AST__NULL is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier for the NDF.
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An AST pointer to the WCS frameset.  Returns AST__NULL if no
*        WCS frameset can be found, or if STATUS is set on entry, or if
*        some other error occurs.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status.

*.

*  Set return value to null pointer, so that if the routine fails to set
*  a non-null value then this will be returned.
      IWCS = AST__NULL

*  Check inherited global status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  Get AST pointer for NDF's WCS component.
