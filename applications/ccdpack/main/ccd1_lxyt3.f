      SUBROUTINE CCD1_LXYT3( X, Y, NIN, TR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_LXYT3

*  Purpose:
*     Transforms the X and Y positions using a linear transformation.
*     This version returns the results in the same array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_LXYT2( XIN, YIN, NIN, TR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine transforms the X and Y positions using a linear
*     transformation whose coefficients are specified by the TR array.
*     The transformed positions are returned in the same arrays as the
*     input vaues.

*  Arguments:
*     X( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Input X positions.
*     Y( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Input Y positions.
*     NIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of input values.
*     TR( 6 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The transformation coefficients. The transformation is:
*
*        XDASH = TR( 1 ) + TR( 2 ) * X + TR( 3 ) * Y
*        YDASH = TR( 4 ) + TR( 5 ) * X + TR( 6 ) * Y
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The linear transform used by this routines is:
*        XDASH = TR( 1 ) + TR( 2 ) * X + TR( 3 ) * Y
*        YDASH = TR( 4 ) + TR( 5 ) * X + TR( 6 ) * Y
