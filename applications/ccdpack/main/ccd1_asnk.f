      SUBROUTINE CCD1_ASNK( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_ASNK

*  Purpose:
*     Sink routine for use by AST Channels.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_ASNK( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine implements a sink routine which has to be passed to
*     the AST Channel construction routines (AST_CHANNEL, AST_FITSCHAN)
*     in order to do input/output on AST objects to a file.  It uses 
*     FIO to do the output, via a file descriptor held in a common block.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Usage:
*     CHAN = AST_CHANNEL( SOURCE, CCD1_ASNK, OPTIONS, STATUS )
