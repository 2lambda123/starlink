      SUBROUTINE CCD1_NDFPG( NAME, GIDIN, NVALS, GIDOUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_NDFPG

*  Purpose:
*     To create an output group of NDFs.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_NDFPG( NAME, GIDIN, NVALS, GIDOUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine calls the NDG package routine NDG_CREAT to create
*     a group of output NDF names. The group GIDIN is used as a
*     modification group on which to base the output names. I.e.
*     *_tmp means that all the output NDFs are to have the same names as
*     the input group except that there will be a trailing _TMP on
*     every name. The number of output NDF names is restricted to be
*     exactly those of the input group.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter to be used for accessing the
*        input data string.
*     GIDIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDG group identifier of the NDFs to be used as modification
*        elements for the output group.
*     NVALS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of NDF names required for the output group (same as
*        the number in the input group).
*     GIDOUT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Group identifier for the output list of NDF names.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
