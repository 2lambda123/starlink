*  Name:
*     CCD1_GROFF

*  Purpose:
*     Determines absolute offsets given a spanning graph

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_GROFF( GRAPH, NEDGES, XOFF, YOFF, NCOMP,
*                      BEEN, QUEUE, XOFFN, YOFFN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines the absolute offsets of the nodes of a
*     spanning graph given the relative offsets and a graph of edges.
*     The reference position is the first node in the graph.  The
*     offsets are assumed to be product of a intercomparison process
*     between NCOMP datasets whose original indexes are stored in (4,*)
*     of the graph On output the offsets (XOFFN and YOFFN) are indexed
*     by the node number as they are now absolute not relative (edge
*     lengths).

*  Arguments:
*     GRAPH( 4, NEDGES ) = INTEGER ) (Given)
*        The spanning graph of edges, related to the offsets XOFF and
*        YOFF. This graph is assumed undirected.
*     NEDGES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of edges in the spanning graph.
*     XOFF( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        X offsets of the nodes whose index is given as described in the
*        Description section.
*     YOFF( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Y offsets of the nodes whose index is given as described in the
*        Description section.
*     NCOMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of nodes whose data were initially intercompared.
*     BEEN( * ) = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace used to indicate which nodes of the spanning tree
*        have been visited. Must be able to be referenced by the largest
*        node number as an index.
*     QUEUE( * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace used to queue nodes yet to be visited on the
*        spanning tree. Needs to be larger than the number of nodes.
*     XOFFN( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        X offsets of nodes to reference node.
*     YOFFN( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Y offsets of nodes to reference node.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
