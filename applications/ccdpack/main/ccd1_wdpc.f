*  Name:
*     CCD1_WDPC

*  Purpose:
*     Writes a command to invoke a CCDPACK routine with multiple input
*     and outputs.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      CALL CCD1_WDPC( LIST, PROG, TYPE, PREFIX, USEPRO, PROTEC, CONTIN,
*                      TRAIL, FD, FTYPES, GIDIN, NNDF, VALID,
*                      POINT, NFRAME, TEMP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine locates all the frame of type TYPE within FTYPES.
*     Unless the TYPE argument is blank in which case all frames are
*     used (except those indicated by the VALID flags). The names of
*     these NDFs are then accessed. These are then written into a file
*     "PROG{n}" (where n is a unique number for this application run).
*     A command is then written to the file FD
*
*       PROG IN=^PROG{n} OUT=*//TRAIL
*
*     which is terminated with a continuation character. The command is
*     written in a style suitable for the type of script using the
*     arguments PREFIX, USEPRO, PROTEC and CONTIN.

*  Arguments:
*     LIST = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether or not the list of NDFs to be processed should be
*        reported via the logging system or not.
*     PROG = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the program to be invoked by this command.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The type of frame to be selected for processing (one of those
*        in FTYPES or ' '. If ' ' then all valid non-master frames are
*        used -- it would be pointless process masters as they have
*        already been done).
*     PREFIX = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The prefix for commands.
*     USEPRO = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether quoting protection should be used (in case special
*        characters are present).
*     PROTEC( 2 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The protection characters (if used).
*     CONTIN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The continuation character for this script type.
*     TRAIL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The trailing modification element to be used when forming the
*        output file names.
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FIO file descriptor of the script.
*     FTYPES( 2, NNDF ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The frame and filter types of the input NDFs. (1,*) are the
*        frame types, (2,*) are the filters.
*     GIDIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        GRP identifier of the input group of NDF names. On exit the
*        group is modified so that the names of the NDFs output from
*        the call produced by this routine are present instead of
*        original input names.
*     NNDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of NDFs.
*     VALID( NNDF ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Mask of flags indicating which NDFs are valid (i.e. those which
*        should be processed, the others are ignored).
*     POINT( NNDF ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace for pointer to frames of given type. On exit this
*        will contain the indices of the frames selected.
*     NFRAME = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of frames of the given type located.
*     TEMP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The name of the temporary file that is used to contain the
*        NDF names. You should arrange to delete this.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     22-SEP-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     31-JAN-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Added ' ' notation for using all valid frames.
*     31-JAN-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Added LIST argument.
*     16-APR-1997 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed to accomodate foreign file formats and slices.
*        Note this now uses IRG1_ routines!
*     29-JUN-2000 (MBT):
*        Replaced use of IRH/IRG with GRP/NDG.
