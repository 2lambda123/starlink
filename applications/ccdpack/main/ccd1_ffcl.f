*  Name:
*     CCD1_FFCL

*  Purpose:
*     To pass information to the appropriate version of CCG1_FFRJ,
*     which removes defects from a substantially smooth array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_FFCL( PTYPE, BAD, IPIN, ID, NX, NY, NITER, GAMMA,
*                     IX, IY, SIGMA, IPOUT, NGOOD, IPWRK,
*                     IPILIN, IPNLIN, STATUS )


*  Description:
*     The routine calls the version of CCG1_FFRJ which is appropriate
*     to the data type in use. The only types allowed are _REAL and
*     _DOUBLE (this is imposed by the blocking routine which handles
*     only these data types). This routine also writes out a message
*     indicating the name of the NDF in use. This is then followed by
*     the iteration mesages from CCG1_FFRJ

*  Arguments:
*     PTYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The data type at which the input arrays are to be processed.
*        Must be one of _REAL or _DOUBLE others are not supported.
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Whether BAD pixels are initially present or not, on exit
*        signfies if pixels have been rejected.
*     IPIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the h2D array which requires cleaning.
*     ID = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier of the origin of the data array.
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension of input array.
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second dimension of input array.
*     NITER = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of cleaning interations.
*     GAMMA = REAL (Given)
*        The number of standard deviations at which rejection occurs.
*     IX = INTEGER (Given)
*        X size of the smoothing box.
*     IY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Y size of the smoothing box.
*     SIGMA = REAL (Returned)
*        Estimate of the RMS noise in an output pixel.
*     IPOUT = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to the cleaned output array.
*     NGOOD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of good pixels left in image after cleaning.
*     IPWRK = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to Workspace of size and type of input data.
*     IPILIN = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to integer workspace of size NX.
*     IPNLIN = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to workspace of size NX of type PTYPE.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Uses pointers to arrays.
