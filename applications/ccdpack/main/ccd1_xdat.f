      SUBROUTINE CCD1_XDAT( IN, NREC, NVAL, OUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_XDAT

*  Purpose:
*     Extracts extra data values from a list array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_XDAT( IN, NREC, NVAL, OUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine extracts data from an input array and writes it
*     to an output array, discarding the first two columns and
*     transposing it.

*  Arguments:
*     IN( NREC, NVAL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Array of data values from which columns are to be extracted.
*     NREC = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of records.
*     NVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of values in each record.
*     OUT( NVAL - 2, NREC ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The output array, containing a transposed copy of the input
*        array with the first two rows missing.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - part of list access routine in CCDPACK.
