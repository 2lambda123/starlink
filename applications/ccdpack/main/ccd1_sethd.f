      SUBROUTINE CCD1_SETHD( KEYGRP, ISUB, PRETXT, KEYTYP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_SETHD

*  Purpose:
*     Writes a log message about Set subgroup processing.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_SETHD( KEYGRP, ISUB, PRETXT, KEYTYP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine writes a short heading through the CCDPACK logging
*     system to indicate that the following messages relate to 
*     processing a particular Set-based subgroup.  The message will
*     look something like:
*
*        ^PRETXT for Set ^KEYTYP ^KEYVAL:
*        --------------------------------
*
*     where KEYVAL is the ISUB'th index of KEYGRP.

*  Arguments:
*     KEYGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for the group containing the names of keys
*        identifying the Set subgroup.
*     ISUB = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the member of KEYGRP whose subgroup is about to 
*        be processed.
*     PRETXT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A string to start the message.
*     KEYTYP = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A string indicating the type of key represented by KEYGRP.
*        This would normally be 'Index' or 'Name'.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
