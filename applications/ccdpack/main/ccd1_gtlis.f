      SUBROUTINE CCD1_GTLIS( NDFS, ITEM, PARNAM, MINOPN, MAXOPN, NOPEN,

*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_GTLIS

*  Purpose:
*     Opens a list of formatted files.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_GTLIS( NDFS, ITEM, PARNAM, MINOPN, MAXOPN, NOPEN, FDS,
*                      FIOGR, NDFGR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine opens a series of formatted files. The names of the
*     files may be accessed in two different (exclusive) fashions. If
*     the NDFS argument is set true then it is assumed that the names of
*     the lists are stored within the CCDPACK extensions of a list of
*     NDFs. The name of the file to be actually returned is stored in
*
*         ndf_name.more.ccdpack.ITEM
*
*     If NDFS is true then a GRP group identifier is passed for a group
*     containing the NDF names.
*     
*     If NDFS is false then it is assumed that the names accessed
*     through the ADAM parameters PARNAM using GRP are just the exact
*     names of the files.  All files are opened using FIO_OPEN and the
*     FIO file descriptors are returned in FDS. If an extension does
*     not exist (or the name within it) or the file cannot be opened
*     then an error is reported and status is set.
*
*     In either case a GRP identfier for the filename group is
*     returned.

*  Arguments:
*     NDFS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the names of the files to be opened are stored with the
*        extensions of NDFs are not. If true the input names are
*        expanded into an NDG group.
*     ITEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Only used if NDFS is true. The name of the extension item
*        with contains the file name.
*     PARNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The ADAM parameter name via which the list of file names is to
*        be accessed.
*     MINOPN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The minimum number of files which need to be opened.
*     MAXOPN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of files which can be opened. This should be
*        not less than the dimensions of the FDS array.
*     NOPEN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of files which were opened.
*     FDS( MAXOPN ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        FIO file system descriptors to the opened files.
*     FIOGR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP group identifier for the names of the files which have
*        opened. This group is intended for use as a modification group.
*     NDFGR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An NDG group identifier for the names of the NDFs from which
*        the filenames were obtained.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The calling routine must close all the files which are opened
*     before exit. 
*     -  The calling routine must annul the group identifiers before exit.

*  History:
*     22-JUL-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     28-JUL-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Added minimum number of input files option.
*     22-JAN-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed to look for names in NDF extensions.
*     11-JUL-1995 (PDRAPER):
*        Now gives up as expected on failure to open file (was trapped
*        in loop, eventually exceeding error stack).
*     3-MAR-1997 (PDRAPER):
*        Removed LOC argument from IRG_NDFEX call (and associated code).
*     29-JUN-2000 (MBT):
*        Replaced use of IRH/IRG with GRP/NDG.
