*  Name:
*     CCD1_FITG

*  Purpose:
*     Performs the fitting of a general transformation between two
*     list of positions.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      CALL CCD1_FITG( MAP, X, Y, PARNM, NPAR, TOLER, IPID1, IPX1, IPY1,
*                      NREC1, IPID2, IPX2, IPY2, NREC2, PARVAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine determines a least squares minimisation solution to
*     the transformation between the points in the input lists which
*     have the same identifiers. The transformations are defined in MAP
*     which contains TRANSFORM (SUN/61) like statements. The parameters
*     present in the transformation strings should be listed in the
*     PARNM. These values are the `variables' for which a minimisation
*     is performed. The transformation strings must contain references
*     to the values given in the variables X and Y -- these are the
*     tokens which represent the input points.  The results of the
*     minimisation process are returned in the array PARVAL and the
*     corresponding parameterisations are PNAM. The actual number of
*     unique parameters are NPAR.
*
*     Before performing the fit this routine matches the identifiers.
*     It then calls a NAg routine to determine the transformation.

*  Arguments:
*     MAP( 2 ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Transformations defining how X and Y mapping to the new X and
*        Y. These should be complete TRANSFORM statements with
*        references to the varaibles X and Y and parameterised by the
*        XPARNM and YPARNM values.
*     X = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*       The character value of the token in the MAP strings which
*       represents the first of the variables.
*     Y = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*       The character value of the token in the MAP strings which
*       represents the second of the variables.
*     PARNM( NPAR ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The names of the parameters which are present in string
*        MAP. (Things like PA, PB etc.). These tokens should be unique
*        in so much that no duplication of the same name occurs. The
*        size of this array should actually be 2 elements greater than
*        the number of parameters. On exit this contains the values
*        X and Y in the last two positions, the other entrie remain
*        unchanged.
*     NPAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of parameter names.
*     TOLER = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The tolerance in the required in the fit.
*     IPID1 = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to an INTEGER array of size NREC1, which contains the
*        identifiers for positions IPX1, IPY1. On exit the data pointed
*        to by this has been rearranged to match the identifiers to the
*        other input list. No values are removed and the correspondence
*        with IPX1, IPY1 is maintained.
*     IPX1 = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to a DOUBLE PRECISION array of size (NREC1). This
*        contains the X positions related to identifiers ID1. On
*        exit the data pointed to by this has been rearranged to match
*        the identifiers to the other input list. No values are removed
*        and the correspondence to IPID1 is maintained.
*     IPY1 = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to a DOUBLE PRECISION array of size (NREC1). This
*        contains the Y positions related to identifiers ID1. On
*        exit the data pointed to by this has been rearranged to match
*        the identifiers to the other input list. No values are removed
*        and the correspondence to IPID1 is maintained.
*     NREC1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of entries in input lists IPID1 and IPX1, IPY1.
*     IPID2 = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to an INTEGER array of size NREC2, which contains the
*        identifiers for positions IPX2, IPY2. On exit the data pointed
*        to by this has been rearranged to match the identifiers to the
*        other input list. No values are removed and the correspondence
*        with IPX2, IPY2 is maintained.
*     IPX2 = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to a DOUBLE PRECISION array of size (NREC2). This
*        contains the X positions related to identifiers ID2. On
*        exit the data pointed to by this has been rearranged to match
*        the identifiers to the other input list.  No values are
*        removed and the correspondence to IPID2 is maintained.
*     IPY2 = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to a DOUBLE PRECISION array of size (NREC2). This
*        contains the Y positions related to identifiers ID2. On
*        exit the data pointed to by this has been rearranged to match
*        the identifiers to the other input list.  No values are
*        removed and the correspondence to IPID2 is maintained.
*     NREC2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of entries in input lists IPID2 and IPX2, IPY2.
*     PARVAL( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        The parameters which define the best fit. On entry these
*        values should be set at initial guesses for the minimisation.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*   Notes:
*      -  This routine accesses and releases its own workspace.
