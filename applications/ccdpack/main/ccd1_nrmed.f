      SUBROUTINE CCD1_NRMED( N, A, AMED, W, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_NRMED

*  Purpose:
*     Normalise corrections to a median value of zero.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_NRMED( N, A, AMED, W, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine normalises a set of corrections so that their median
*     is zero by replacing each value A(I) by (A(I)-AMED) where AMED is
*     the median value. The value of AMED is also returned.

*  Arguments:
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of corrections.
*     A( N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        The corrections to be normalised, updated on output.
*     AMED = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The median value used for normalisation.
*     W( N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
