      SUBROUTINE CCD1_ASFIO( PNFILE, ACMODE, FORM, RECSZ, FD, OPEN,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_ASFIO

*  Purpose:
*     Opens a sequential file via an ADAM parameter

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_ASFIO( PNFILE, ACMODE, FORM, RECSZ, FD, OPEN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine opens a sequential file via FIO_OPEN, using the
*     parameter PNFILE (which should declared a literal).  Up to four
*     attempts may be made to open the file.  If a null response is
*     supplied the file is not opened, and the flag returned indicates
*     this fact. If the file exists and is opened for write access
*     and the open fails then an attempt to delete the previous file
*     is made which if successful is followed by another attempt to
*     open the file for write. If this fails then a error is reported
*     etc. The file opened should be closed using FIO_CLOSE and the
*     parameter annuled using PAR_CANCL.

*  Arguments:
*     PNFILE = CHARACTER *( * ) (Given)
*        Parameter name by which file is to be opened
*     ACMODE = CHARACTER *( * ) (Given)
*        Expression giving the required access mode.
*        Valid modes are: 'READ', 'WRITE', 'UPDATE' and 'APPEND'.
*        For details, see FIO_OPEN.
*     FORM = CHARACTER *( * )(Given)
*         Expression giving the required formatting of the file.
*         Valid formats are: 'FORTRAN', 'LIST', 'NONE' and
*         'UNFORMATTED'. For details, see FIO_OPEN.
*     RECSZ = INTEGER (Given)
*         Expression giving the maximum record size in bytes.
*         Set it to zero if the Fortran default is required.
*     FD = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Variable to contain the file descriptor.
*     OPEN = LOGICAL (Returned)
*         If true the file has been opened.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*         Global status value

*  History:
*     25-MAY-1989 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     11-MAY-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Extracted from AIF and renamed for PISA use. Updated
*        prologue.
*     18-MAR-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Added checks for file opened for write access which fails
*        (on UNIX system).
*     8-FEB-2008 (PDRAPER):
*        Initialise FD to protect against exit without checking OPEN.
