      SUBROUTINE CCD1_ORDG( AGRP1, BGRP1, AGRP2, BGRP2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_ORDG

*  Purpose:
*     Generates an ordered subgroup.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_ORDG( AGRP1, BGRP1, AGRP2, BGRP2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates a group from another one with members and
*     ordering corresponding to a given pair of groups.
*     Given GRP groups AGRP1 and BGRP1 which define the correspondence
*     between pairs of names, this routine will generate a new group
*     BGRP2 which corresponds in the same way to a given group AGRP2.
*     So if AGRP1 consists of the names AX, AY, AZ; BGRP1 consists
*     of the names BX, BY, BZ; and AGRP2 consists of the name AY,
*     a new group BGRP2 will be created consisting of the name BY.
*
*     All groups are treated as plain GRP groups (i.e. any NDG-type
*     supplemental information will be ignored).

*  Arguments:
*     AGRP1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        GRP identifier of the A-type template group.
*     BGRP1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        GRP identifier of the B-type template group.
*     AGRP2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        GRP identifier of the A-type actual group.
*     BGRP2 = INTEGER (Returned)
*        GRP identifier of the B-type actual group, constructed by
*        this routine.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     Use of this subroutine is not a particularly efficient way to
*     proceed; it would in principle be possible not to lose track of
*     the ordering of the output group in the first place.  However,
*     because of the small size of the lists involved, it's hardly
*     going to be a performance bottleneck, and it gives the calling
*     code fewer things to worry about.

*  Global Constants:
      INCLUDE 'SAE_PAR'          ! Standard SAE constants

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER AGRP1
      INTEGER BGRP1
      INTEGER AGRP2

*  Arguments Returned:
      INTEGER BGRP2

*  Status:
      INTEGER STATUS             ! Global status

*  Local Variables:
      INTEGER I                  ! Loop variable
      INTEGER IGOT               ! Position of name in AGRP1
      INTEGER N2                 ! Size of the output group
      CHARACTER * ( GRP__SZNAM ) ANAME ! Name got from AGRP1

*  Initialise error status return value.

*  Copy the corresponding name from BGRP1 to BGRP2.  For the first

*  auxiliary data like case significance flags etc.
