      SUBROUTINE CCD1_HCHAN( LOC, ACMODE, CHAN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_HCHAN

*  Purpose:
*     Create an AST channel.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_HCHAN( LOC, ACMODE, CHAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates an AST channel for use within CCDPACK using 
*     a given HDS locator.  It is a wrapper for AST_CHANNEL 
*     whose purpose is to shield the calling routine from knowledge of 
*     the source and sink routines and global variables required to 
*     make this work.  The routine maps the data and sets up the common
*     block for later use by CCD1_CASRC and CCD1_CASNK.
*
*     The routine should be entered with the locator LOC referring to
*     a CHAR_ component of any (reasonable) length and any (reasonable)
*     line length.  It should not be mapped on entry, but this routine
*     will map it.  After data has been written to it using AST_WRITE
*     (via CCD1_CASNK) the component will be mapped, and may have many 
*     (up to half) blank, i.e.  space-filled, entries at the end of it,
*     which the calling routine may wish to truncate.  After the is
*     finished with, the locator should be annulled (which will unmap
*     the character array) and the Channel should be annulled.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) (Given)
*        An HDS locator for the component to be read from/written to.
*        It must be a 1-dimensional array of type _CHAR*N.  N and the
*        extent of the array can both be any small integer larger 
*        than 1; lines are broken into several array elements and
*        the array extended if necessary.
*     ACMODE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Access mode, 'READ' or 'WRITE' according to whether you want
*        to read from the Channel or write to it.
*     CHAN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        AST pointer to a new channel reading from/writing to the HDS
*        locator referred to by LOC.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Restrictions:
*     As currently implemented, only one AST channel created by this 
*     routine may be in use at once.  No check is performed that the 
*     channel is not already in use.
