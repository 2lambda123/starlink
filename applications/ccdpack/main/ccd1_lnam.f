      SUBROUTINE CCD1_LNAM( PARAM, INDXLO, INDXHI, TITLE, GRPID, COMGID,
     :                      COMMEN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_LNAM

*  Purpose:
*     Lists the contents of an GRP group to a file via an ADAM
*     parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_LNAM( PARAM, INDXHI, INDXLO, TITLE, GRPID, COMGID, 
*                     COMMEN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine writes the names of the elements in the input GRP
*     group into a text file. The text file is opened via the ADAM
*     parameter PARAM.  The names in the group are taken from the index
*     range INDXLO to INDXHI. A title is written to the first line of
*     the file.
*
*     If the COMGID argument is not equal to GRP__NOID then it indicates
*     a GRP group which contains comment strings to be written 
*     alongside the names.  These comments will be appended to each
*     line following a comment character (the GRP COMMENT character 
*     for GRPID, which by default is '#').  If COMGID is GRP__NOID, no
*     comment will be written.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The ADAM parameter used to obtain the text file.
*     INDXLO = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the first element of the group which is to be
*        written out.
*     INDXHI = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the last element of the group which is to be
*        written out.
*     TITLE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A title for the first line of the file. This must contain the
*        character # first (i.e. '#  then the actual comment').
*     GRPID = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identifier of the group.
*     COMGID = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identifier for a group giving a comment string to 
*        append to each line of the output.  It should have the same
*        number of elements as the GRPID group.  If supplied equal to
*        GRP__NOID, no comments will be written.
*     COMMEN = _LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether to write a comment to the user about the name of the
*        output file or not.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
