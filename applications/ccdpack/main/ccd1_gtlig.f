*  Name:
*     CCD1_GTLIG

*  Purpose:
*     Gets a GRP group of validated (formatted) file names.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_GTLIG( NDFS, ITEM, PARNAM, MINOPN, MAXOPN, SKIPMT,
*                      NOPEN, FIOGR, NDFGR, NNOLIS, NLGR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates a GRP group of filenames. The files are
*     tested for existence before entry into the group. The names of
*     the files may be accessed in two different (exclusive) fashions.
*     If the NDFS argument is set true then it is assumed that the
*     names of the files are stored within the CCDPACK extensions of a
*     list of NDFs. The name of the file to be actually returned is
*     stored in
*
*         ndf_name.more.ccdpack.ITEM
*
*     If NDFS is true then a GRP group identifier is also returned
*     for a group containing the NDF names (NDFGR).
*     
*     If NDFS is false then it is assumed that the names accessed
*     through the ADAM parameters PARNAM using GRP are just the exact
*     names of the files.  All files are then opened using FIO_OPEN to
*     test for their existence. 

*  Arguments:
*     NDFS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the names of the files to be opened are stored with the
*        extensions of NDFs are not. It true the input names are
*        expanded into an NDG group.
*     ITEM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Only used if NDFS is true. The name of the extension item
*        with contains the file name.
*     PARNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The ADAM parameter name via which the list of file names is to
*        be accessed.
*     MINOPN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The minimum number of files which need to be opened.
*     MAXOPN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of files which can be opened.
*     SKIPMT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then position list files which exist but contain no
*        positions will be treated in the same way as non-existent
*        position list files (added to the NLGR group).  If false, 
*        they will be treated the same as position list files which
*        do contain positions.
*     NOPEN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of files which were opened (size of FIOGR and NDFGR).
*     FIOGR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP group identifier for the names of the files which have
*        opened. This group is intended for use as a modification group.
*     NDFGR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An NDG group identifier for the names of the NDFs from which
*        the filenames were obtained.
*     NNOLIS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The size of NLGR. 
*     NLGR = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An NDG group identifier for the names of lists/NDFs which were 
*        specified by the user, but have no position list file or,
*        if SKIPMT is true, have empty lists.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The calling routine must close all the files which are opened
*     before exit. 
*     -  The calling routine must annul the group identifiers before exit.

*  History:
*     22-JUL-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     28-JUL-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Added minimum number of input files option.
*     22-JAN-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed to look for names in NDF extensions.
*     25-JAN-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed to not return the FIO identifiers.
*     3-MAR-1997 (PDRAPER):
*        Removed LOC argument and associated code from IRG_NDFEX call.
*     26-APR-1999 (MBT):
*        Modified so that failing to find ITEM in the CCDPACK extension
*        is no longer fatal.
*     29-JUN-2000 (MBT):
*        Replaced use of IRH/IRG with GRP/NDG.
*     16-MAR-2001 (MBT):
*        Added NNOLIS and NLGR arguments.
*     22-MAY-2001 (MBT):
*        Added SKIPMT argument.
