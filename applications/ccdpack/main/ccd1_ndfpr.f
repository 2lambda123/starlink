      SUBROUTINE CCD1_NDFPR( NAME, NDFIN, CLIST, NDFOUT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_NDFPR

*  Purpose:
*     To propagate an NDF using the NDG system.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_NDFPR( NAME, NDFIN, CLIST, NDFOUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine creates a new NDF propagating the components as
*     specified in clist (see SUN/33 for description of clist). The
*     output NDF name is obtained through the NDG system. This is done
*     to keep a uniformity of interface, between all NDG commands specs
*     and prompts (i.e. can be enclosed in quotes, read from a file
*     etc.). The propagation actually occurs using the NDG_NDFPR
*     routine.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The ADAM parameter name.
*     NDFIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier of the NDF to be propagated.
*     CLIST = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The component propagation list (see SUN/33).
*     NDFOUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the output NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     15-JUL-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Original Version.
*     3-MAR-1997 (PDRAPER):
*        Removed top-level locator code (no longer used as HDS closes
*        files correctly).
*     29-JUN-2000 (MBT):
*        Replaced use of IRH/IRG with GRP/NDG.
