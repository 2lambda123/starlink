      SUBROUTINE CCD1_TOUCH( NDFID, TASK, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_TOUCH

*  Purpose:
*     Touches an NDF leaving a taskname item showing the date and time

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_TOUCH( NDFID, TASK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine accesses the CCDPACK extension of the NDF whose
*     identifier is NDFID and creates an item whose name is given as
*     the value of the TASK argument. The value of the TASK object
*     is a string containing the current date and time.

*  Arguments:
*     NDFID = INTEGER (Given)
*        NDF identifier.
*     TASK = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the TASK which is calling thus routine.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:

*           .MORE.CCDPACK.TASK
*     and has the value of the current time and date.
