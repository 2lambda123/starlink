      SUBROUTINE CCD1_SZLSF( IFLAG, M, N, XC, FVECC, FJACC, LJC )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_SZLSF

*  Purpose:
*     Least squares function for scale factor and zero point
*     optimisation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_SZLSF( IFLAG, M, N, XC, FVECC, FJACC, LJC, IW, LIW, W,
*                      LW )

*  Description:
*     This is an instance of the FCN service routine required by the PDA
*     library routine PDA_DNLS1 which solves non-linear least-squares
*     minimisation problems. It is configured for use when determining
*     an optimum set of logarithmic scale factor and zero point
*     corrections for a set of data arrays which have been
*     inter-compared in pairs and for which a set of individual scale
*     and zero differences have been found. The form of this routine is
*     governed by the requirements of the PDA routine.

*  Arguments:
*     IFLAG = INTEGER (Given)
*        Specifies whether residual values and/or their first
*        derivatives are required.
*
*        A value of 0 means that the values in XC and FVECC are
*        available for printing (this service isn't used)
*
*        A value of 1 means that we should calculate FVECC at XC.
*
*        A value of 2 means that we should calculate FJACC at XC.
*
*        The value 3 should never occur.
*     M = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of residuals.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of unknowns.
*     XC( N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Value of the unknowns for which residuals and/or their
*        derivatives are required. The first N/2 of these will be the
*        logarithmic scale factor corrections for each data array; the
*        second N/2 will be the zero point corrections.
*     FVECC( M ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Array of residuals (if required). The first (M-2)/2 of these
*        will be the weighted differences between the logarithmic scale
*        factor difference expected between a pair of data arrays on
*        the basis of the current corrections and the differences that
*        were actually observed. The next (M-2)/2 residuals will be the
*        equivalent values for the zero point differences. The final 2
*        residuals are the weighted mean logarithmic scale factor and
*        zero point corrections (or those for the "reference data
*        array", if given); these serve simply to constrain these
*        corrections to be zero.
*     FJACC( LJC, N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Jacobian array of partial derivatives (if required). This
*        gives the partial derivative of each residual with respect to
*        each correction, evaluated with the current set of
*        corrections.
*     LJC = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension size of the FJACC array.

*  Notes:
*     This routine reads data from global variables held in common.

*  History:
*     30-APR-1992 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     4-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Added ability to constrain the corrections applied to the
*        "reference data array".
*     14-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Installed scaling factors for the variables being optimised
*        and converted the zero point corrections to refer to the mean
*        false origin values stored in global variables.
*     19-SEP-1996 (PDRAPER):
*        Converted to be used from PDA routine PDA_DNLS1, rather than
*        the NAG routine E04GBF.
