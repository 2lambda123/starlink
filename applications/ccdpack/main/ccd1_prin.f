      SUBROUTINE CCD1_PRIN( PROMPT, NDFS, NNDF, FTYPES, FILT, DARK,
     :                      FLASH, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_PRIN

*  Purpose:
*     Gets a list of NDF names their frame types and filter type
*     or exposure factors.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_PRIN( PROMPT, NDFS, NNDF, FTYPES, FILT, DARK, FLASH,
*                     STATUS)

*  Description:
*     This routine intercepts a GRP group from the user and interprets
*     its contents as a list of NDF names together with its frame type,
*     filter type, dark time and pre-flash exposure. Filters are
*     relevant to target and flatfields, exposures to darks or
*     flashes. A null (!)  character for any of the final three fields
*     is accepted and will mean that they are ignored. The input from
*     the user is a GRP group with all these five fields present for
*     each NDF (hence this is really intended for use from a procedure
*     were constructing such a list is not tedious). The outputs are an
*     NDG group of NDFs, a GRP group of their frame types and a group
*     containing the filters a group containing the dark times and a
*     group containing the flash times.

*  Arguments:
*     PROMPT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The prompt to use when getting the GRP group from the user.
*     NDFS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An NDG group identifier for the NDFs.
*     NNDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of NDFs given.
*     FTYPES = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A GRP identifier with a list of the NDF frame types.
*     FILT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Group of the NDF filter types. ! indicates none.
*     DARK = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Group of the NDF dark exposure times. ! indicates none.
*     FLASH = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Group of the NDF pre-flash exposure time. ! indicates none.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     23-MAY-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     24-MAY-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Added dark and pre-flash arguments.
*     29-JUN-2000 (MBT):
*        Replaced use of IRH/IRG with GRP/NDG.
*     27-JUN-2001 (MBT):
*        Replaced use of CCD1__MXNDF by CCD1__MXINS (I think the original
*        was a mistake).
