      SUBROUTINE CCD1_CALCJ( M, N, XC, FJACC, LJAC )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_CALCJ

*  Purpose:
*     Calculates the jacobian matrix for the non-linear least squares
*     problem of CCD1_SZSLV.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_CALCJ( M, N, XC, FJACC, LJAC )

*  Description:
*      This routine calculates the jacobian matrix of partial derivates
*      for the non-linear least squares equations solved by the routine
*      CCD1_SZSLV. It uses the information stored in commons blocks about
*      the pair-wise relative scale and zero point corrections that is
*      created for the PDA_DQED solver.

*  Arguments:
*     M = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of residuals.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of unknowns.
*     XC( N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Value of the unknowns for which derivatives are required.  The
*        first N/2 of these will be the logarithmic scale factor
*        corrections for each data array; the second N/2 will be the
*        zero point corrections.
*     FJACC( LJAC, N ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Jacobian array of partial derivatives. This
*        gives the partial derivative of each residual with respect to
*        each correction, evaluated with the current set of
*        corrections.
*     LJAC = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension of FJACC. Should be at least M.

*  Notes:
*     This routine reads data from global variables held in common.

*  History:
*     30-APR-1992 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     4-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Added ability to constrain the corrections applied to the
*        "reference data array".
*     14-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Installed scaling factors for the variables being optimised
*        and converted the zero point corrections to refer to the mean
*        false origin values stored in global variables.
*     23-SEP-1996 (PDRAPER):
*        Version for CCDPACK covariance matrix created from the bones
*        of CCD1_SZLSF during NAG removal.
