*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_REXP

*  Purpose:
*     To report the parameters used in the DEBIAS data expansion and
*     saturation section.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_REXP( EXPAND, SATUR, SETSAT, SATVAL, EXTSAT,
*                     NSAT, DEFER, EXTDEF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine writes out the values used in the data expansion,
*     saturation and deferred charge correction section. So:
*
*     Data EXPANSION, SATURATION and DEFERRED charge correction.
*     ----------------------------------------------------------
*
*     Data expanded to counts (electrons)
*     or
*     Data not expanded (output in ADUs)
*     Data has been corrected for any saturated pixels
*     or
*     Data has not been corrected for saturated pixels
*     Saturation value          :
*     Number of saturated pixels:
*     Saturated pixels set BAD
*     or
*     Saturated pixels set to saturation value
*     Deferred charge correction:
*
*     The output is echoed to the log file if requested. Values obtained
*     from NDF extensions are indicated with an "*".

*  Arguments:
*     EXPAND = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Set true if the data has been expanded to counts.
*     SATUR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Set true if the data has been saturated.
*     SETSAT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Set true if the data has been set to the saturation value.
*        False if the saturated data has been set BAD.
*     SATVAL = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The saturation value.
*     EXTSAT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the saturation value has been obtained from an NDF
*        extension or not.
*     NSAT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of saturated pixels.
*     DEFER = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The deferred charge value.
*     EXTDEF = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the deferred charge has been obtained from an NDF
*        extension or not.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
