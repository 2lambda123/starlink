      LOGICAL FUNCTION CCD1_MATCH( STRING, LIST, NLIST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_MATCH

*  Purpose:
*     Checks a given string against a list.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = CCD1_MATCH( STRING, LIST, NLIST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine checks the character string STRING against those
*     values in LIST looking for a match. If a match is found then
*     CCD1_MATCH is returned as true.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The string to compare against
*     LIST( NLIST ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        List of character strings to match STRING against.
*     NLIST = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of entries in LIST.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     CCD1_MATCH = LOGICAL
*        True if a match is found.
