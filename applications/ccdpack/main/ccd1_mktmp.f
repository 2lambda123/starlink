      SUBROUTINE CCD1_MKTMP( QUAN, TYPE, ID, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_MKTMP

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a temporary HDS object for use as workspace.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_MKTMP( TYPE, SIZE, ID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Use this routine when allocating non-NDF temporary disk-file
*     space in CCDPACK. Access is given to vectorised quantities of any
*     numeric type. This routine just returns an identifier to the
*     workspace which may be used with the functions.
*
*         CCD1_MPTMP   - which maps in the workspace
*         CCD1_UNTMP   - which unmaps the workspace
*         CCD1_FRTMP   - which frees the workspace (unmapping and
*                        releasing the locator)
*
*     Only use these routines or not all at all. The UNTMP and FRTMP
*     routines accept -1 as their first argument (instead of an
*     identifier) this either unmaps ALL workspace or unmaps and annuls
*     ALL workspace (no nesting). This routine should always be called
*     at least once before using the deallocation routines.

*  Arguments:
*     QUAN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The quantity of workspace required in units of TYPE.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The numeric type of the workspace which is required. Can only
*        be one of _BYTE, _UBYTE, _WORD, _UWORD, _INTEGER, _REAL, _DOUBLE and
*        _LOGICAL.
*     ID = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The identifier to the quantity of workspace.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Type Definitions:
      IMPLICIT NONE              ! No implicit typing

*  Global Constants:
