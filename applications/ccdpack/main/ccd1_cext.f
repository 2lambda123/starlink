      SUBROUTINE CCD1_CEXT( ID, CREATE, ACCESS, LOC, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_CEXT

*  Purpose:
*     Checks the CCDPACK extension in an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_CEXT( ID, CREATE, ACCESS, LOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine first checks if the CCDPACK extension exists. If
*     it does then a locator is returned to it. If the extension does
*     not exist then either one is created or an error is reported.

*  Arguments:
*     ID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier of NDF.
*     CREATE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether to create an extension if ones does not exists.
*     ACCESS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The extension access mode: 'READ', 'WRITE', 'UPDATE'.
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        Locator to CCDPACK extension of NDF.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
