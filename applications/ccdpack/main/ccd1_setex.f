      SUBROUTINE CCD1_SETEX( NULL, NL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_SETEX

*  Purpose:
*     Return the current parameter system null symbol (shriek).

*  Language:
*     Fortran-77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_SETEX( NULL, NL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns, as a character string, the current symbol
*     used as the NULL value. Currently this is set to "!" for all
*     systems except IRAF, which uses the string "INDEF". 
*
*     This routine is for use in constructing output messages which
*     advise on the use of the NULL symbol.

*  Arguments:
*     NULL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The current NULL symbol. This should be at least 5 characters big.
*     NL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of characters in NULL.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
