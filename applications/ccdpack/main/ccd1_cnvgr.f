      SUBROUTINE CCD1_CNVGR( IFSETS, NFSET, DMNS, NDMN, USESET, SNAME,
     :                       GRAPH, NEDGE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_CNVGR

*  Purpose:
*     Create a graph of conversions between frameset pairs.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_CNVGR( IFSETS, NFSET, DMNS, NDMN, USESET, SNAME, GRAPH,
*                      NEDGE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates a representation of a graph in which the
*     nodes are AST framesets and the edges are conversions between
*     them.  A maximum of one edge between two nodes is allowed, and
*     represents the conversion using one of the intermediate domains
*     given in the DMNS array; preferentially the first, if that fails
*     then the second, and so on.  The graph is returned as a series
*     of edges, each containing the node numbers, the index of the 
*     domain used for matching, and an index into any associated data
*     created.  If USESET is true, then the first domain in DMNS
*     is only used if the corresponding SNAME values match; in this
*     way Set-based alignment can be taken account of.

*  Arguments:
*     IFSETS( NFSET ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Array of AST pointers to framesets.
*     NFSET = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimension of IFSETS.
*     DMNS( NDMN ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Ordered list of domains in which frame matching should occur.
*     NDMN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimension of DMNS.
*     USESET = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, then the first domain in DMNS will be ignored unless
*        the elements of the SNAME array for the two framesets being
*        matched are the same.
*     SNAME( NFSET ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        If USESET is true, then this array is used to store the Set
*        Name attribute corresponding to each frameset.
*     GRAPH( 4, * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The graph as a set of edges, with node numbers (1,*) and (2,*),
*        match domain indices (3,*), and index into associated data
*        (4,*) (this last is not really used, but exists for
*        compatibility with other CCD1_ graph handling routines). 
*        The second dimension should be large enough to hold all 
*        possible matches, NFSET * ( NFSET - 1 ) / 2.
*     NEDGE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Second dimension of GRAPH, which is the number of successful
*        conversions.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The algorithm used makes use of high-level AST routines
*     including AST_CONVERT.  If necessary it could probably be recoded 
*     more efficiently by examining the Domain attributes of each frame
*     in turn directly.
