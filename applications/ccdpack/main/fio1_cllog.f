      SUBROUTINE CCD1_CLLOG( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_CLLOG

*  Purpose:
*     To close the CCDPACK log file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_CLLOG( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Closes the CCDPACK log file if it has been opened and flagged in
*     the log system common block. THIS VERSION USES FIO and PSX.
*
*     Notes:
*        -  This version is designed for use on machines which do not
*        support the ICL/ADAM logging system. It uses FIO and PSX open
*        and control the file, and to perform the date/time stamping.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
