      SUBROUTINE CCD1_RMCOM( LINE, NCHAR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_RMCOM

*  Purpose:
*     To check for in-line comments.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_RMCOM( LINE, NCHAR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine checks the given line of data for the presence of any
*     of the comment delimiters `!' or `#'. If it finds any then the
*     line character counter is set to truncate to the right of this
*     place, excluding trailing blanks. The input string is unmodified.

*  Arguments:
*     LINE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The line to be checked for in line comments.
*     NCHAR = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The  number of non-blank characters (from start), excluding
*        in-line comments. Used to trim string to relevant part.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
