      SUBROUTINE CCD1_FLNMS( LIST, NNDF, VALID, MASK, FILNMS, NNAMES,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_FLNMS

*  Purpose:
*     Extracts and list filters types.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_FLNMS( LIST, NNDF, VALID, MASK, FILNMS, NNAMES, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine looks at frames which (may) have a filter type and
*     creates a list of the filter types.

*  Arguments:
*     LIST( 2, NNDF ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        List of frame-types and filters.
*     NNDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of entries in LIST.
*     VALID( NNDF ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Mask of entries in LIST on input. Any values in LIST whose
*        corresponding entrie in VALID is FALSE will not be processed.
*     MASK( NNDF ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Workspace.
*     FILNM( NNDF ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        List of filter names.
*     NNAMES = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of output entries in FILNM.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
