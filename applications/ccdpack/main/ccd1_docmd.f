      SUBROUTINE CCD1_DOCMD( STYPE, SCRIPT, LOGFIL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_DOCMD

*  Purpose:
*     Executes a CCDPACK command procedure.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_DOCMD( SCRIPT, LOGFIL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine executes a CCDPACK command procedure in a forked
*     process. The new process is independent of the current execution
*     environment as a copy of all the current application parameter
*     files is taken.

*  Arguments:
*     STYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The type of script to be executed. This can be "CSH" or "ICL"
*        The different script types require executing in different ways.
*     SCRIPT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the file containing the CCDPACK commands which are
*        to be executed.
*     LOGFIL = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The logfile for the output from the script when it is
*        executed.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     UNIX specific file names etc.
