*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_GRPTH

*  Purpose:
*     Find the best path through a graph.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_GRPTH( GRAPH, NEDGE, NODE1, NODE2, WORK, WORK2, PATH,
*                      NSTEP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine operates on a graph expressed as a set of edges,
*     and finds the best path (subgraph) from one node to another.
*     As currently implemented, "best" means the one with the smallest
*     number of edges, and if there is a tie, the one with the smallest
*     sum of edge weights is chosen, where the weight is an integer 
*     associated with each edge, is chosen.

*  Arguments:
*     GRAPH( 4, NEDGE ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        A set of edges, with node numbers at positions (1,*) and (2,*) 
*        and weights at positions (3,*).  Note that for the purpose of
*        this routine, a small weight is preferable. The fourth
*        position is unused and present for compatibility with other
*        CCD1_ graph handling routines.  The graph must contain a
*        maximum of one edge between any pair of nodes.
*     NEDGE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of edges in GRAPH.
*     NODE1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the node at which the path must start.
*     NODE2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the node at which the path must terminate.
*     WORK( 4, * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace.  The second dimension should be at least the number
*        of distinct nodes represented in the graph.
*     WORK2( * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace.  Its dimension should be at least the number of 
*        distinct nodes represented in the graph.
*     PATH( 4, * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A set of NSTEP edges from GRAPH for which PATH(1,1) = NODE1,
*        PATH(2,NSTEP) = NODE2, and PATH(2,N-1) = PATH(1,N) for 
*        N = 2..NSTEP.  The second dimension should be at least the 
*        number of distinct nodes represented in the graph.
*     NSTEP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of edges in PATH.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
