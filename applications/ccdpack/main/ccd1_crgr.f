      SUBROUTINE CCD1_CRGR( WEIGHT, NW, NNODES, GRAPH, NEDGES, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_CRGR

*  Purpose:
*     Creates a graph of edges for CCDOFF intercomparisons.

*  Language:
*     Starlink FORTRAN 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_CRGR( WEIGHT, NW, NNODES, GRAPH, NEDGES, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine generates a graph expressed as a series of edges and
*     weights, from the information generated by intercomparing
*     positions lists.

*  Arguments:
*     WEIGHT( NW ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The weights associated  with the edges of the graph. These are
*        the numbers of point-pairs successfully matched between the
*        position lists (nodes). A null weight is indicated by a value
*        of zero.
*     NW = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of weights given
*     NNODES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of nodes whose positions were intercompared to
*        generate the weighting data. The intercomaprison loop is
*        assumed to be of the form.
*             do i = 1, nnodes - 1
*                do j = i + 1, nnodes
*                enddo
*             enddo
*        This is essential if the node numbers in the graph edges are
*        to be correct.
*     GRAPH( 4, * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The graph with the nodes numbers (positions (1,*) and (2,*) )
*        of the edge, (3,*) the associated weights, and (4,*) the index
*        into any associated data created during the intercomparison.
*     NEDGE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of valid edges entered into the graph.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
