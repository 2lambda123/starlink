      SUBROUTINE CCD1_OVLAP( NDF1, NDF2, NPIX, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_OVLAP

*  Purpose:
*     Find the number of pixels overlap between two NDFs.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_OVLAP( NDF1, NDF2, NPIX, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine returns a count of the number of pixels overlap
*     between two NDFs whose identifiers are supplied. If the NDFs do
*     not overlap, a value of zero is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        First NDF identifier.
*     NDF2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second NDF identifier.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of pixels overlap.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     A value of zero will be returned for the NPIX argument if this
*     routine returns unsuccessfully for any reason.
