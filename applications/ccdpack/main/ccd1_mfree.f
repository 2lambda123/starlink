      SUBROUTINE CCD1_MFREE( POINT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_MFREE

*  Purpose:
*     Frees memory allocated by CCD1_MALL

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_MFREE( POINT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine frees memory allocated by the routine CCD1_MALL.
*     If the value of the pointer variable is -1 then all memory
*     which has been allocated is freed. No errors are reported
*     from this routine regardless of the severity, except for the case
*     when an apparent overflow in resources has occurred and has not
*     been rectified. This is a programming error.

*  Arguments:
*     POINT = INTEGER (Given)
*       Pointer to the memory which is to be deallocated. If the
*       value of this is -1 then all memory is deallocated (regardless
*       of the value of STATUS).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - Either CCD1_START or CCD1_MALL should be called before this
*     routine. This initialises the common block, this is not necessary
*     if this routine is called with STATUS set.

*  Type Definitions:
      IMPLICIT NONE              ! No implicit typing

*  Global Constants:
      INCLUDE 'CCD1_PAR'         ! CCDPACK parameterisations

*  Global Variables:
      INCLUDE 'CCD1_MEMCM'       ! Dynamic memory common block
*        CCD1_MEMCM( CCD1__MXPNT ) = INTEGER (Read and Write)
*           Array of pointers to any data which is allocated by this
*           routine. This common block is updated with the value of the
*           pointer on allocation and the value is removed on
*           deallocation (by CCD1_MFREE).
*
*        CCD1_OVER = INTEGER (Read and Write)
*           The number of calls for memory that have exceeded the
*           storage space available in the common block. This is
*           decremented by calls that do not have an associated pointer
*           slot (but only when overflow has occurred). If the -1
*           mechanism is invoked and overflow is still present a
*           warning message results.

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER POINT

*  Status:

*  Local Variables:
      INTEGER I                  ! Loop variable
      LOGICAL LOCATE             ! Located pointer
