      SUBROUTINE CCD1_CKFTY( ID, TYPE, ACCEPT, IGNORE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_CKFTY

*  Purpose:
*     Checks the CCDPACK frame type.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_CKFTY( ID, TYPE, ACCEPT, IGNORE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine checks that the type of a single frame is equivalent
*     to TYPE given the values of ACCEPT and IGNORE. The ACCEPT 
*     argument specifies the number of underscores up to which the name
*     must be equivalent. IGNORE specifies how many underscores in the
*     NDF type are ignored. So for instance if we have.
*
*       TYPE='MASTER_BIAS' ACCEPT=1 IGNORE=0
*
*    Then the NDF frame type must be equal to 'MASTER_BIAS'. If we have
*
*       TYPE='TARGET' ACCEPT=0 IGNORE=0
*
*    Then the NDF frame type must be equal to 'TARGET'. If we have
*
*       TYPE='TARGET_PROCESSED' ACCEPT=0 IGNORE=0
*
*    Then the NDF frame type must be 'TARGET'. If we have
*
*       TYPE ='PROCESSED_FLATTENED' ACCEPT=2 IGNORE=1
*
*    The the NDF type must be 'XXXX_PROCESSED_FLATTENED' and the
*    XXXX_ in the name will be ignored etc.
*
*    Failure to meet any of these requirements is not critical
*    and a warning message is just issued.

*  Arguments:
*     ID = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF whose typing is to be checked.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        String specifying the characters expected to be found in the
*        NDF frame type.
*     ACCEPT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of underscores which should be included in the NDF
*        name when extracted from the NDF extension.
*     IGNORE = INTEGER (Given)
*        How many underscores (and the characters in between them) are
*        to be not considered in the match (from the front of the NDF
*        type string)>
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Just because this subroutine doesn't issue a warning isn't a
*     guarantee that everything is ok. This is just a courtesy function.
