      SUBROUTINE CCD1_GTCMP( NNDF, NDF, IPAIR, NPIX, NCMP, NOV, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_GTCMP

*  Purpose:
*     Identify pair-wise overlaps between NDFs for MAKEMOS.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_GTCMP( NNDF, NDF, IPAIR, NPIX, NCMP, NOV, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine examines each possible pair of NDFs taken from a list
*     supplied by the MAKEMOS application and forms a list of those
*     pairs which have pixels in common (as identified by their pixel
*     indices). It also returns a count of the number of pixels of
*     overlap for each pair and the number of overlaps which each NDF
*     has with others.  An error is reported and STATUS set if any NDF
*     does not overlap with others.

*  Arguments:
*     NNDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of NDFs.
*     NDF( NNDF ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Array of identifiers for the NDFs to be considered.
*     IPAIR( 2, * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A list of pairs of indices (into the NDF array) indicating
*        which pairs of NDFs overlap. The second dimension size should
*        be at least equal to the number of pair-wise overlaps between
*        the NDFs supplied. The number of overlaps returned is given
*        by the NCMP argument.
*     NPIX( * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of pixels of overlap between each pair.  The size
*        of this array should be at least equal to the number of
*        pair-wise overlaps between the NDFs supplied.  The number of
*        values returned is given by the NCMP argument.
*     NCMP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of overlaps in total.
*     NOV( NNDF ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of overlaps which each NDF has with others,
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
