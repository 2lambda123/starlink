      SUBROUTINE CCD1_DUESC( STRING, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_DUESC

*  Purpose:
*     To duplicate any MSG system escape characters.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_DUESC( STRING, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine loops through a given string looking for MSG system
*     escape characters, if it finds any then they are duplicated. This
*     allows a string which has been MSG_LOADed to be passed back
*     through the MSG_OUT routine with out secondary token replacement.
*     It can also be used on loaded NDF_MSG strings etc. which have
*     device characters like $ etc.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The character buffer which may contain escape sequences in need
*        of duplication before passing back through the message system.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
