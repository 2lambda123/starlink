      SUBROUTINE CCD1_GTDIR( USEEXT, ID, DIRECT, FRMEXT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_GTDIR

*  Purpose:
*     To get the CCD readout direction

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_GTDIR( USEEXT, ID, DIRECT, FRMEXT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the readout direction. The "intrinsic" value
*     for the readout may be accesses by two routes. If USEEXT is false
*     then the ADAM parameter DIRECTION is used to get a value. This
*     value is tested to see if it is X or Y, if it is not
*     then the user is reprompted for another value. If the value is X
*     then the DIRECT argument is assigned a value of 1, if the
*     character is Y then the DIRECT argument is assigned a value of 2.
*
*     If USEEXT is true then the NDF itself is accessed and the CCDPACK
*     extension item DIRECTION is obtained. If this doesn't exist
*     then the user is prompted, otherwise the value is returned.
*     On exit the value or the argument FRMEXT indicates whether the
*     value was obtained from the NDF extension or not.

*  Arguments:
*     USEEXT = LOGICAL (Given)
*       Whether to look in the extension of the NDF for the readout
*       direction or not.
*     ID = INTEGER (Given)
*       NDF identifier. Only used if USEEXT is true.
*     DIRECT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The readout direction 1 or 2.
*     FRMEXT = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether or not the value was actually obtained from the NDF
*        extension.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
