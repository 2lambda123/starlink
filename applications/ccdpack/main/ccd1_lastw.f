      SUBROUTINE CCD1_LASTW( STRING, INDEX, NOTFND, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_LASTW

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the start of the current word.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_LASTW( STRING, INDEX, NOTFND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Finds the start of the current word. Starts of words are
*     indicated by the presence of a space delimeter. INDEX is updated
*     on exit to the start of the word.

*  Arguments:
*     STRING = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The string to search for the beginning of the word.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Position within string to start looking for start of word,
*        updated to the start of the word on exit.
*     NOTFND = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Set true if start of word is not located before start of string
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
