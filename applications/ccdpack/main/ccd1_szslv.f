*  Name:
*     CCD1_SZSLV

*  Purpose:
*     Solve for optimum scale factor and zero point corrections.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_SZSLV( GETS, GETZ, NIN, NCMP, NMAX, SCALE, DSCALE, ZERO,
*                      DZERO, ORIG, WRK1, WRK2, WRK3, WRK4, WRK5,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine takes as input a set of differences obtained by
*     inter-comparing members of a set of data arrays in pairs.  It is
*     assumed that the arrays all represent the same observations but
*     that each has been perturbed by an unknown scale factor and/or
*     zero point.  The routine solves for a set of corrections for
*     these perturbations which, when applied to the data arrays, will
*     best correct for the set of differences found, subject to the
*     constraint that the median scale factor correction should be
*     unity and the median zero point correction should be zero (unless
*     a reference array is identified, in which case the corrections
*     are normalised with respect to it).
*
*     The returned corrections should be applied to the data arrays
*     such that the I'th array is corrected using the formula:
*
*        result = ( DATA - ORIG( I ) ) * SCALE( I ) + ZERO( I )
*
*     Statistical error estimates are also calculated for the SCALE and
*     ZERO values.

*  Arguments:
*     GETS = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether scale factor corrections should be calculated
*        (otherwise they are simply set to unity).
*     GETZ = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether zero point corrections should be calculated (otherwise
*        they are simply set to zero).
*     NIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of data arrays.
*     NCMP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of data array inter-comparisons.
*     NMAX = INTEGER (Given)
*        NMAX is the maximum of 2*(NIN+1) and 2*(NCMP+1). Is is used
*        when declaring workspace sizes.
*     SCALE( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Array of scale factor corrections.
*     DSCALE( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Array of scale factor standard errors associated with the
*        corrections in SCALE.
*     ZERO( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Array of zero point corrections.
*     DZERO( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Array of zero point standard errors associated with the
*        corrections in ZERO.
*     ORIG( NIN ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Array of false origin values. These do not affect the
*        corrections derived (any change in the value of ORIG being
*        compensated by a corresponding change in ZERO), but are chosen
*        so that the errors on the SCALE and ZERO values are expected
*        to be un-correlated.
*     WRK1( i ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace. If (GETS.AND.GETZ) is true, then i should equal
*        NMAX, otherwise, if (GETS.OR.GETZ) is .TRUE., then i should
*        equal 2*(NIN+1), otherwise, this array is not used.
*     WRK2( 17*NMAX+40 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Workspace. This is only required if (GETS.AND.GETZ) is .TRUE..
*     WRK3( NMAX*(NMAX+2) ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace. This is only required if (GETS.AND.GETZ) is .TRUE..
*     WRK4( 4 * NMAX * NMAX + 86 * NMAX + 141 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace. This is only required if (GETS.AND.GETZ) is .TRUE..
*     WRK5( NMAX * NMAX ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Workspace. This is only required if (GETS.AND.GETZ) is .TRUE..
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine accesses data via global variables held in
*     common.
*     -  If the set of data array inter-comparisons provided for this
*     routine to use (via global variables) is inadequate to determine
*     the required corrections, then an error will be reported and
*     STATUS will be returned set to the value USER__001, as defined in
*     the include file USER_ERR.

*  History:
*     28-FEB-1992 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     21-APR-1992 (RFWS):
*        Changed to optimise scale factor and zero point corrections
*        simultaneously.
*     29-MAY-1992 (RFWS):
*        Added passing of workspace arrays.
*     2-JUN-1992 (RFWS):
*        Return USER__001 error code if required.
*     3-JUN-1992 (RFWS):
*        Added the IREF argument.
*     5-JUN-1992 (RFWS):
*        Corrected error in normalisation; normalise zero points before
*        shifting the origin (instead of after).
*     27-JUL-1992 (RFWS):
*        Improved the algorithm for normalising the weights to allow
*        for the typically different ranges of the scale factor and
*        zero point differences.
*     5-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Removed the IREF argument (now a global variable).
*     6-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Installed correct handling of reference data array
*        constraints.
*     22-SEP-1992 (RFWS):
*        Installed scaling to prevent numerical problems during
*        simultaneous optimisation of scale factor and zero point
*        corrections.
*     23-SEP-1992 (RFWS):
*        Ignore IFAIL>2 returned by E04YCF.
*     16-SEP-1996 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed all NAG routine calls to PDA versions. Substantial
*        changes to non-linear solutions. Linear solutions more or
*        less remain the same.
*     15-OCT-1996 (PDRAPER):
*        More substantial changes to non-linear solutions, these now use
*        a constraint based solver. Linear solutions more or less remain
*        the same (a good replacement for these was found, the
*        non-linear case, due to the conditioning imposed by the median
*        scale and zero points constraint proved too much for all the
*        global minimization routines I found).
*     01-JUL-1999 (PDRAPER):
*        Added initialization of ORIG values. These where not set if 
*        GETS or GETZ only where true (Linux random values).
