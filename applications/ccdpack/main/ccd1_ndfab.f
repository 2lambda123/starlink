      SUBROUTINE CCD1_NDFAB( CNAME, USEEXT, NDFNAM, MAXNDF, FACNAM,
     :                       INGRP, FACTS, NNDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_NDFAB

*  Purpose:
*     To access a sequence of NDFs and an associated factor.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_NDFAB( CNAME, USEEXT, NDFNAM, MAXNDF, FACNAM,
*                      INGRP, FACTS, NNDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine accesses a sequence of NDFs, using the NDG system
*     whose ADAM parameter name NDFNAM.  An NDG group is returned
*     containing the NDF names.  A maximum number of NDFs MAXNDF may be
*     returned. The actual number of NDFs is returned in NNDF.  After
*     the NDFs have been accessed an attempt is made to get associated
*     "exposure" factors. These may be looked for in the NDF extensions
*     if the USEEXT argument is TRUE, otherwise the user will be
*     prompted for the values. If the user is prompted then they will
*     have the chance to return an exact number of factors or just one
*     (which will be used to default all the factors). The parameter
*     used for this is FACNAM.
*
*     If USEEXT is true then the factors accessed from the NDF
*     extensions will depend on value of the CNAME argument. This should
*     be the name of a valid sub-type of the .TIMES structure (e.g. DARK
*     or FLASH).

*  Arguments:
*     CNAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the sub-component of the .TIMES structure of the
*        NDF's CCDPACK extension which contains the factor to access.
*        (Probably one of EXPOSURE DARK FLASH.)
*     USEEXT = LOGICAL (Given)
*         Whether to attempt to get the relative factors from the NDF
*     NDFNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The ADAM parameter name used to prompt for the NDFs.
*     MAXNDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maxiumum number of NDFs allowed.
*     FACNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The associated factor name.
*     INGRP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        An NDG identifier for the group of NDFs selected by the user.
*     FACTS( MAXNDF ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The factors returned from the user (defaults to one).
*     NNDF = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of NDF identifiers returned from user ( less than
*        MAXNDF)
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
