*  Name:
*     CCD1_MKHIS

*  Purpose:
*     Creates an optimised histogram of a data array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_MKHIS( ITYPE, ARRAY, NPIX, BAD, MINBIN, NHIST, HIST,
*                      MODE, PEAK, NBIN, ZERO, WIDTH, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine calls CCD1_MKHI<T> to produce a histogram of the
*     input data of type ITYPE> The histogram is formed in such a way
*     that at least MINBIN values are present in the peak counts bin.
*     The first estimate of the histogram is formed using NHIST
*     elements. If more than MINBIN counts are present in at least one
*     bin then no further action is taken, if less than is number of
*     counts are present in the peak bin then the histogram is rebinned
*     to increase the number count until MINBIN is exceeded. On exit
*     the number of bins used to form the histogram is returned
*     together with the bin number which contains the peak count level
*     and the width (in data values) of the bin and a zero point. The
*     original data values are related to the bin number (starting at 1
*     up to NBIN) by
*
*        VALUE = (NBIN-1)*WIDTH+ZERO

*  Arguments:
*     ITYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The input data type. Must be one of the HDS non-complex
*        numerics.
*     ARRAY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to input array of values.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of elements in input array.
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the input array contains BAD values or not.
*     MINBIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The minimum number of counts which may be in the peak bin on
*        exit.
*     NHIST = INTEGER (Given)
*        Size of the input histogram array. This value is used as the
*        starting point for forming the histogram. The size of this
*        should be sufficient to ensure that the histogram is initially
*        oversampled (so that the MINBIN criterion is NOT meet) if it is
*        vital that the MINBIN count level is just meet.
*     HIST( NHIST ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The histogram of the input data values.
*     MODE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the bin which contains the peak count.
*     PEAK = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of counts in the modal bin.
*     NBIN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of bins used to form the histogram (i.e. size of
*        HIST on exit).
*     ZERO = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The zero point of the histogram in data values.
*     WIDTH = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The width of a bin of the histogram in data values.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
