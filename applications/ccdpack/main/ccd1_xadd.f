      SUBROUTINE CCD1_XADD( PARAM, LOC, NAME, MODIFY, CANCEL, VALUE,
     :                      EXISTS, FRMEXT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_XADD

*  Purpose:
*     Enters a corroborated value to a HDS named object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_XADD( PARAM, LOC, NAME, MODIFY, CANCEL, VALUE, EXISTS,
*                     FRMEXT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine accesses a double precision user supplied value
*     through the ADAM parameter PARAM. If no value is supplied
*     indicated by a null return) then the status is annulled and the
*     routine continues. The routine then checks to see if the NAMEd
*     item of the object pointed to by LOC already exists. If it does
*     then no further action is taken unless the MODIFY value is set
*     true. If MODIFY is true then the new value is written to the NAMEd
*     object. If the object does not exist then the new value (if
*     it has been supplied) is written. A message is issued if a
*     modification has occurred.
*
*     On exit the value which is already in the named object or which is
*     entered by this routine is returned in VALUE. If no value exists
*     or is entered then EXISTS is false, if the value exists and is
*     unmodified then FRMEXT is true, otherwise it is false.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the ADAM parameter which is to be used to specify
*        the value.
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Locator to parent object of the object which contains the value
*        or which is to contain the value.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Name of the object which contains the value or which is to
*        contain the value. Note that the storage object is located by a
*        combination of LOC and NAME.
*     MODIFY = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true then an existing value in the storage object may be
*        overwritten.
*     CANCEL = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true then the parameter association will be cancelled.
*     VALUE = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The value entered into the extension. This is the current value
*        (if one exists and modify is false), or the value obtained from
*        the environment.
*     EXISTS = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether or not the extension item exists after this routine is
*        called.
*     FRMEXT = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether the value was in the NDF extension already and is
*        unmodified or not.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
