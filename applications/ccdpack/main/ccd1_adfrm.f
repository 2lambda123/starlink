      SUBROUTINE CCD1_ADFRM( FSET, FSET2, DOMAIN, ROT, FITROT, NCARD,
     :                       IPFITS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_ADFRM

*  Purpose:
*     Add a new frame to a frameset.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_ADFRM( FSET, FSET2, DOMAIN, ROT, FITROT, NCARD, IPFITS,
*                      STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine takes two framesets FSET and FSET2, and adds the
*     Current frame from FSET2 on to FSET.  To do this it locates a
*     frame in FSET with the same Domain as the Base frame of FSET2,
*     and adds the Current frame of FSET2 to it using the mapping
*     between the Base and Current frames of FSET2.  Any frames
*     with the same domain as DOMAIN are removed from FSET.  The
*     Current frame of FSET remains the same (unless it has been
*     removed by the previous rule, in which case it becomes the
*     newly added frame).  The newly added frame will be the last
*     (highest-index) frame in the FSET.
*
*     A couple of modifications to this mapping may be made: if the
*     ROT argument is non-zero a further rotation will be added to
*     it, and if FITROT is non-blank a rotation given by the value
*     (in degrees) of the FITS header card with the keyword given
*     by FITROT is also added.
*
*     This routine only works on two-dimensional frames (because of
*     the rotation business).

*  Arguments:
*     FSET = INTEGER (Given)
*        AST pointer to the frameset to which a frame is to be added.
*     FSET2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        AST pointer to the frameset from which a frame is to be added.
*     DOMAIN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The AST Domain to use in joining the framesets.  Both FSET and
*        FSET2 must contain a frame in this domain.
*     ROT = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        A fixed rotation angle in degrees to be added to the mapping.
*     FITROT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of a FITS header card giving an additional angle in
*        degrees to be added to the mapping.
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of cards in the mapped FITS character array.
*     IPFITS = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to the mapped array of FITS header cards.  These
*        must be mapped as _CHAR*80.  Not accessed if FITROT is blank
*        or NCARD is zero.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
