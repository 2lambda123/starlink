      SUBROUTINE CCD1_UNTMP( ID, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_UNTMP

*  Purpose:
*     Unmaps temporary workspace created by CCD1_MKTMP and mapped in by
*     CCD1_MPTMP.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_UNTMP( ID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Use this routine when unmapping in non-NDF temporary disk-file
*     space allocated by CCD1_MKTMP and mapped by CCD1_MPTMP. If the
*     identifier is replaced by -1 then all currently mapped in
*     workspace is unmaped.

*  Arguments:
*     ID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier to the workspace which is to be unmapped.
*        (Returned by CCD1_MPTMP). If this is -1 then all workspace
*        is unmapped.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - this routine works regardless of the STATUS and reports no
*     errors. This routine should not be called before CCD1_MKTMP which
*     initialises the common block - unless status is set.
