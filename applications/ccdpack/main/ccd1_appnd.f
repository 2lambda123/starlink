      SUBROUTINE CCD1_APPND( STR1, STR2, LEN2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_APPND

*  Purpose:
*     Copies one string into another.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_APPND( STR1, STR2, LEN2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The string STR1 (or as much of it as there is room for) is
*     copied into the part of STR2 beginning at position LEN2+1.
*     LEN2 is updated to indicate the final length of STR2 after
*     this operation.

*  Arguments:
*     STR1  =  CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Input string to be copied into the string that is to be
*        modified.
*     STR2  =  CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        String to be updated by adding the contents of STR1.
*     LEN2  =  INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The current position of the last non-blank character in STR2.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Check inherited global status.

*  Get the length of the destination string
      SIZE2 = LEN( STR2 )

*  Get length of string to copy, truncate the possible number of
*  characters appended to lie within the maximum length of output
*  string.
      SIZE1 = MIN( LEN( STR1 ), SIZE2 - LEN2 )

*  Append STR1 to STR2.
      STR2( LEN2 + 1 : LEN2 + SIZE1 ) = STR1( 1 : SIZE1 )

*  Update the length of STR2.
      LEN2 = LEN2 + SIZE1
