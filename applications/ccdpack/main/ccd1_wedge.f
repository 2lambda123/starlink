      SUBROUTINE CCD1_WEDGE( IMETH, NEL, BOUNDS, NENT, MAXWEI, W,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_WEDGE

*  Purpose:
*     To produce line of weights, using a set of column or row
*     pairs to define the extent of the regions to produce weights for.
*     The weights are such that they are maximum in the centre of a
*     line of data between the given columns or rows.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_WEDGE( IMETH, NEL, BOUNDS, NENT, MAXWEI, W, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The range of the weights line is scanned once. Array elements
*     lying within the bounds specified in the BOUNDS array are given
*     a weight using the basis of the extent of the present section.
*     The weight can be linear, exponential or constant, so
*     weight = 1-2*abs(distance from centre of section)/range
*     or
*     weight = exp( -abs(distance from centre of section).
*     or
*     weight = const
*     The sum of weights for each section of a line has the same
*     total weight. Any number of bounds ranges may be specified. Note
*     that all of the output array values except those within the given
*     columns or rows are left at their input value.

*  Arguments:
*     IMETH = INTEGER (Given)
*        The weighting method, can have the values
*           0: constant
*           1: linear weighting
*           2: exponential weighting.
*     NEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of elements in output weights array.
*     BOUNDS( NENT ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The array specifying the ranges of columns or rows to be
*        weighted.  BOUNDS(2*I -1) and BOUNDS(2*I) contain the first
*        and last columns or rows to be precessed in range I.
*     NENT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of entries in BOUNDS.
*     MAXWEI = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The maximum sum of weights in each line of data in a section.
*        (note that this is used to balance the weights between edge
*        areas, a larger central weight, or larger sumof weights
*        in one strip unfairly biases sloped fits).
*     W( NEL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The output array which contains the weights for the data
*        within the given columns.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - This routine is intended for use in weighting bias regions in
*     CCD frames.
*     - The weights are produced in double precision.
