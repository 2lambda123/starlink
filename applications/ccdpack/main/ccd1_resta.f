*  Name:
*     CCD1_RESTA

*  Purpose:
*     Remove NDFs which have been processed from valid list.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      SUBROUTINE CCD1_RESTA( FTYPES, NNDF, GIDIN, ORIG, DEBICR, DARKCR,
*                             FLASCR, FLATCR, VALID, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine attempts to remove NDFs from a list which have
*     already been processed in some way and are represented by
*     another occurence of the same data. Typically this would be useful
*     when a automated reduction has failed (due to a lack of resources)
*     and it is expected that a new reduction should start from the
*     place that the last failed. The way that later occurences of the
*     data are identified is by looking for the name of the original NDF
*     in the extension of the later NDFs and by using the information
*     which indicates how the data has been processed. It is assumed
*     that the "standard" application route has been used
*
*        MAKEBIAS, DEBIAS, MAKECAL(DARK), CALCOR(DARK), MAKECAL(FLASH),
*        CALCOR(FLASH), MAKEFLAT, FLATCOR
*
*     So that the NDF which is furthest along this chain will be the
*     starting point for a new reduction.

*  Arguments:
*     FTYPES( 2, NNDF ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        List of the input NDF frame and filter types.
*     NNDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of input NDFs.
*     GIDIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        GRP identifier to the group of input NDFs that the information
*        has been derived from.
*     ORIG( NNDF ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The names of the "original" NDFs which started a processing
*        chain. This name is passed through applications unchanged.
*     DEBICR( NNDF ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the corresponding NDF has been debiassed or not.
*     DARKCR( NNDF ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the corresponding NDF has been dark corrected or not.
*     FLASCR( NNDF ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the corresponding NDF has been flash corrected or not.
*     FLATCR( NNDF ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the corresponding NDF has been flatfielded or not.
*     VALID( NNDF ) = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Mask of which entries in FTYPES are to be used. On exit any
*        extra NDFs which should be ignored are also flagged.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Look for all the occurences of the original file names.  The
*  precedence rule for processing is:- debicr - darkcr - flascr -
*  flatcr.  The highest ranked NDF in a group of NDFs with the same
*  'Original' file name and the same types etc. will be chosen as the
*  current representative. Using ranks based on a power of two allows
*  finer discrimination between divergent processing chains (say if two
*  NDFs have been flatfielded, and are the same then either the first
*  one will be chosen or the one which has had the most processing
*  performed to it -- possibly it one has also been dark count
*  corrected or pre-flash corrected -- preserving the NDF with most
*  'entropy' must be correct as this requires the most effort to
*  reproduce). If an NDF has been flatfielded exclude it as well and
