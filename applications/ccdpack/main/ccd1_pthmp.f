      SUBROUTINE CCD1_PTHMP( FSETS, PATH, NSTEP, DMNS, MAP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_PTHMP

*  Purpose:
*     Generate an AST mapping from a path through a graph.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_PTHMP( FSETS, PATH, NSTEP, DMNS, MAP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine uses a number of steps through a graph of conversions
*     between AST framesets to come up with a mapping from the first
*     frameset in the first edge of the path to the second frameset in
*     the final edge of the path.  As a special case, if the initial
*     and terminal framesets are the same, a unit mapping is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     FSETS( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Array of pointers to AST framesets into which the (1,*) and
*        (2,*) elements of the PATH nodes index.
*     PATH( 4, NSTEP ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        A set of edges forming a connected graph between the nodes
*        representing the framesets in the FSETS array.  The from-
*        and to- node numbers are in positions (1,*) and (2,*).
*        Position (3,*) gives the index into DMNS of the domain in
*        which alignment must be made.  PATH(2,N-1) must be equal
*        to PATH(1,N) for N = 2..NSTEP.
*     NSTEP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of PATH.
*     DMNS( * ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Array of domains in which alignment may occur; indexed into by
*        PATH( 3, * ).
*     MAP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        AST pointer to a mapping between the Current frame of the
*        the first frameset in the path to the Current frame of the
*        last frameset in the path.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
