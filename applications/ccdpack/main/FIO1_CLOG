*  Name:
*     CCD1_CLOG

*  Purpose:
*     CCDPACK log file system common block

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of module:
*     Include file for declaring common block.

*  Description:
*     CCDPACK log file system include file. This file declares the
*     common block  /CCD1_CLOG/CCD1_LOGFD,CCD1_ILEVL,CCD1_BUFF, which
*     controls the echoing of any output strings to the logfile and
*     terminal. THIS VERSION USES FIO and PSX.
*
*  Notes:
*     - This version is designed for use on machines which do not
*        support the ICL/ADAM logging system. It uses FIO and PSX open
*        and control the file, and to perform the date/time stamping.
*     - includes the MSG system parameters to define the size of the
*       character buffer
