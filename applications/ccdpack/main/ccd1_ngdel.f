      SUBROUTINE CCD1_NGDEL( GRP, INDEX, VERB, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_NGDEL

*  Purpose:
*     Delete an NDF given its position in an NDG group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_NGDEL( GRP, INDEX, VERB, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine will delete an NDF structure from disk, given its
*     position within an NDG group.  If its NDF identifier is already
*     available to the calling code, the NDF_DELET can be used, but
*     if the NDF is not currently open, this will erase it without
*     the calling code having to reopen it.
*
*     This routine checks to see whether it is in native (NDF) format
*     first, and also whether it represents a whole NDF or just a slice.
*     If it is a whole native NDF, then it opens it and calls NDF_DELET.
*     If not, then opening it would have a high overhead and would also
*     be useless, since it would be creating a new temporary NDF on disk 
*     only to delete it; in this case no action is taken.

*  Arguments:
*     GRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDG identifier for the NDG group referencing the NDFs.
*        Note this must be a proper NDG group and not just a GRP group
*        containing the NDF names, since NDG_GTSUP is called on its
*        elements.
*     INDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the element in GRP to be erased.
*     VERB = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If true, a message is logged through the CCDPACK logging system
*        for each NDF which is actually deleted.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
