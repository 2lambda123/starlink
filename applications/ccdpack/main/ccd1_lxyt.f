      SUBROUTINE CCD1_LXYT( ARRIN, NDEC, NREC, NVAL, TR, ARROUT,
     :                      STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_LXYT

*  Purpose:
*     Transforms the X and Y positions of an array using a linear
*     transformation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_LXYT( ARRIN, NDEC, NREC, NVAL, TR, ARROUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine transforms the first two columns within the the ARRIN
*     array using a linear transformation whose coefficients are
*     specified by the TR array. The output array contains the
*     transformed positions and any other values which are present in
*     the input array.

*  Arguments:
*     ARRIN( NDEC, NVAL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Array which contains the positions which require
*        transformation.
*     NDEC = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension of the ARRIN array when it was declared in the
*        calling routine.
*     NREC = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of records (rows) in ARRIN which are to transformed.
*     NVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of values (columns) in each record of ARRIN.
*     TR( 6 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The transformation coefficients. The transformation is:
*
*        XDASH = TR( 1 ) + TR( 2 ) * X + TR( 3 ) * Y
*        YDASH = TR( 4 ) + TR( 5 ) * X + TR( 6 ) * Y
*     ARROUT( NREC, NVAL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The output array which contains the transformed positions and a
*        copy of any other data which was present in ARRIN.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The linear transform used by this routines is:
*        XDASH = TR( 1 ) + TR( 2 ) * X + TR( 3 ) * Y
*        YDASH = TR( 4 ) + TR( 5 ) * X + TR( 6 ) * Y
