      SUBROUTINE CCD1_DRAWA( PLOT, IDS, POS, NMARK, NVAL, MTYPE, 
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_DRAWA

*  Purpose:
*     Draws markers at the given positions on an AST Plot.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_DRAWA( PLOT, IDS, POS, NMARK, NVAL, MTYPE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine draws markers of the type decided by MTYPE at the
*     positions determined by the X and Y arrays. If MTYPE is less than
*     zero then the values in ID are plotted at the positions instead
*     of a `normal' marker.

*  Arguments:
*     PLOT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The AST identifier for the Plot object into which plots are
*        to be made.
*     IDS( NMARK ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifiers of the X and Y data. These values are plotted
*        at the X and Y positions if the marker type is less than zero.
*        If MTYPE is greater than zero this array is not used.
*     POS( NMARK, NVAL ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The positions at which the markers are to be plotted.  For 
*        point number IMARK, the X coordinate is POS( IMARK, 1 ) and
*        the Y coordinate is POS( IM, 2 ).
*     NMARK = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of markers to be plotted.
*     NVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the POS array.  Must be at least 2.
*     MTYPE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The type of the markers to be drawn. This corresponds to the
*        PGPLOT marker number.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
