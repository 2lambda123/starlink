      REAL FUNCTION CCD1_RNORM( A, B, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_RNORM

*  Purpose:
*     To return a pseudo-random real number taken from a normal
*     ( Gaussian ) distribution, with mean A and standard deviation B.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = RANNORM( A, B, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine calls the PDA library function PDA_DRNOR to return the
*     pseudo random number.  Before the first call of this routine,
*     PDA_DSTART must have been called to initialise the random number
*     generator.

*  Arguments:
*     A = REAL (Given)
*        The mean of the normal distribution.
*     B = REAL (Given)
*        The standard deviation of the distribution.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     RANORM = REAL
*        An random number from the normal distribution, with mean A and
*        standard deviation B.

*     19-SEP-1996 (PDRAPER):
*        Now uses PDA routine instead of NAG routine.
