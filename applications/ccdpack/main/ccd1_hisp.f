*  Name:
*     CCD1_HISP

*  Purpose:
*     Locates a percentile value in a histogram.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_HISP( HIST, NBIN, ZERO, WIDTH, PERCEN, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine locates the value which corresponds to a given
*     percentile value in a histogram. The value returned is an
*     interpolation of the bins around the given position.

*  Arguments:
*     HIST( NBIN ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The histogram of counts.
*     NBIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of bins in the histogram.
*     ZERO = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The zero point of the values which actually correspond to the
*        histogram bins.
*     WIDTH = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The width of a bin in data values.
*     PERCEN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The percentile position in the data which is to be evaluated.
*     VALUE = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The interpolated percentile value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The histogram bins are related to the original values by
*
*         ( BIN_NUMBER - 1 ) * WIDTH + ZERO

*  Global Constants:

*  Arguments Given:
      INTEGER NBIN
      INTEGER HIST( NBIN )

*  Arguments Returned:

*  Local Variables:
      DOUBLE PRECISION NEED      ! Count value that corresponds to
                                 ! percentile position
      DOUBLE PRECISION SUM       ! Sum of counts in histogram

      DOUBLE PRECISION LAST      ! Last bin count

*.

*  Check inherited global status.

*  Sum the counts in the histogram.
      SUM = 0.0D0
      DO 1 I = 1, NBIN
         SUM = SUM + DBLE( HIST( I ) )

*  Calculate how many counts the percentile position corresponds to.
      NEED = SUM * PERCEN

*  Re-initialise the sum of counts.
      SUM = 0.0D0

*  Initialise last bin count sum.

*  Loop until the count sum exceeds the sum which is required. The
*  previous bin and this bin are used to interpolate the actual
*  bin fraction which corresponds to the required percentile.

         SUM = SUM + DBLE( HIST( I ) )
         IF ( SUM .GE. NEED ) THEN

*  Located the position. Interpolate value from the last position
*  to this position, to get fractional bin offset.
            VALUE = ( NEED - LAST ) / ( SUM - LAST )

*  Determine the actual data value this position corresponds to.
            VALUE = ( DBLE( I - 1 ) + VALUE ) * WIDTH + ZERO

*  Remember this count for use in interpolation.
