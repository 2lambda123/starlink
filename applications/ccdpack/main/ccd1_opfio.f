      SUBROUTINE CCD1_OPFIO( FNAME, ACMODE, FORM, RECSZ, FD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_OPFIO

*  Purpose:
*     Opens a sequential file - given its name.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_OPFIO( FNAME, ACMODE, FORM, RECSZ, FD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine opens a sequential file of name FNAME.  If the file
*     exists and is opened for write access and the open fails then an
*     attempt to a previous file is made. If this is successful another
*     attempt to open the file for write is made, this facility is
*     intended for UNIX based system with no file versions. If this
*     fails then a error is reported etc. The file opened should be
*     closed using FIO_CLOSE.

*  Arguments:
*     FNAME = CHARACTER *( * ) (Given)
*        Name of the file to be opened
*     ACMODE = CHARACTER *( * ) (Given)
*        Expression giving the required access mode.
*        Valid modes are: 'READ', 'WRITE', 'UPDATE' and 'APPEND'.
*        For details, see FIO_OPEN.
*     FORM = CHARACTER *( * )(Given)
*         Expression giving the required formatting of the file.
*         Valid formats are: 'FORTRAN', 'LIST', 'NONE' and
*         'UNFORMATTED'. For details, see FIO_OPEN.
*     RECSZ = INTEGER (Given)
*         Expression giving the maximum record size in bytes.
*         Set it to zero if the Fortran default is required.
*     FD = INTEGER (Returned)
*         Variable to contain the file descriptor.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*         Global status value

*  History:
*     25-MAY-1989 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     11-MAY-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Extracted from AIF and renamed for PISA use. Updated
*        prologue.
*     18-MAR-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Added checks for file opened for write access which fails
*        (on UNIX system).
*     12-MAY-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Made into a CCDPACK subroutine. Removed parameter access mode.
