      SUBROUTINE CCD1_DECL2( LINE, LINNUM, HAVIND, NUMVAL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_DECL2

*  Purpose:
*     Decodes a line of characters returning the number of values after
*     the index.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_DECL2( LINE, LINNUM, HAVIND, NUMVAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine decodes a line of characters into words.  The line
*     must only contains words separated by blanks (lines read in by
*     CCD1_RDLIN are recommended).  The number of words are counted. If
*     at least one word is present then HAVIND is set true and a index
*     value is assumed present. If more than 1 word is present the
*     excess is returned as NUMVAL. This routine is expected to be used
*     in determining the memory requirements to decode the data into its
*     numeric values.

*  Arguments:
*     LINE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Line of blank separated words to be decoded into words.
*     LINNUM = INTEGER (Given)
*        A line number to be issued with error messages.
*     HAVIND = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Set true it at least one value is present.
*     NUMVA = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of values after the index.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
