      SUBROUTINE CCD1_FTGET( NCARD, IPFITS, SCARD, NAME, VALUE, ICARD,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_FTGET

*  Purpose:
*     Get FITS value as a character string.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_FTGET( NCARD, IPFITS, SCARD, NAME, VALUE, ICARD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine attempts to retrieve from a buffer containing a 
*     mapped FITS extension the value of a header card with a given
*     keyword.  If no matching header card is found then an error 
*     message is output and STATUS is set.
*
*     The value returned is a string representation of the value 
*     requested.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of card images in the buffer.
*     IPFITS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a buffer containing the header card images.
*     SCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from where the search will begin.  This
*        is needed because the headers make contain a dummy header
*        prior to an extension.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the keyword whose value is required.  This may be
*        a compound name to handle hierarchical keywords, and it has
*        the form keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  The maximum number of
*        keywords per FITS card is 20.  Comparisons are performed in
*        uppercase and blanks are removed.  Each keyword must be no
*        longer than 8 characters.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The value of the keyword.
*     CARD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the card containing the named keyword.
*        If the card could not be found this is set to zero.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Notes:
*     This routine is passed a pointer to the FITS buffer rather than 
*     the pointer itself.  This is so that the calling routine does not
*     need to worry about the rather ugly business of passing character
*     lengths by value to the routine (this routine does that instead).
