      SUBROUTINE CCD1_ACHAN( FD, OPTIONS, CHAN, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_ACHAN

*  Purpose:
*     Create an AST channel.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_ACHAN( FD, OPTIONS, CHAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates an AST channel for use within CCDPACK using 
*     a given valid FIO file descriptor.  It is a wrapper for AST_CHANNEL 
*     whose purpose is to shield the calling routine from knowledge of 
*     the source and sink routines and global variables required to 
*     make this work.

*  Arguments:
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        FIO file descriptor of an open file to be used for the channel.
*     OPTIONS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A character string containing an optional comma-separated list
*        of attribute assignments for passing to AST_CHANNEL.
*     CHAN = INTEGER (Returned)
*        AST pointer to a new channel reading/writing from the file 
*        referred to by FD.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Restrictions:
*     As currently implemented, only one AST channel created by this 
*     routine may be in use at once.  No check is performed that the 
*     channel is not already in use.
