*  Name:
*     CCD1_MVDAT

*  Purpose:
*     Move data from an image plane into a stack, applying corrections.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_MVDAT( TYPE, ADJUST, BAD, ISVAR, LBIN, UBIN, NY, DATIN,
*                      VARIN, I1, I2, IZ, SCALE, DSCALE, ZERO, DZERO,
*                      ORIG, LBOUT, UBOUT, OUT, NBAD, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine moves values from a range of columns in an array
*     (regarded as a 2-dimensional image) into a corresponding area in
*     a selected plane of a 3-dimensional "stack".  At the same time,
*     it optionally applies scale factor and zero point corrections to
*     data values according to the formula:
*
*        OUT = ( DATIN - ORIG ) * SCALE + ZERO
*
*     The routine may also be used to generate corrected variance
*     values as output, in which case the appropriate statistical error
*     propagation formula is used.

*  Arguments:
*     TYPE = CHARA* ( * ) (Given)
*        The numeric type of the values to be processed; '_REAL' or
*        '_DOUBLE' (in upper case). The routine will return without
*        action unless one of these two strings is supplied.
*     ADJUST = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether scale factor and zero point corrections are to be
*        applied; if .FALSE. is specified, then the output values will
*        not have these corrections applied.
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether it is necessary to check for the presence of bad
*        values in the input data (and variance, if given).
*     ISVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether the output values should be variances (as opposed to
*        data values).
*     LBIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Lower bound on the first dimension of the input image.
*     UBIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Upper bound on the first dimension of the input image.
*     NY = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second dimension size of the input image.
*     DATIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the input image, which should have dimensions
*        (LBIN:UBIN,NY). Its data type should be as specified via the
*        TYPE argument.
*     VARIN = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to an input image containing the variance values,
*        which should have dimensions (LBIN:UBIN,NY). Its data type
*        should be as specified via the TYPE argument.
*     I1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Lower bound on the range of columns to be moved (must lie in
*        the range LBIN to UBIN inclusive).
*     I2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Upper bound on the range of columns to be moved (must lie in
*        the range LBIN to UBIN inclusive and be at least equal to I1).
*     IZ = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of the plane in the output image stack into which the
*        results are to be placed.
*     SCALE = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Scale factor correction to be applied. This is only used if
*        ADJUST is .TRUE..
*     DSCALE = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Standard error on the scale factor correction.  This is only
*        used if (ADJUST.AND.ISVAR) is .TRUE..
*     ZERO = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Zero point correction to be applied. This is only used if
*        ADJUST is .TRUE..
*     DZERO = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Standard error on the zero point correction.  This is only
*        used if (ADJUST.AND.ISVAR) is .TRUE..
*     ORIG = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Origin value to be used in making the correction. This should
*        be chosen so that the errors on the scale factor and zero
*        point corrections are expected to be un-correlated. This is
*        only used if ADJUST is .TRUE..
*     LBOUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Lower bound on the first dimension of the output stack (must
*        not exceed I1).
*     UBOUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Upper bound on the first dimension of the output stack (must
*        not be less than I2).
*     OUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the stack into which the results are to be
*        inserted. This should have dimensions (LBOUT:UBOUT,NY,*). The
*        stack itself will be modified (although the pointer will not
*        be), the region affected being (I1:I2,1:NY,IZ:IZ) - other
*        parts of this stack are returned unchanged. The final
*        dimension size of the stack must be at least equal to IZ and
*        its data type should be as specified via the TYPE argument.
*     NBAD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of bad values generated amongst the output values.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
