      SUBROUTINE CCD1_CKFLA( IDS, NNDF, FILTER, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_CKFLA

*  Purpose:
*     Checks that the NDFs are suitable for combination into a flatfield
*     master.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_CKFLA( IDS, NNDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine looks for frame types and filters in the input
*     NDFs and checks that each type is indeed a recognised flatfield
*     type. Frames with different types are reported as are frames with
*     no type if at least one frame has a proper type. The flatfields
*     are also checked to see that the filter types are the same.
*     If a single filter type is found then it is returned in FILTER
*     otherwise FILTER is returned as ' '.

*  Arguments:
*     IDS( NNDF ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifiers of the "flatfields".
*     NNDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of NDFs given.
*     FILTER = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The filter type of the NDFs. Blank if no consensus if found.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - this routine is used as part of the "automated" extensions
*     added to CCDPACK as of version 2.0.
