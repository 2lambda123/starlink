      SUBROUTINE CCD1_GISEQ( FIRST, INCRE, NELEM, ARRAY, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_GISEQ

*  Purpose:
*     Generates a sequential array of integer values.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_GISEQ( FIRST, INCRE, NELEM, ARRAY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates a sequence of integer values which in writes
*     into the array ARRAY. The number of elements in the array is
*     determined by the NELEM argument. The sequence of numbers written
*     into the array is determined by the FIRST and INCRE
*     arguments. Basically the first value written into the array is
*     FIRST, the second FIRST+INCRE etc. until the array is filled.

*  Arguments:
*     FIRST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The starting value of the sequence to be written into the
*        array.
*     INCRE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The increment between successive values which are written into
*        the array.
*     NELEM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The actual number of elements in ARRAY.
*     ARRAY( NELEM ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        On output this array contains the sequence of integers:
*        FIRST, FIRST+INCRE, FIRST+2*INCRE .... FIRST+(NELEM-1)*INCRE
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
