      SUBROUTINE CCD1_LOCS3( LIST, NCOL, NROW, CCOL1, CCOL2, CHECK,

*  Name:
*     CCD1_LOCS3

*  Purpose:
*     Locates the occurances of two strings in a 2D list.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_LOCS3( LIST, NCOL, NROW, CCOL1, CCOL2, CHECK, VALUE1,
*                      VALUE2, LOCAT, NLOC, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine looks at the values in the 2D character dimension
*     LIST( NCOL, NROW ) in columns CCOL1 and CCOL2 . It only looks in
*     those rows which are flagged as true in the CHECK array. If it
*     locates a pair of matching values the row number is entered into
*     LOCAT and NLOC is incremented by one. So on exit a list of
*     pointers to the entries in which VALUE1 and VALUE2 are present is
*     output.

*  Arguments:
*     LIST( NCOL, NROW ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Array of character values which are too be checked for
*        occurances of the string VALUE.
*     NCOL = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension of LIST.
*     NROW = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second dimension of LIST.
*     CCOL1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        First column number to look for matching values.
*     CCOL2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second column number to look for matching values.
*     CHECK( NROW ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Logical mask of rows to be checked for string occurance.
*     VALUE1 = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The first value which is to be located.
*     VALUE2 = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The second value which is to be located.
*     LOCAT( NROW ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        List of the row numbers which contain both VALUE1 and VALUE2
*        in CCOL1 and CCOL2 respectively.
*     NLOC = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of occurances of VALUE1 and VALUE2 located.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
