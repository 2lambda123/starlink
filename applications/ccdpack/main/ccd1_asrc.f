      SUBROUTINE CCD1_ASRC( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_ASRC

*  Purpose:
*     Source routine for use by AST Channels.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_ASRC( STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine implements a source routine which has to be passed to
*     the AST Channel construction routines (AST_CHANNEL, AST_FITSCHAN)
*     in order to do input/output on AST objects to a file.  It uses FIO 
*     to do the input, via a file descriptor held in a common block.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Usage:
*     CHAN = AST_CHANNEL( CCD1_ASRC, SINK, OPTIONS, STATUS )

*  If end of file was reached, tell that to the AST system.
