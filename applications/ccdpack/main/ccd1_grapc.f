      SUBROUTINE CCD1_GRAPC( GRAPH, NEDGES, START, QUEUE, BEEN, COMPL,

*  Name:
*     CCD1_GRAPC

*  Purpose:
*     Tests the properties of a graph, represented as a series of
*     edges.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_GRAPC( GRAPH, NEDGES, START, BEEN, QUEUE, COMPL,
*                      CYCLIC, SUBGRP, NEWED, NNODE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine performs a search of a graph which is represented by
*     its edges. The search of the graph is performed starting at an
*     edge which selected by the caller. The returns are BEEN which
*     represents which nodes the search visited (positions within BEEN
*     are selected by the node numbers in GRAPH, so BEEN should be large
*     enough to contain the largest node number as an offset). COMPL
*     which is true if all the nodes are visited during the search, the
*     graph is then connected and complete. If the number of edges of
*     the graph (or sub-graph if not complete) exceed the number of
*     edges used for the SPAN then the graph is cyclic and CYCLIC is
*     returned true.

*  Arguments:
*     GRAPH( 4, NEDGES ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The edges of the graph. The node numbers are held in elements
*        1 and 2.
*     NEDGES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of edges in the graph.
*     START = INTEGER (Given)
*        The offset into GRAPH which is the edge to start the span at.
*     QUEUE( * ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace to hold the queue of nodes still be visited.
*     BEEN( * ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Array of flags indicating which nodes have been visited. The
*        index into this array are those of the node numbers, so this
*        array should be large enough to be indexed by the largest node
*        number.
*     COMPL = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If all the nodes of the input graph are visited then the graph
*        is complete and this flag is set true. Otherwise this flag is
*        set false.
*     CYCLIC = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If the number of edges connected to the nodes which are part of
*        the graph which is spanned exceeds the number of the span
*        itself then part of the graph must be cyclic. If this is so
*        then this flag is set true. Otherwise it is set false.
*     SUBGRP( 4, * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The edge information of the spanning sub-graph which is
*        produced from the search starting at edge START.
*     NEWED = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of edges in the output sub-graph (second dimension).
*     NNODE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of nodes in the output sub-graph
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
