*  Name:
*     ccdMall

*  Purpose:
*     C wrapper for fortran CCD1_MALL routine.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Arguments:
*     type = char *
*        HDS type of memory to allocate, as a null-terminated string.
*     size = int
*        Number of elements of type type to allocate.
*     status = int
*        The global status.

*  Return Value:
*     A pointer to a block of memory which will hold size elements of
*     type type.  This pointer has been registered with the CCDPACK
*     memory allocation machinery (and a fortiori the CNF memory
*     allocation machinery) and so must be deallocated using CCD1_MFREE.
*     The pointer returned is a C pointer, and thus suitable for direct
*     use by C code.  If it is to be used by Fortran code it must
*     be processed with the function cnfFptr.
