      SUBROUTINE CCD1_CKTYP( IDS, NNDF, TYPE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_CKTYP

*  Purpose:
*     Checks the frame types of a list of NDFs.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_CKTYP( IDS, NNDF, TYPE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine looks for frame types in the input NDFs and checks
*     that each type is the same as the given one. NDFs with a type
*     which is different from that given (case independent) are reported
*     (using the messages system) frames with no type (or extension
*     are not checked).

*  Arguments:
*     IDS( NNDF ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The input NDF identifiers.
*     NNDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of NDFs given.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The expected frame type.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - this routine is used as part of the "automated" extensions
*     added to CCDPACK as of version 2.0.
