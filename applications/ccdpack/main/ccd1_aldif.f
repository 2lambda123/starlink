      SUBROUTINE CCD1_ALDIF( D1, N1, D2, N2, DIF, DIFMAX, DIFMIN,
     :                       STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_ALDIF

*  Purpose:
*     Forms an array of all possible differences between two arrays.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_ALDIF( D1, N1, D2, N2, DIF, DIFMAX, DIFMIN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine performs all the possible intercomparisons between
*     two arrays of double precision data, forming the difference
*     between the first array and the second data data values. The
*     differences are returned together with the minimum and maximum
*     values.

*  Arguments:
*     D1( N1 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The first array of values.
*     N1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of values in first array.
*     D2( N2 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The second array of values.
*     N2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of values in second array.
*     DIF( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The differences in data values which result from the
*        intercomparison of D1 and D2. The array used to perform the
*        intercomparison is
*
*            index = 0
*            do i = 1, n1
*               do j = 1, n2
*                  index = index + 1
*                  dif( index ) = d1( i ) - d2( j )
*               end do
*            end do
*
*        so this mechanism should be used for referencing values.
*     DIFMAX = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Maximum difference.
*     DIFMIN = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Minimum difference.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
