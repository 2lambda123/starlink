*  Name:
*     CCD1_SOFF

*  Purpose:
*     Finds the positions which are consistent with a simple offset.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_SOFF( ERROR, MAXDIS, XIN1, YIN1, INDI1, NREC1, XIN2,
*                     YIN2, INDI2, NREC2, XDIST, YDIST, XRANK,
*                     CRANK, WORK1, XOUT1, YOUT1, XOUT2, YOUT2,

*  Description:
*     This routine performs the work for the CCDOFF application. It
*     uses two sets of X and Y positions and tries to determine the
*     most likely X and Y translation between the datasets. Returning
*     the positions which correspond to this match and the mean
*     transformation from the second positions to the first positions.
*     The method used is to look at a point from first list then offset
*     all the second list positions onto this position. A scan is then
*     made to determine the number of positions which now lie within a
*     box of side error of each of the first list positions. This
*     is repeated for every combination of position pairs between the
*     two lists. The most likely fit is then the translation that gave
*     the most correct positions. If a number of translations give the
*     same number of matches the one with the least deviation sum is
*     chosen.  Using this final section allows lists with few common
*     positions to be correctly selected.
*
*     Because of the inherent slowness of this process a
*     pre-calculating and sorting technique is used. This has the
*     dis-advantage of requiring large amounts of memory. The method is
*     basically to produce all the possible offsets between the two
*     lists then sort these according to value. The rows themselves are
*     then also ranked.  If both lists are resonably complete a
*     diagonal scan of the sorted array should always produce values of
*     around the correct value for matches.

*     ERROR = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The error in the positions.
*     MAXDIS = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The maximum acceptable displacement in pixels between two

*  History:
*     29-SEP-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     6-APR-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Added output index lists.
*     10-APR-1993 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed to use sorting, hopefully this will produce a useful
*        increase in processing speed.
*     16-SEP-1996 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed NAG calls to PDA calls.
*     7-SEP-1998 (PDRAPER):
*        Changed to output the XDIFF and YDIFF of the selected position,
*        rather than a mean derived from this. This caused the
*        completeness calcs to fail as the same positions are not
*        guaranteed. 
*     8-FEB-1999 (MBT):
*        Added input index lists.
*     30-MAR-1999 (MBT):
*        Modified to reject matches at greater displacements than 
*        MAXDIS.
*     30-JAN-2001 (MBT):
*        Fixed a (previously harmless) bug in input->output index 
*        indirection.
