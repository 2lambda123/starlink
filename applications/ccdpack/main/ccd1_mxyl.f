*  Name:
*     CCD1_MXYL

*  Purpose:
*     Merges a number of lists of X,Y positions into one set.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_MXYL( XIN, YIN, IDIN, OK, NXYIN, TR, NLST, XOUT,
*                     YOUT, IDOUT, NOUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine merges the positions in the XIN and YIN lists which
*     have the same identifiers, returning the merged positions in the
*     output lists. The input lists (XIN, YIN and IDIN ) are assumed to
*     consist of several lists merged into one. Each original list has
*     a transformation associated with it and the number of entries are
*     given in NXYIN. Only positions whose corresponding entries are
*     true in the OK array are processed.  Positions are merged by
*     locating all the positions with the same identifier and averaging
*     the X and Y values.

*  Arguments:
*     XIN( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        All input X positions appended into one list.
*     YIN( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        All input Y positions appended into one list.
*     IDIN( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifiers of XIN and YIN positions.
*     OK( * ) = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Array of flags indicating which elements of the inpout arrays
*        are to be ignored (i.e. these positions are ok for merging). 
*     NXYIN( NLST )  = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number entries for each input list, these values are
*        entered in the same order as the appended positions.
*     TR( 6, NLST ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Transformations to be applied to the X and Y positions before
*        merging.
*     NLST = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of lists appended into X,Y and ID.
*     XOUT( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Merged X positions for those values which were ok.
*     YOUT( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Merged Y positions for those values which were ok.
*     IDOUT( * ) = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifiers of the merged positions.
*     NOUT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of output positions.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
