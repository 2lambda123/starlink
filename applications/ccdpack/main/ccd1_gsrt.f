      SUBROUTINE CCD1_GSRT( IGRP, OGRP, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_GSRT

*  Purpose:
*     Sorts a GRP group.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_GSRT( IGRP, OGRP, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates a new GRP group which is a copy of an old one
*     but with the names sorted.  The case sensitivity attribute of
*     the group is respected.
*
*     The algorithm currently used is an insertion sort, which is not
*     very efficient; if the routine is likely to be used for
*     large or repeated sorts it ought to be recoded.

*  Arguments:
*     IGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*        The GRP identfier of the group to be sorted.
*     OGRP = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The GRP identifier of the sorted copy of the group.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
