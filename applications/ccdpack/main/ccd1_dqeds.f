      SUBROUTINE CCD1_DQEDS( XC, FJACC, LJC, IGO, IOPT, ROPT )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_DQEDS

*  Purpose:
*     Least squares function for scale factor and zero point
*     optimisation.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_DQEDS( XC, FJACC, LJC, IGO, IOPT, ROPT )

*  Description:
*     This is an instance of the DQEDEV service routine required by
*     the PDA library routine PDA_DQED which solves constrained
*     non-linear least-squares minimisation problems. It is configured
*     for use when determining an optimum set of logarithmic scale
*     factor and zero point corrections for a set of data arrays which
*     have been inter-compared in pairs and for which a set of individual
*     scale and zero differences have been found. The form of this routine
*     is governed by the requirements of the PDA routine.

*  Arguments:
*     XC( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Value of the unknowns for which residuals and derivatives are
*        required. The first CCD1_N/2 of these will be the logarithmic
*        scale factor corrections for each data array; the second
*        CCD1_N/2 will be the zero point corrections.
*     FJACC( LJC, * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        Array of residuals and derivates.
*        The first part of this array gives the partial derivative of
*        each residual with respect to each correction, evaluated with
*        the current set of correctins. The final part contains the the
*        weighted differences between the logarithmic scale factor
*        difference expected between a pair of data arrays on the basis
*        of the current corrections and the differences that were
*        actually observed and the equivalent values for the zero point
*        differences. The final 2 residuals, if used, are the weighted
*        mean logarithmic scale factor and zero point corrections (or
*        those for the "reference data array", if given); these serve
*        simply to constrain these corrections to be zero.
*     LJC = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension size of the FJACC array.
*     IGO = INTEGER (Given)
*        Unused.
*     IOPT( * ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Unused.
*     ROPT( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Unused.

*  Notes:
*     This routine reads data from global variables held in common.

*  History:
*     30-APR-1992 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     4-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Added ability to constrain the corrections applied to the
*        "reference data array".
*     14-AUG-1992 (RFWS):
*        Installed scaling factors for the variables being optimised
*        and converted the zero point corrections to refer to the mean
*        false origin values stored in global variables.
*     19-SEP-1996 (PDRAPER):
*        Converted to be used from PDA routine PDA_DQED, rather than
*        the NAG routine E04GBF.
