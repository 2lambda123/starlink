      SUBROUTINE CCD1_NMID( ID, JNDF, NCARD, IPFITS, SINDEX, MATCH,
     :                      STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCD1_NMID

*  Purpose:
*     Check if stored frameset matches NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCD1_NMID( ID, JNDF, NCARD, IPFITS, SINDEX, MATCH, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine checks the characteristics of a given NDF to see
*     whether it matches the ID string.  The ID string is
*     (of the same type as) that written by
*     the ASTEXP task to the AST file identifying framesets, so that
*     matching is in the sense defined by that task.  The ID string
*     consists of a keyword indicating the kind of test, followed by
*     some text in a format specific to that keyword.  Currently
*     implemented keywords are:
*
*        FITSID <fitskey> <value>
*           An NDF matches this ID if the first FITS header card with
*           the keyword <fitskey> has the value <value>.  If the value
*           is of type CHARACTER it must be in single quotes.  <fitskey>
*           may be compound to permit reading of hierarchical keywords.
*        INDEX <number>
*           An NDF matches this ID if the JNDF argument is equal to
*           <number>.
*        SET <number>
*           An NDF matches this ID if its Set Index attribute is equal
*           to <number>

*  Arguments:
*     ID = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        String identifying the NDF.
*     JNDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        Index of NDF in set being considered.  This is used if the ID
*        is of type INDEX.
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of FITS header cards pointed to by IPFITS.  This is
*        used if the ID is of type FITS.
*     IPFITS = INTEGER (Given)
*        A pointer to an array of mapped FITS header cards.  This is
*        used if the ID is of type FITS.
*     SINDEX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The Set Index attribute of the NDF.  This is used if the ID is
*        of type SET.
*     MATCH = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether the NDF matches the given ID string.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
