*  Name:
*     IRH_COM

*  Purpose:
*     Define IRH_ common block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global variables include file.

*  Description:
*     This file defines global variables which describe the state of
*     IRH, and properties of each group known to IRH. Information
*     describing each group is stored in arrays in common. The same
*     element from different arrays holds information for the same
*     group. Different elements within each array hold information for
*     different groups.  The identifiers used by IRH to identify each
*     group are just the index into these common arrays at which the
*     information describing the group is stored. The arrays have a
*     lower bound of 1 and an upper bound given by symbolic constant
*     IRH__MAXG.
*
*     Note, the names which actually form the group are not stored in
*     common, but are stored in a temporary HDS structure (see routine
*     IRH1_GTIDH).

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The SAE_PAR and IRH_PAR include files should be included before
*     this file, in order to define constants used here.

*  Global Variables:

*  Group size.
*  ==========
*  The number of names stored in each group. This is generally smaller
*  than the size of the arrays used to hold the group contents.
      INTEGER HCM_GSIZE( IRH__MAXG )

*  GROUP array locator.
*  ===================
*  The locator to the array of group structures. Each GROUP structure is
*  one cell of this array.
      CHARACTER HCM_LOC*( DAT__SZLOC )

*  GROUP structure locators.
*  ========================
*  This array holds the HDS locators to the GROUP structures holding
*  information about the names which form each group.
      CHARACTER HCM_LOCG( IRH__MAXG )*( DAT__SZLOC )

*  Locators to GROUP components holding group contents.
*  ===================================================
*  Each GROUP structure has 5 primative array components, called
*  NAMES, MOD_GROUP, MOD_INDEX, LEVEL, and FILE. These define the actual
*  contents of the group and have indentical sizes (given by HCM_SIZE).
      CHARACTER HCM_LOCNM( IRH__MAXG )*( DAT__SZLOC )
      CHARACTER HCM_LOCMG( IRH__MAXG )*( DAT__SZLOC )
      CHARACTER HCM_LOCMI( IRH__MAXG )*( DAT__SZLOC )
      CHARACTER HCM_LOCLV( IRH__MAXG )*( DAT__SZLOC )
      CHARACTER HCM_LOCFL( IRH__MAXG )*( DAT__SZLOC )

*  Pointers to mapped arrays holding group contents.
*  ===============================================
*  The 5 array components of each GROUP structure are kept permanently
*  mapped (until the group is annulled).
      INTEGER HCM_NMPNT( IRH__MAXG )
      INTEGER HCM_MGPNT( IRH__MAXG )
      INTEGER HCM_MIPNT( IRH__MAXG )
      INTEGER HCM_LVPNT( IRH__MAXG )
      INTEGER HCM_FLPNT( IRH__MAXG )

*  Size of the arrays used to hold the group contents.
*  ==================================================
*  This array holds the upper bound of the array components of each
*  GROUP structure (the lower bound is always 1). It is updated when
*  the arrays are extended to make room for more names.
      INTEGER HCM_SIZE( IRH__MAXG )

*  State of the IRH system.
*  =======================
*  This character scalar is used to indicate that IRH has been
*  initialised. On initialisation, it is set to the value of the
*  symbolic constant IRH__GOING. When IRH is closed it is set to a
*  blank value.
      CHARACTER HCM_STATE*( IRH__SZSTAT )

*  Which slots have been used.
*  ==========================
*  Each element of this array is .TRUE. if the corresponding element of 
*  the other arrays holds information describing a currently defined
*  group. Further information described the group (including the names
*  which form the group) is stored in a temporary HDS structure of type
*  GROUP.
      LOGICAL HCM_VALID( IRH__MAXG )




*  Declare the common block /IRH_COM1/, to hold word-aligned variables.
      COMMON /IRH_COM1/ HCM_GSIZE, HCM_NMPNT, HCM_MGPNT, HCM_MIPNT,
     :                  HCM_LVPNT, HCM_FLPNT, HCM_SIZE, HCM_VALID

*  Declare the common block /IRH_COM2/, to hold character variables.
      COMMON /IRH_COM2/ HCM_LOC, HCM_LOCG, HCM_LOCNM, HCM_LOCMG,
     :                  HCM_LOCMI, HCM_LOCLV, HCM_LOCFL, HCM_STATE
