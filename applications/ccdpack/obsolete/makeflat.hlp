Produces a flatfield calibration image.

Usage:

   makeflat in out method { alpha=?
                          { sigmas=?
                          { sigmas=? niter=?
                          { min=? max=?

Description:

   This routine combines a set of frames into a flatfield. The
   input data should be of a photometrically flat source, and
   should be corrected for any instrumental effects. The output
   calibration frame is normalised to have an average value of one.

   The input data are filtered in an attempt to remove any small
   blemishes etc. before combination.  This is achieved by smoothing
   using a boxfilter and then comparing with the original data. An
   estimate of the standard deviation of each pixel from its
   surroundings is made. Pixels deviating by more than GAMMA
   standard deviations are rejected. This procedure is then
   iterated ITER times. In this way, all image features with a
   scale size comparable with, or smaller than, the smoothing area
   size are rejected.

Parameters

For information on individual parameters, select from the list below:

ALPHA

ALPHA = _REAL (Read)
   The fraction of extreme values to remove before combining
   the data at any pixel. This fraction is removed from each
   extreme so can only take a value in the range 0 to 0.5.
   Only used if METHOD="TRIMMED"
   [0.2]

BOXSIZE

BOXSIZE(2) = _INTEGER (Read)
   The X and Y sizes (in pixels) of the rectangular box to be
   applied to smooth the input images. If only a single value is
   given, then it will be duplicated so that a square filter is
   used. The values given will be rounded up to positive odd
   integers if necessary. The values should be adjusted to be
   larger than the size of any expected defects.
   [15,15]

CLEAN

CLEAN = _LOGICAL (Read)
   Whether or not to attempt to clean the input images of any
   defects. For some data types (i.e. spectra) small scale
   strutures and sharp edges may be real and can be protected
   against removal by setting this parameter FALSE.
   [TRUE]

GENVAR

GENVAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE and USEVAR is also FALSE, then "variances" for the
   output image will be generated using the natural variation in
   the input images. These values can be used to estimate the
   quality of the output flatfield.

   Note that for this option to work well you should have many
   images and that any output pixels that only have one input
   image contributing to their value will have their variances
   set bad.
   [FALSE]

GAMMA

GAMMA = _REAL (Read)
   The number of standard deviations by which a value has to
   deviate from the local mean (defined by the mean within a box
   of BOXSIZE(1) by BOXSIZE(2) pixels) before it is considered to
   be in error. Aberrant pixels are removed from the data before
   the next "cleaning" iteration is performed.
   [3.0]

IN

IN = LITERAL (Read)
   A list image names. These contain the flatfield data.  The image
   names should be separated by commas and may include wildcards.

ITER

ITER = _INTEGER (Read)
   The number of defect rejecting iterations.
   [3]

KEEPIN

KEEPIN = _LOGICAL (Read)
   Whether to keep (i.e. not delete) the input images or
   not. Deleting the input images has the advantage of saving disk
   space, but should probably only be used if this program is part
   of a sequence of commands and the intermediary data used by
   it are not important.

   The default for this parameter is TRUE and this cannot be
   overridden except by assignment on the command line or in
   response to a forced prompt.
   [TRUE]

LOGFILE

LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
   Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
   this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
   the value of the LOGTO parameter.

   If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
   then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
   default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
   [CCDPACK.LOG]

LOGTO

LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
   Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
   for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
   This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
   unique abbreviation of the following:

      -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only

      -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
                      LOGFILE parameter)

      -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
                      logfile

      -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all

   If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
   then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
   default is "BOTH".
   [BOTH]

MAX

MAX = _REAL (Read)
   If METHOD = "THRESH" then this value defines the upper limit
   for values which can be used when combining the data. This
   limit applies to the output data range.

METHOD

METHOD = LITERAL (Read)
   The method to be used to combine the data components of
   the input images. This may be set to any unique abbreviation of
   the following:

      -  MEAN      -- Mean of the input data values

      -  MEDIAN    -- Weighted median of the input data values

      -  TRIMMED   -- An "alpha trimmed mean" in which a fraction
                      alpha of the values are removed from
                      each extreme

      -  MODE      -- An iteratively "sigma clipped" mean which
                      approximates to the modal value

      -  SIGMA     -- A sigma clipped mean

      -  THRESHOLD -- Mean with values above and below given
                      limits removed

      -  MINMAX    -- Mean with the highest and lowest values
                      removed

      -  BROADENED -- A broadened median (the mean of a small
                      number of central values)

      -  CLIPMED   -- A sigma clipped median (like SIGMA except
                      that the median of the clipped values is used)

      -  FASTMED    -- Unweighted median of the input data values
   [MEDIAN]

MIN

MIN = _REAL (Read)
   If METHOD = "THRESH" then this value defines the lower limit
   for values which can be used when combining the data. This
   limit applies to the output data range.

MINPIX

MINPIX = _INTEGER (Read)
   The minimum number of good (ie. not BAD) pixels required which
   are required to contribute to the value of an output pixel.
   Output pixels not meeting this requirement are set BAD.
   [1]

NITER

NITER = _INTEGER (Read)
   The number of refining iterations performed if METHOD = "MODE".
   [7]

OUT

OUT = LITERAL (Write)
   Name of an image to contain the output flatfield data. Note this
   image will have a precision of at least _REAL.
   If USESET is true and multiple Sets are represented in the IN
   list then this name will be used as the name of an HDS 
   container file containing one NDF structure for each Set Index value.
   This name may be specified using indirection through a file.
   [TRUE]

SIGMAS

SIGMAS = _REAL (Read)
   Number of standard deviations to reject data at. Used for
   "MODE", "SIGMA" and "CLIPMED" methods. For METHOD = "MODE" the
   standard deviation is estimated from the population of values, for
   METHOD = "SIGMA" and "CLIPMED" the variances are used. If no
   variances exist then one is estimated from the population of
   values.
   [4.0]

USESET

USESET = _LOGICAL (Read)
   Whether to use Set header information or not.  If USESET is
   false then any Set header information will be ignored.
   If USESET is true, then input files will be considered in
   groups; a separate flatfield will be constructed for each
   group of corresponding input frames (i.e. those sharing 
   the same Set Index attribute).  If this results in multiple
   output flatfields, they will be written as separate NDF structures 
   into a single HDS container file.  If no Set header information 
   is present in the input files, then flatfielding is done 
   on all the input files together, so USESET can usually be 
   safely set to TRUE (the default).

   If a global value for this parameter has been set using 
   CCDSETUP then that value will be used.
   [TRUE]

USEVAR

USEVAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
   If TRUE and all the input images contain error information
   (variances), then these will be used as weights during image
   combination and will be propagated to the output image.
   [TRUE]

TITLE

TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
   Title for the output image.
   [Output from MAKEFLAT]

Examples

makeflat in='"f1,f2,f3,f4,f5"' method=median out=mflat
   This forms a master flat field from images f1 to f5. The input
   data are first cleaned using the default values for the GAMMA
   and ITER parameters. The combination mode chosen is the
   median.  The output image is mflat. Note the quotes when
   entering a comma separated list on the command line.

makeflat in=^flat_frames.lis out=master_flat
   In this example the list of images is read from the file
   flat_frames.lis. This file may contain indirection to other files
   up to a depth of 7.

makeflat in='flatr/*' out='flatr/master_flat' gamma=2.5 iter=5
   In this example all the images in the subdirectory bias/ are
   used. The input data are severely cleaned using a noise cut
   of 2.5 standard deviations (current) and 5 iterations. Such
   severe cleaning is only recommended when many input frames
   are given, if this is not the case then BAD areas may be seen
   in the output image.
makeflat in='ff*' out=master_flat gamma=10 iter=1
   In this example all the frames "ff*" are combined into a master
   flatfield. Defect rejection is still performed but with
   gamma set so high and by performing only one iteration
   almost no bad data will be detected.


Notes

- The data input into this routine should have bias strip
  regions and any badly vignetted parts removed.
- The input images are normalised to have a mean of one
  before being combined. This makes sure that all input images
  contribute to the final result (even though, for instance,
  they were taken on a source of varying brightness, e.g. the
  twilight sky).


Behaviour_of_parameters

   Most parameters retain their current value as default. The
   "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
   application. If the application has not been run then the
   "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
   The exceptions to this rule are:

      - TITLE   -- always "Output from MAKEFLAT"

      - KEEPIN  -- always TRUE

   Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
   define the default behaviour of the application but does mean
   that additional care needs to be taken when using the application
   on new datasets/different devices, or after a break of sometime.
   The intrinsic default behaviour of the application may be
   restored by using the RESET keyword on the command line.

   Certain parameters (LOGTO, LOGFILE and USESET) have global values. These
   global values will always take precedence, except when an
   assignment is made on the command line.  Global values may be set
   and reset using the CCDSETUP and CCDCLEAR commands.

Implementation_Status

   - The routine supports BAD pixels and all data types except
     COMPLEX.  All combinational arithmetic is performed using
     floating point.  The AXIS and TITLE components are correctly
     propagated. The output is a ratio so the units are set to blank.
     The variances are propagated through the combination
     processing, assuming that the input data have a normal
     distribution.
