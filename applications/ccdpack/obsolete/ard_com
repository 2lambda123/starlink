*  Name:
*     ARD_COM

*  Purpose:
*     Define ARD_ keyword common block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global variables include file.

*  Description:
*     This file defines global variables in which the ARD system can
*     store the current list of region keywords, together with their
*     properties - this information forms a description table. The
*     properties define how many trailing coordinates are expected with
*     each keyword, which dimensions are valid, how many extra values
*     are required after the coordinate specifiers, whether to check
*     the coordinates for dimension compliance and the allowed
*     coordinate types.

*  Prior requirements:
*     The file ARD_PAR should be included before this file.

*  Notes:
*     These values should be initialised by the ARD_INIT routine.

*  Global Variables:

      CHARACTER * ( ARD__KEYLEN ) ARD_KWORDS( ARD__MAXKEY )
*  The list of available keywords.

      INTEGER ARD_PERDIM( ARD__MAXKEY )
*  The number of coordinates expected per dimension.  (I.e. if require
*  X,Y then PERDIM is 1, if expect X1,Y1,X2,Y2 then PERDIM is 2). If
*  set to -1 then no limit is set (-1) then no limit should be applied
*  other than an integer of the current dimensionality.

      LOGICAL ARD_VALDIM( ARD__MAXDIM, ARD__MAXKEY )
*  The dimensionalities which are valid for this keyword.
*  If PERDIM is -1 and COMPLY is set false then this value should be
*  set true for the dimensions which the values actually apply in.

      INTEGER ARD_EXTRA( ARD__MAXKEY )
*  The number of extra values which trail a valid sequence of
*  coordinates.

      LOGICAL ARD_COMPLY( ARD__MAXKEY )
*  Whether to check the coordinate list for compliance with the current
*  dimensionality. This should simply be performed by finding out
*  whether the coordinates are a multiple of the dimensionality. Regions
*  with explicit requirements (ie. PERDIM not equal to -1 ) should set
*  this value to false, as checking is performed explicitly for the
*  required number of returns.

      CHARACTER * ( 1 ) ARD_TYPE( ARD__MAXKEY )
*  The coordinate type which a region requires. May be one one 'C', 'P'
*  or 'A'. 'C' means that only none pixel index coordinates are
*  supported, this is indicated by a floating type for all coordinates.
*  'P' means that the values should be pixel indices and only pixel
*  indices. 'A' stands for any if which case the coordinates will not be
*  checked for type.

*  Define common block for character alignments.
      COMMON / ARD_COM1 /
     : ARD_KWORDS,
     : ARD_TYPE

*  Define common block for word-aligned variables.
      COMMON / ARD_COM2 /
     : ARD_PERDIM,
     : ARD_VALDIM,
     : ARD_EXTRA,
     : ARD_COMPLY
