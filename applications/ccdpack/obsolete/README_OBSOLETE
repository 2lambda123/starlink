This directory holds obsolete files from CCDPACK.

It has all the files from the original RCS repository for CCDPACK which
never made it into the autoconfed version.  Some of these files 
were used in the last non-autoconfed release (many of them related
to IRAF compatibility) and some of them have been absent from the
built version for many years.  All are left here in case they may
be of historical use or value at some time in the future.
