This directory holds obsolete files from CCDPACK.

It has all the files from the original RCS repository for CCDPACK which
never made it into the autoconfed version.  Some of these files 
were used in the last non-autoconfed release (many of them related
to IRAF compatibility) and some of them have been absent from the
built version for many years.  All are left here in case they may
be of historical use or value at some time in the future.

Most of the files have now been cvs remove'd into the Attic. To
recover these you'll need to inspect the cvs log output and retrieve
a specific version (or use the cvsweb interface to show the Attic
contents).
