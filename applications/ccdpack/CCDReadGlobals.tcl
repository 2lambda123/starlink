#+
#  Name:
#     CCDReadGlobals

#  Purpose:
#     Reads and restores a setup file.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     First a prompt is made for the name of a file from which to read
#     a saved setup. This defaults to $HOME/.ccdpack. Then this file is
#     sourced restoring the state. (State files are written out by the
#     CCDSaveGlobals procedure and consist of Tcl commands to restore
#     the names and values of all the CCDxxxxx global parameters).

#  Arguments:
#     topwin = window (read)
#        The name of the top-level window in which to make a prompt for
#        a filename.
