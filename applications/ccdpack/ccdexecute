#  Name:
#      ccdexecute

#  Purpose:
#      Executes a CCDPACK command file in the background.

#  Language:
#      C shell

#  Type of Module:
#      C shell script

#  Description:
#      This command saves the current ADAM execution environment
#      and then executes the given command procedure in the
#      background. The output from executing the procedure is
#      written to the file "logfile". The type of script file
#      should be "CSH" or "ICL". "CSH" for a C-shell script and
#      "ICL" for an ICL script.

#  Usage:
#      ccdexecute script_type user_script [logfile]

#  ADAM Parameters:
#      $1 = string (read)
#         The type of command file to be executed, "CSH" or "ICL".
#      $2 = filename (read)
#         The name of the script file which contains the
#         CCDPACK commands which are to be run in the background.
#      $3 = filename (write)
#         The name of a file to contain any output from the execution
#         of the command procedure.

#  Examples:
#      ccdexecute ccdred ccdred.log
#         In this example the CCDPACK commands written in the file
#         ccdred are executed and any output is recorded in the
#         file ccdred.log.

#  Note:
#      - C shell specific.

#  History:
#      4-JAN-1994 (PDRAPER):
#         Original Version.
#      18-AUG-1995 (PDRAPER):
#         Added code to unset ICL_TASK_NAME as this was causing tasks
#         to try to communicate with ICL when run from the Tcl GUI! Also
#         unset ADAM_TASK_TYPE which might make future TCL tasks not
#         reset the parameter system (probably not important for C-shell).
#      17-JUL-2008 (TIMJ):
#         Use $STARLINK_DIR for relocation, not $STARLINK
#      {enter_changes_here}
