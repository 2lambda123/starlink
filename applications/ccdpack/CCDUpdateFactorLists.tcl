#  Name:
#     CCDUpdateFactorLists

#  Purpose:
#     Updates the exposure factors for flash and dark frames.

#  Language:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure

#  Description:
#     This routine records the exposure times of dark and flash frames
#     in the appropriate elements of the global array CCDndfs. The times
#     used are assumed to be stored (together with the file names) in
#     a Table widget (or multitem). The number of columns determines
#     the actions (a single time is assumed to be that associated 
#     with the given frame type).
#
#     If the data are flash frames then it is assumed that they have a
#     flash exposure time (which is 1 if CCDsame(flashes) is true) and
#     a dark time (which defaults to 0 if unless set).
#
#     If the data are dark frames then it is assumed that they have a 
#     dark exposure time (which is 1 if CCDsame(darks) is true) and
#     have a flash time of 0.

#  Arguments:
#     element = string (read)
#        The name of the element of the global array CCDndfs which will
#         contain the (Tcl) list of NDF names returned from the user.
#     Table = window (read)
#        The name of the Table (which may be a multitem) which
#        contains the information to be updated in the global arrays.

#  Global Variables:
#      CCDndfs = array (write)
#         An array of lists of NDF names. The NDFs selected by this
#          procedure are written to element CCDndfs($element).
#      CCDfactors = array (write)
#         If required this array will contain lists of exposure
#         factors for dark counts or pre-flash. The indices are
#         ($element,darks) and ($element,flashes) if used.
#      CCDsame = array (read)
#         This array's elements are (darks) and (flashes) if these are
#         false then values for the dark and/or pre-flash time are
#         assumed to be present.
