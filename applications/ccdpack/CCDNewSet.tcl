   proc CCDNewSet { Unsetbox Setbox items } {
#+
#  Name:
#     CCDNewSet

#  Purpose:
#     Marks NDFs for Set header addition.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure

#  Description:
#     This routine gets a list of NDFs and marks them for Set header
#     addition.  It basically does the following:
#        - enters them into the setted listbox as a complete Set
#        - marks the names in the unsetted listbox with their Set indices

#  Arguments:
#     Unsetbox = string
#        The name of the listbox containing all the available NDFs.
#     Setbox = string
#        The name of the listbox which will contain Sets of NDFs. 
#     items = list of integers
#        A list of integers (indexes) identifying items from the list in
#        Unsetbox which will consitute a new Set in the Setbox.

#  Global Variables:
#     CCDsetindices = list of integers
#        The NDF Set Index values that we know about.
