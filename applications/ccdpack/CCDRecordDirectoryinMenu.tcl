#  Name:
#     CCDRecordDirectoryinMenu

#  Purpose:
#     Creates a command in a menu to return to the current directory.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     This procedure creates a command in a menu (which is part of a
#     menubar) which will return to the current directory when invoked.
#     The procedure assumes that a labelled entry widget exists which
#     needs the current directory written into it and that a button of
#     a choice bar exists which when invoked will change the directory
#     to the menu name. Directories which have been visited previously
#     are not re-entered.

#  Arguments:
#     menubar = window (read)
#        The name of (CCDPACK) menubar which is to have the command
#        added to one of its menus.
#     menu = string (read)
#        The name of the menubar menu which is to have the command
#        added.
#     directory = string (read)
#        The name of the directory which is to be entered.
#     entry = window (read)
#        The name of a labelled entry widget to recieve the name of the
#        directory when the menu command is invoked.
#     choicebar = window (read)
#        The name of the choice bar which contains the button as a named
#        option.
#     button = window (read)
#        The name of a button in a choice bar which when invoked
#        will perform the actual change of directory.

#  Global Variables:
#     CCDmenudirs$menu() = array (write)
#        The list of directories associated with the menu. This is
#        indexed by the directory name.
