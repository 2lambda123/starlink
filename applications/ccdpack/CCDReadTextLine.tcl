   proc CCDReadTextLine { fileid } {

#+
#  Name:
#     CCDReadTextLine.tcl

#  Purpose:
#     Reads a line of information from a text file.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tk/Tcl

#  Description:
#     This procedure reads in a line of information from a file which has
#     its contents in the usual CCDPACK text file format. This allows for
#     comments (indicated by the characters "!" and "#") continuation
#     lines (indicated by a "-" at the end of the line) and blank lines.
#     Comments are skipped or removed, continued lines are joined and
#     blank lines are skipped. The return is an extracted line of
#     information ready for processing. This is in the original case.

#  Arguments:
#     fileid = string (read)
#        The Tcl file descriptor (returned from an open command)

#  Returned Value:
#     CCDReadTextLine = string
#        The extracted (joined, comment stripped etc.) line
#        read from the file. If an error occurs (such as no more lines
#        to read etc.) then a null value is returned.
