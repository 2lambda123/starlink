*  Name:
*     CCD1_FDCM

*  Purpose:
*     Defines the common block for communicating file descriptors.

*  Invocation:
*     INCLUDE 'CCD1_FDCM'

*  Description:
*     This houses the common block for communicating file descriptors 
*     to the source and sink routines required when using AST Channels.
*     The global variables defined are intended for use as FIO-type
*     file descriptors, but the values are integers so could equally
*     be FORTRAN unit numbers or have some other suitable meaning.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
