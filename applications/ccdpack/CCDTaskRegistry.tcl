proc CCDTaskRegistry { } {

#+
#  Name:
#     CCDTaskRegistry

#  Purpose:
#     Sets up the monolith-application name associations used by CCDPACK.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     This routine sets up the application commands that can be used
#     by this interface. All applications used should be registered
#     here before any ADAM tasks are started. After using this routine
#     applications can be run using the appropriate precedures (such as
#     CCDRunTask) by just using the application name.
#
#     The registry process assumes no knowledge about the monolith
#     that the application runs from, it locates the monolith by
#     tracking the softlink.

#  Global Variables:
#     MONOLITH = array (write)
#        This variable describes the monoliths that the commands are
#        part of, the name of their executable, their status and the
#        command name associated with them. The elements have indices,
#
#           (name,location)        ! where the monolith executable is
#           (name,status)          ! One of enabled,available,unavailable
#           (name,taskname)        ! taskname should be unique, not set here
#
#        This also has an additional element (index) that should be
#        incremented to give unique tasknames to the monoliths (if
#        they are killed timing problems mean that using the same name
#        may fail)
#     TASK = array (write)
#        This variable holds the names of the available applications
#        and their associated monoliths. It also holds (after the
#        application has run) the output an error message and a a
#        return status. The elements have indices,
#
#           (name,monolith)        ! monolith associated with this command
#           (name,return)          ! only set when application completes
#           (name,error)           ! error message is fails
#           (name,output)          ! full output messages
#
#        Only the (name,monolith) element is set by this routine.
#     CCDdir = string (read)
#        The CCDPACK installation directory.
#     KAPdir = string (read)
#        The KAPPA installation directory.

#  Return Value:
#     CCDTaskRegistry = boolean
#        Returns 1 if ok, 0 otherwise (failed to locate CCDPACK monolith).

#  History:
#     11-OCT-1994 (PDRAPER):
#        Original version.
#     31-OCT-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Recoded to check monoliths by back tracking the link from the
#        command name to the executable.
#     19-JUN-2001 (MBT):
#        Added some tasks: ccdedit, makeset, showset.
