   itcl_class Ccd_gwm {

#+
#  Name:
#     Ccd_gwm

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Defines a scrollable, resizable gwm based widget.

#  Description:
#     This routine defines a widget class based around the gwm canvas
#     widget. It creates a canvas with scrollbars that may be
#     displayed into by graphics applications. If a graphics context
#     command is registered then it can be called to restore any
#     graphics if the canvas is resized, either interactively (via the
#     reconfiguration event) or if the configuration cantrolling the
#     canvas size are changed.

#  Invocations:
#
#        Ccd_gwm window [-option value]...
#
#     This command create an instance of a "scrollable gwm widget" and
#     returns a command "window" for manipulating it via the methods and
#     configuration options described below. Configuration options may
#     be appended to the command.
#
#        window configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the widget
#     instance has been created).
#
#        window method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this widget.

#  Configuration options:
#
#        -gwmname name
#
#     Defines the GWM widget name (as recognised by GNS). Defaults to 
#     xwindows.
#
#        -redraw boolean
#
#     Whether or not to resize the Gwm widget when the canvas size changes.
#
#        -drawcommand command
#
#      A command to invoke when the widget is resized. This should restore
#      the graphic context (i.e. re-draw the image to the new size and 
#      redraw any graphics).
#
#        -scrollregion bounds
#
#      Defines the bounds of the scrollable part of the widget. This is
#      the size of the canvas.
#
#        -width width
#    
#      Define the viewable width of the canvas (the bit you see).
#
#        -height height
#    
#      Define the viewable height of the canvas.
#
#        -tags tag
#
#      The canvas tag for the Gwm widget, defaults to Gwm.
#
#         -scrollbarplaces (right|left) (top|bottom)
#
#      Where to put the scrollbars.
#
#         -colours number
#
#      Number of colours to attempt for the Gwm widget. Defaults to 64.
#
#         -mincolours number
#
#      Minimum number of colours that are required. KAPPA lutcol 
#      requires 34 so this is the default value.
#      

#  Methods:
#     constructor [-option value]...
#        This method is invoked automatically by the class command and
#	 creates the "class " widget with a default configuration,
#	 except when overridden by command line options.
#     configure [-option value]...
#        Activates the configuration options. If no configuration value
#	 is given then the current value of any known option is returned
#	 in a form similar (but not identical to) the Tk widget command.
#     method do args
#        This method provides access to the canvas. The args are those
#        you would use in a command to control the canvas.
#     method zoom scale 
#        Increases the size of the Gwm widget by the factor scale. This 
#        causes the widget to be destroyed and re-created at the new size.
#        Consequently if will be blank unless a graphic context 
#        restoring procedure has been registered.
#     method sethelp docname label
#        Sets the help associated with the widget.
#     internal methods
#        _scrollregion, _reconfigure _autoscan and _cancelrepeat, should
#        not be used outside of the class definitions.
