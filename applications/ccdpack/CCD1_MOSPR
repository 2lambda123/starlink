*  Name:
*     CCD1_MOSPR

*  Purpose:
*     Define global constants specific to the MAKEMOS application.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global constants include file.

*  Description:
*     This file defines global constants which are used by more than
*     one routine in the MAKEMOS application.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     This file should be preceded by the CCD1_PAR include file which
*     defines necessary constants.

*  Global Constants:

*  Maximum possible number of pair-wise inter-comparisons of the input
*  NDFs (note we allow for one extra "reference NDF" in addition to the
*  limit set by CCD1__MXNDF).
      INTEGER CCD1__MXCMP
      PARAMETER ( CCD1__MXCMP =
     :          ( ( CCD1__MXNDF + 1 ) * CCD1__MXNDF ) / 2 )

*  A "large" weighting factor; sufficient to swamp all other "normal"
*  weights but not so large as to cause numerical problems such as
*  overflow.
      DOUBLE PRECISION CCD1__BIGWT
      PARAMETER ( CCD1__BIGWT = 1.0D4 )
