#  Name:
#     XREDUCE

#  Purpose:
#     Starts the automated CCD data reduction GUI.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Usage:
#     xreduce

#  Description:
#     This command starts the CCDPACK reduction GUI.
#
#     The GUI is specifically designed to help the inexperienced or
#     occasional reducer of CCD data (although others will also find
#     it of use). These aims are meet by providing an easy to use, X
#     based, graphical interface that features contextual help and
#     that limits options to those of immediate relevance. It
#     concentrates on data organization and the definition of any CCD
#     characteristics rather than on the nature and control of the
#     core CCDPACK reduction programs.
#
#     The reduction of the actual data is separate to the GUI and uses
#     the automated scheduling facilities of CCDPACK.

#  Notes:
#     Unknown detectors.
#        If you do develop an import table or restoration (setup) file
#        for a telescope/detector pass these on to the maintainer of
#        this package, together with a description. They will be
#        distributed in future releases for the benefit of others.

#  Configuration:
#     The interface can be configured by controlling the values of
#     various CCDxxxxx global variables. These can be set in either a
#     global configuration file called ".ccdpack" which should be
#     placed in the $HOME directory, or by loading as part of a state
#     from a local ".ccdpack" file. The names and functions of the
#     more significant configurations follows.
#
#        - CCDbrowser, the name of the WWW browser used to show
#          hypertext help. This may only be Mosaic or netscape (or
#          whatever the names of these browsers are on your system)
#          and should be the full path names if they are not located
#          on your PATH.
#
#          This option can also be set using the environment variable
#          HTX_BROWSER.
#
#          The default is [Mm]osiac followed by [Nn]etscape.
#
#        - CCDstarhtml, the top directories that contains the
#          Starlink HTML documents (in particular sun139 and ccdpack
#          hypertext help). This defaults to 
#          $CCDPACK_DIR/../../docs:$CCDPACK_DIR/../../help.
#
#        - CCDprefs, this is an array of values that define widget
#          preferences such as the colour scheme and the reliefs etc.
#          The more interesting elements are:
#             - (priority), this defines the priority of the preferences.
#               If you want to override colours and fonts etc. from
#               your .Xdefaults then set this value to widgetDefault.
#               The normal value is userDefault as I think it looks nice
#               the way it is.
#             - (font_size), this is set to 12 or 14. Normally this is
#               set to 14 if your display has more than 800 pixels in
#               both dimensions.
#             - (scheme_colour), this controls the scheme of colours
#               used by the interface. XREDUCE has its own scheme but
#               you override this by setting this to a new colour for
#               the background, the other colours will be derived from
#               this. For finer control see the palette.tcl script in
#               the Tcl distribution.
#             - (click_for_focus), this controls how the focus moves
#               between the various widgets. If you set this to 0
#               (false), then the focus follows the cursor position.
#
#        - CCDdetectorcache, the directory that contains the known
#          detector setups and import tables. Defaults to CCDPACK_DIR.
#          If the variable CCDPACKC_CONFIG is set this directory is also
#          used.
#
#     An example configuration file follows.
#
#        file: ~/.ccdpack
#
#        set CCDbrowser netscape
#        set CCDprefs(priority) widgetDefault
#        set CCDprefs(scheme_colour) bisque
#        set CCDprefs(click_for_focus) 1
#        set CCDdetectorcache /home/user/ccdsetups
#
#     This sets the default browser to netscape, allows your .Xdefaults
#     to override any internal preferences, makes the focus follow the
#     mouse and defines a local directory that contains setups and
#     import tables.
