#  Name:
#     CCDRestoreFromImportFile

#  Purpose:
#     Reads the contents of an import table entering the contents into
#     two tables widgets.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure

#  Description:
#     This routine reads in a standard CCDPACK import control table.
#     Any occurrences of FITS item declarations are located and entered
#     into the fitstable window (which should be a table widget of
#     size 2). Occurrences of CCDPACK extension items are entered into
#     the extentable window (which should also be a table of size 2)

#  Parameters:
#     importtable = filename (read)
#        The name of an existing import control table.
#     fitstable = window (read)
#        A table widget to contain the FITS item declarations (will be
#        emptied first).
#     extentable = window (read)
#        A table widget to contain the extension item expression (will be
#        emptied first).
