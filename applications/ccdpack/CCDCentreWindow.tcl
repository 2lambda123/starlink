   proc CCDCentreWindow { Window {Master ""} } {
#+
#  Name:
#     CCDCentreWindow

#  Purpose:
#     Centres a window on the screen or another window.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     This routine takes a window and moves it so that it is centred
#     either over a given 'master' window (though it does not need to
#     be its master in other senses) or on the whole screen.  It also
#     tries to register it as a transient window working on behalf of
#     its master, which the window manager will hopefully take as a
#     hint to keep it on top.  The routine calls update idletasks since
#     it uses winfo reqwidth, which may not be correct yet otherwise.

#  Arguments:
#     Window = string
#        Command name or path name of a window to centre.
#     Master = string
#        If supplied, this gives the command name or path name of a
#        window over which Window is to be centred.  If absent
#        (or the empty string) then Window will be positioned in the
#        centre of the screen.
