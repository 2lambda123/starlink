   proc taskrun {app arguments {message ""} {window ""}} {
#+
#  Name:
#     taskrun

#  Purpose:
#     Runs an application.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     This routine runs an application of an ADAM task loaded using
#     the adamtask Tcl extensions. It will optionally display a message
#     while the task is running.  It will not return until the
#     application has completed.

#  Arguments:
#     app = string (read)
#        The name of the application to be run. This should be registered
#        in the routine CCDAppRegister.
#     arguments = string (read)
#        The arguments to be used with the application (as would be
#        supplied on the command line).
#     message = string (read)
#        If supplied as a non-empty string, this text will be displayed in
#        a window while the application executes.  In this case, no user
#        interaction will be allowed while the application is executing.
#     window = string (read)
#        If supplied as a non-empty string, and the message argument is
#        also present, this gives the pathname of a window over which
#        the message will be centred.

#  Global variables (of note):
#     CCDdir = string (read)
#        The CCDPACK binary directory.
#     TASK = array (read and write)
#        The element.
#
#          TASK($app,return)
#
#        Is only written to when the application exits, so can be used
#        to wait, but care needs to be taken with the timing since an
#        application may well complete quickly (i.e. before you get a
#        chance to tkwait). It is better to use the internal wait
#        method of this routine.
#
#        The elements.
#
#           TASK($app,error)
#           TASK($app,output)
#
#        may contain the actual textual output from the application
#        and any error messages.
#
#        The element
#
#           TASK($app,progress)
#
#        is used to indicate the fraction of the process that is completed.
