proc CCDTaskStart { app } {

#+
#  Name:
#     CCDTaskStart

#  Purpose:
#     Starts the monolith associated with an application.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     This routine checks if the monolith associated with an
#     application is running. If not it attempts to load it.

#  Arguments:
#     app = string (read)
#        Name of the application that will be run. The associated
#        monolith is loaded here.

#  Global Variables:
#     MONOLITH = array (read)
#        This variable describes the known monoliths, the name of
#        their executable, their status and the command name associated 
#        with them. The elements have indices,
#
#           (name,location)        ! where the monolith executable is
#           (name,status)          ! one of enabled,available,unavailable
#           (name,taskname)        ! taskname assigned here
#
#        This also has an additional element (index) that is
#        incremented to give unique tasknames to the monoliths (if
#        they are killed timing problems mean that using the same name 
#        may fail)
#     TASK = array (write)
#        This variable holds the names of the available applications
#        and their associated monoliths. It also holds (after the
#        application has run) the output an error message and a a
#        return status. The elements have indices,
#
#           (name,monolith)        ! monolith associated with this command
#           (name,return)          ! only set when application completes
#           (name,error)           ! error message is fails
#           (name,output)          ! full output messages
#
#        Only the (name,monolith) element is used by this routine.

#  Return Value:
#     CCDTaskStart = boolean 
#        Returns 1 if ok, 0 otherwise (failed to load monolith).
