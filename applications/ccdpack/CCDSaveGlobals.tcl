   proc CCDSaveGlobals { Top } {
#+
#  Name:
#     CCDSaveGlobals

#  Purpose:
#     Saves the current setup.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     This procedure saves the values of all the current CCDPACK related
#     global parameters into a file. This file may be read by the
#     corresponding application CCDReadGlobals which restores the
#     current state.
#
#     A prompt is made for the name of a file in which to save the
#     current setup. This defaults to .ccdpack in the current directory.

#  Arguments:
#     Top = window (read)
#        The name of the top-level window in which to make a prompt for
#        a filename.
