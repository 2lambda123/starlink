#  Name:
#     CCDCopyListbox

#  Purpose:
#     Copies a part of a listbox to another listbox.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     This routine copies either the current selection from one listbox
#     to another, or a given range of values. The mode of operation is
#     selected by the mode argument which must take a value of select or
#     range. If mode=select then any selection in the from listbox is
#     copied to the end of the current contents of the to listbox.
#     If mode=range then the args arguments specify the lower and upper
#     indices of the entries to copy.

#  Arguments:
#     from = window (read)
#        The listbox which is to have values copied
#     to = window (read)
#        The listbox which is to have values entered. New values are
#        appended to the end of any current contents (this could be
#        cleared first by a {$to delete 0 end} before calling this
#        routine).
#      mode = string (read)
#        The mode to use when determining the range of values to copy.
#        Either "select" if the current selection is to be copied, or
#        "range" if the args arguments have the lower and upper indices
#        of the range.
#      args = list (read)
#        Up to four values. The first two are used when mode=range,
#        when they specify the lower and upper indices of the values to
#        copy. The last two are strings to prepend and append to the
#        names which are copied. If mode!=range then only two values
#        will be used in which case they are the prepend and append
#        strings.
