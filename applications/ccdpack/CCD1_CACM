*  Name:
*     CCD1_CACM

*  Purpose:
*     Defines the common block for communicating character arrays.

*  Invocation:
*     INCLUDE 'CCD1_CACM'

*  Description:
*     This houses the common block for communicating the necessary 
*     information about a mapped character array to the source and 
*     sink routines required when using AST Channels.

*  Requirements:
*     DAT__SZLOC must be declared by including DAT_PAR before this 
*     file is included.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
