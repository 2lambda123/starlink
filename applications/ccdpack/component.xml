  <description>CCD data reduction package</description>
  <abstract>
    <p>CCDPACK is a package of programs for reducing CCD-like data. They
    allow you to debias, remove dark current, flatfield, register,
    resample and normalize data from single- or multiple-CCD instruments.
    </p>

    <p>CCDPACK is designed to help you to reduce your data easily.
    The basic reduction stages can be set up using an X based GUI that
    controls an automated reduction system.
    The GUI is designed to allow you to start working without any
    detailed knowledge of the package (or indeed of CCD reduction).
    Registration is performed using graphical, script based or automated
    techniques that help reduce the amount of work to a minimum.
    </p>

    <p>This document is intended for all users of CCDPACK.
    It provides instruction in how to use CCDPACK, describes CCD reduction
    in general and contains complete descriptions of the individual
    programs.
