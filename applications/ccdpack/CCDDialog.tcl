#        Original version.
#     23-AUG-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Added code to centre in parent top-level or screen.
#     13-MAY-1999 (PDRAPER):
#        Changed window control policy to just transient (explicit
#        raising causes problems with some WMs).

#        Upgraded for Tcl8.
#     3-JUL-2001 (MBT):
#        Extracted window centring to external routine CCDCentreWindow.
#     01-FEB-2006 (PDRAPER):
#        Changed to use new meta-widget names (s/Ccd_/Ccd::/g).
