#  Name:
#     mkindex.tcl

#  Purpose:
#     Make the tclIndex file.

#  Invocation:
#     ccdwish mkindex.tcl

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl script.

#  Description:
#     This is a script which can be sourced within the ccdwish shell to
#     generate the tclIndex file.  It just runs the standard Tcl
#     auto_mkindex proc on the relevant files in the current directory.
#     These files are pretty much all the files with .tcl, .itcl or .itk
#     extensions, with the exception of those which are themselves
#     designed to be sourced rather than simply defining procs.
# 
#     Note that it must be invoked within the directory for which the
#     tclIndex file is to be built.  It must also be invoked with a
#     valid setting of the DISPLAY environment variable (since otherwise
#     ccdwish cannot start up properly).
