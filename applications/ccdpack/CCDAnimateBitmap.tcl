   proc CCDAnimateBitmap { Window args } {
#+
#  Name:
#     CCDAnimateBitmap

#  Purpose:
#     Animate a bitmap holding widget.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     Control the animatation of a series of bitmaps in a given window. This
#     is achieved by changing the bitmap to one of those given in
#     a global array indexed by incrementing numbers, starting at 1.
#     The animatation may be stopped by calling this routine with a
#     single argument "stop".

#  Arguments:
#     Window = window (read)
#        Name of the window whose bitmap is to be animated, must be
#        configurable by the command "-bitmap".
#     args = list (read)
#        Either:
#          the name of a global array and its size (i.e. highest index).
#        Or:
#          "stop", to terminate the animation.
