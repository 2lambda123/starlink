itcl_class Ccd_multitem {
#+
#  Name:
#     Ccd_multitem

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Defines an class which controls a multiscrollbox, under the
#     assumption that the boxes contain related data fields.

#  Description:
#     This class implements control of a series of scrollboxes which
#     have related information entries. This means that they will have
#     the same number of entries, hence should be controlled singly in
#     the vertical direction. This is implemented by having a single
#     scrollbar if the scrollboxes are stack horizontally, or a series
#     of scrollbars (all controlled together) if stacked vertically).
#     The insertion, retrival and clearing mechanisms are setup to work
#     across the whole list of scrollboxes.

#  Invocations:
#
#        Ccd_multitem window [-option value]...
#
#     This command create an instance of a "multiscrollbox" and returns
#     a command "window" for manipulating it via the methods and
#     configuration options described below. Configuration options may
#     be appended to the command.
#
#        window configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the widget
#     instance has been created).
#
#        window method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this widget.

#  Configuration options:
#
#        -scrollbarplaces "place1 place2"
#
#     This option configures the placing of the scrollbars. These may
#     be any combination of orthogonal pairs of "left, right" and "top,
#     bottom" or any one or even none of these. The default is "right
#     bottom". The scrollbars are shown one to each listbox along the
#     horizontal directions and one only (at the left or right of the
#     multitem) for controlling the vertical scroll. The vertical scroll
#     of all listboxes are tied.
#
#        -exportselect boolean
#
#     This option configues the scrollboxes so that the selection is
#     the X11 selection or not. If a selection is to be made in more
#     than one scrollbox then this must be set to false (= 0).
#
#        -nboxes
#
#     The number of scrollboxes that are required in the multitem
#     widget. The default number is 2. This may be changed at any time,
#     but if it is changed then all the boxes are cleared (unlike for
#     multiscrollboxes)

#  Methods:
#     constructor [-option value]...
#        This method is invoked automatically by the class command and
#        creates the a multiitem widget with a default configuration,
#        except when overridden by command line options.
#     destructor
#        Destroys the multitem widget, invoked by the "delete" method.
#     configure [-option value]...
#        Activates the configuration options. If no configuration value
#        is given then the current value of any known option is returned
#        in a form similar (but not identical to) the Tk widget command.
#     insert index item1 item2 ...
#        Insert a list of strings into the scrollboxes at position
#        index. "index" can be 0 or end which inserts at the beginning
#        and at the end. There should be as many items as listboxes.
#        A single list with sufficient elements may be used instead of a
#        separate list.
#     clear first [last]
#        Clears a range of items from the scrollboxes.  If first is
#        "all" then all lines are deleted. If only first is given then
#        this clears a single line. "last" may be set as end.
#     get index
#        Gets the items with the given index from the scrollboxes. If
#        index is "all" then all the items from a scrollbox are
#        returned. The return is a list.
#     size
#        Returns the size of the scrollboxes.
#     bind args
#        Binds the event and procedure in args to all the listboxes. This
#        uses the "bind list" method of the scrollbox.
#     curselection
#        Returns a list of the indices of any items selected from the
#        listboxes.
#     _moveThoughList, _startScanThroughList, _endScanThoughList and
#     _managelists
#        These internal methods manage the scrolling and scanning of
#        the listboxes, in ways similar to the default bindings for
#        Listboxes.

#  Inheritance:
#     This class inherits Ccd_multiscrollbox and its methods and
#     configuration options, which are not directly occluded by those

#  History:
#     19-MAR-1994 (PDRAPER):
#        Original version.
#     4-MAY-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Started move to Tk4.
#     19-MAY-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Now uses Tk4 listbox bindings rather than re-creating
#        own. Listbox control happens only via one routine now (_managelists)
#        that makes sure that listboxes show the same part and have
#        the same selection. Many of the old internal routines for
#        Motif scrolling etc. are now redundant and have been removed.
#     21-JUL-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Fixed bindtags to use top-level ancestor rather than ., dot
#        was picking up binding from adamtask (and destroying everything).
#     12-MAY-2000 (MBT):
#        Upgraded for Tcl8.
#     3-JUL-2001 (MBT):
#        Fixed a bug from Tcl8 upgrade.
