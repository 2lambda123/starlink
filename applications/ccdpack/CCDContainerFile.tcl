   proc CCDContainerFile { ndfname } {
#+
#  Name:
#     CCDContainerFile

#  Purpose:
#     Returns the filename associated with an image.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Description:
#     This routine returns the filename in which an NDF structure lives.
#     Often this will just be the name of the structure with '.sdf'
#     appended, but in the case of HDS container files it may be more
#     complicated.  It works because whenever the ndgexpand command
#     is used to look inside HDS container files, the calling code
#     updates the CCDndfcontainers global array with a record of
#     what NDFs were found in what container files.  If there is no
#     corresponding entry in CCDndfcontainers, this routine returns
#     the input value, since it is presumably the name of a non-HDS file.

#  Arguments:
#     ndfname = string (read)
#        The name of an NDF structure.

#  Global Variables:
#     CCDndfcontainers = array (read)
#        An array mapping every NDF structure so far encountered to its
#        HDS container file.

#  Return Value:
#     The name of the container file in which the NDF structure lives.
