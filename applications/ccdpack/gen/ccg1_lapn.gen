      SUBROUTINE CCG1_LAPN<T>( VAL, NVAL, IAT, BIGL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG1_LAPN

*  Purpose:
*     Insert a list of values into a bigger list.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG1_LAPN( VAL, NVAL, IAT, BIGL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine inserts the array VAL(NVAL) into the array BIGL(*)
*     starting at the positions IAT. 

*  Arguments:
*     VAL( NVAL ) = <COMM> (Given)
*        Values to be inserted in the larger list BIGL
*     NVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of entries in VAL.
*     IAT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Position within BIGL at which the values in VAL are to be
*        inserted.
*     BIGL( * ) = <COMM> (Given and Returned)
*        Array into which the values in VAL are to be inserted. The
*        insertion begins at position IAT, until position IAT+NVAL-1.
*        The calling routine should ensure that BIGL is large enough to
*        contain elements up to IAT+NVAL-1 as no bounds checking is
*        performed by this routine. Elements of BIGL outside of the
*        range are left unmodified.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
