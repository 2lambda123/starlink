      SUBROUTINE FTS1_GKEY<T>( NCARD, BUFFER, SCARD, NAME, THERE, VALUE,
     :                         CARD, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FTS1_GKEYx

*  Purpose:
*     Get the value of a named header of type <COMM> from a buffer of
*     FITS header card images.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FTS1_GKEYx( NCARD, BUFFER, SCARD, NAME, THERE, VALUE, CARD,
*    :                 STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine searches a buffer containing the header card images
*     from a FITS file for card named %NAME; and returns its <COMM>
*     value, %VALUE, and the number of the card image within the buffer
*     array that contains the named keyword.  The search ends when the
*     next end of a header block, marked by the END keyword, is
*     encountered or the buffer is exhausted.  If the keyword is
*     present %THERE is true, otherwise it is false.   Since all images
*     are in character format, type conversion is performed.  An error
*     status will be returned if the conversion has failed.  If the
*     keyword is present more than once in the header, only the first
*     occurence will be used.
*
*     The name may be compound to permit reading of hierarchical
*     keywords.  This routine will also work for HISTORY and COMMENTS
*     provided there is but one value given on the line, i.e. only
*     one "keyword = value" before any comment marker. An error will
*     result otherwise.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of card images in the buffer.
*     BUFFER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * 80 (Given)
*        The buffer containing the header card images.
*     SCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of the card from where the search will begin.  This
*        is needed because the headers make contain a dummy header
*        prior to an extension.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the keyword whose value is required.  This may be
*        a compound name to handle hierarchical keywords, and it has
*        the form keyword1.keyword2.keyword3 etc.  The maximum number of
*        keywords per FITS card is 20.  Comparisons are performed in
*        uppercase and blanks are removed.  Each keyword must be no
*        longer than 8 characters.
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true the keyword %NAME is present.
*     VALUE = <TYPE> (Returned)
*        The value of the keyword.
*     CARD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of the card containing the named keyword.
*        If the card could not be found this is set to zero.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Initialise counter and flag.  Test whether the input name is
*     compound by looking for the delimiter.
*     -  If it is not compound loop for all cards until the last card,
*     or the requested card is located.  Compare each card with the
*     desired keyword.  Once the required card is found set flag to
*     say keyword has been found, convert from a character string to
*     the value, otherwise go to the next card.
*     -  For a compound name loop for all cards until the last card,
*     or the requested card is located.  Go to the next card if the
*     current card does not contain an equals sign.  Generate the
*     compound keyword from the keywords before the equals sign. Compare
*     the compound keyword with the desired name.  Once the required
*     card is found set flag to say keyword has been found, find the
*     extent of the value in the card by finding any comment delimeter,
*     convert from a character string to the value, otherwise go to the
*     next card.
*     -  Reset card number to zero if the keyword is not present

*  Implementation Status:
*     - There is a routine for each of the data types logical, integer,
*     real and double precision: replace "x" in the routine name by
*     L, I, R or D as appropriate.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Cannot handle character data because the arguments to CHR_CTOC
*     are different from the other CHR_CTOx routines.  The imaginary
*     portion of complex data is not processed.
