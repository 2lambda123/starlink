      SUBROUTINE CCG1_COPS<T>( SFIRST, SRC, N, DFIRST, DEST, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG1_COPS<T>

*  Purpose:
*     To copy a section of one vectorised array to another.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG1_COPS<T>( SFIRST, SRC, N, DFIRST, DEST, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     N elements, starting at element SFIRST, are copied from the input
*     array SRC to a section of the output array DEST starting at 
*     element DFIRST.

*  Arguments:
*     SFIRST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first element of the source array to be copied.
*     SRC( * ) = <COMM> (Given)
*        The array to be copied from.
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements to copy.
*     DFIRST = INTEGER (Given)
*        The position in the destination array to which the first element
*        should be copied.
*     DEST( * ) = <COMM> (Returned)
*        The array to be copied into.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Global Status.
