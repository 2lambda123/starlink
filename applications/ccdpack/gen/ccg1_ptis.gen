      SUBROUTINE CCG1_PTIS<T>( STACK, EL, LINES, ILINE, DATA, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG1_PTIS - PuT Into Stack

*  Purpose:
*     To enter a line of data into an array of vectorised lines.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG1_PTIS<T>( STACK, EL, LINES, ILINE, DATA, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine copies the data, pixel by pixel, into the line of
*     STACK. The precisions of the input and output arrays are
*     the same so no difficulties should occur. The array STACK is
*     assumed vectorised in all except the last dimension.

*  Arguments:
*     STACK( EL, LINES ) = <COMM> (Given and Returned)
*        The array to enter the data line into.
*     EL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in the first dimension of the output
*        array. This should be the product of all dimensions except the
*        last.
*     LINES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The last dimension of the output array. This should be the size
*        of the last dimension of the passed array.
*     ILINE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The line number to insert data in.
*     DATA( EL ) = <COMM> (Given)
*        The vectorised line of data to copy into STACK.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
