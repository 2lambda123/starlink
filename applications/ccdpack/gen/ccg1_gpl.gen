      SUBROUTINE CCG1_GPL<T>( ABC, ARR, NCOL, NLINE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG1_GPL<T>

*  Purpose:
*     To generate an array containing a plane.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG1_GPL( ABC, ARR, NCOL, NLINE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine loops over the whole of the output data array
*     generating the values which a plane with coefficients ABC would
*     have at that point.

*  Arguments:
*     ABC( 3 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The coefficients of the equation of the plane.
*     ARR( NCOL, NLINE ) = <TYPE> (Returned)
*        The output array of data with the plane values.
*     NCOL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The first dimension of the data array.
*     NLINE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The second dimension of the output data array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The plane has the form.
*     z = ABC(1)*x + ABC(2)* y + ABC(3)
*     where x and y are the array indices and z is the array value.
