      SUBROUTINE CCG1_KTH<T>( N, K, ARRAY, ANCDAT, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG1_KTH<T>

*  Purpose:
*     Return the Kth smallest value in an array.

*  Language:
*     Fortran-77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG1_KTH<T>( N, K, ARRAY, ANCDAT, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the value of the Kth smallest element in the
*     given array. It is an implementation of an algorithm of Niklaus
*     Wirth from the book "Algorithms + data structures = programs".

*  Arguments:
*     N = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements in the input array.
*     K = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        On entry the ordered value to be returned, on exit index of
*        ARRAY that contain the Kth smallest value.
*     ARRAY( N ) = <TYPE> (Given and Returned)
*        The array of values to be processed. Note this is modified on 
*        exit.
*     ANCDAT( N ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Array of data whose association with ARRAY is to be preserved 
*        (i.e. a list of pointers to the original positions with ARRAY).
*     VALUE = <TYPE> (Returned)
*         The Kth smallest value in the input array.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The global status.
