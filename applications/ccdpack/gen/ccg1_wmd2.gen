*  Name:
*     CCG1_WMD2<T>

*  Purpose:
*     To estimate the mean of a number of normally distributed data
*     values, some of which may be corrupt.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*      CALL CCG1_WMD2<T>( X, W, NX, PBAD, NITER, TOLL, NSIGMA, XMODE,
*                          SIGMA, USED, NUSED, STATUS )

*  Description:
*      Not available. Remember to look in EDRS.

*  Arguments:
*     X( NX ) = <COMM> (Given)
*        An array of data values.
*     W( NX ) = <COMM> (Given)
*        An array of data weights for each data value.  The weights are
*        inversely proportional to the square of the relative errors on
*        each data point.
*     NX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of data values.
*     PBAD = REAL (Given)
*        An estimate of the probability that any one data point will be
*        corrupt.  (This value is not critical.)
*     NITER = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of iterations required.
*     TOLL = REAL (Given)
*        The absolute accuracy required in the estimate of the
*        mean.  Iterations cease when two successive estimates
*        differ by less than this amount.
*     NSIGMA = REAL (Given)
*        The sigma level to reject data values at.
*     XMODE = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        The estimate of the uncorrupted mean.
*     SIGMA = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
*        An estimate of the uncorrupted normalised standard deviation of
*        the data points.  An estimate of the standard deviation of any
*        one point is:  SIGMA / SQRT( W ) where W is its weight.
*     USED( NX ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If a value is not rejected then its corresponding used element
*        will be set true.
*     NUSED = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of the input data values which are actually used.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The global status.

*  History:
*     1981 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     1990 September 25 (MJC):
*        Made generic, renamed from WMODE, added STATUS, commented
*        the variables and converted the prologue.
*     1991 April 4 (PDRAPER):
*        Took from KAPPA and included NSIGMA argument.
*        Changed output to double precision for compatablity.
*     9-APR-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Added counter for number of points used.
*     30-MAY-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Added used array to estimate statistics on image useage.
