#  Name:
#     idicurs.tcl

#  Purpose:
#     Script to do the work for the IDICURS application.

#  Language:
#     Tcl.

#  Description:
#     This script causes the user to be presented with an Ndf viewer 
#     so that points on it may be indicated.

#  External Variables:
#     CENTROID = boolean (Given and Returned)
#        Indicates whether points are centroided when added.
#     DOMAIN = string (Given)
#        The domain in which the ndfset is to be plotted, and in which
#        the POINTS coordinates will be supplied and returned in.
#     ERROR = string (Returned)
#        If returned as a non-empty string, this should give the text
#        of an error to be presented to the user.  This indicates that
#        the routine did not complete successfully.
#     MARKSTYLE = string (Given and Returned)
#        A string, in the form of comma-separated att=value pairs, 
#        indicating how markers should be plotted on the image.
#     MAXCANV = integer (Given and Returned)
#        The maximum X or Y dimension of the canvas in which the initial
#        NDF is to be displayed.  If zero, there is no limit.
#     NDFSET = list of strings (Given)
#        A list of strings of the form {setname ndfname ndfname ...}
#        indicating which NDFs comprise the ndfset to be examined.
#        The setname may be an empty string if there is only one NDF.
#     PERCHI = real (Given and Returned)
#        The percentile of the data above which all values should be 
#        plotted as the same colour.  Must be between 0 and 100.
#     PERCLO = real (Given and Returned)
#        The percentile of the data below which all values should be 
#        plotted as the same colour.  Must be between 0 and 100.
#     POINTS = list of pairs (Given and Returned)
#        A list of the pixel coordinates indicated by the user on the NDF.
#        Each element of the list is of the form {I X Y}, where I is an
#        integer index and X and Y are the coordinates.
#     VERBOSE = integer (Given)
#        If non-zero then the positions of all the points will be written
#        through the CCDPACK log system at the end.
#     WINX = integer (Given and Returned)
#        X dimension of the window used for NDF display.
#     WINY = integer (Given and Returned)
#        Y dimension of the window used for NDF display.
#     ZOOM = real (Given and Returned)
#        The zoom factor for NDF display; may be limited by the value of
#        MAXCANV.
