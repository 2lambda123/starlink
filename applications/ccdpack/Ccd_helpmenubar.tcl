#  Name:
#     Ccd::menubarhelp

#  Purpose:
#     Defines the "class of menubar with Help".

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Description:
#     This class is an extension of Ccd::menubar that also performs the
#     standard configuration of the Help system. It is NOT a general
#     widget as it contains CCDPACK specific information.

#  Configuration Options:
#     See Ccd::menubar.

#  Inheritance:
#     This class inherits Ccd::menubar and its methods and configuration
#     options, which are not directly occluded by those specified here.

#  Invocations:
#        Ccd::menubarhelp window [-option value]...
#
#     This command create an instance of a menubar with help and returns a
#     command "window" for manipulating it via the methods and
#     configuration options described below. Configuration options may
#     be appended to the command.
#
#        window configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the widget
#     instance has been created).
#
#        window method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this widget.

#  Methods:
#     constructor [-option value]...
#        This method is invoked automatically by the class command and
#         creates the "class " widget with a default configuration,
#         except when overridden by command line options.
#     destructor
#        Destroys the "class" instance, invoked by the "delete" method.
#     configure [-option value]...
#        Activates the configuration options. If no configuration value
#         is given then the current value of any known option is returned
#         in a form similar (but not identical to) the Tk widget command.
#     sethelpitem item document label
#        Sets the help file to associate with a help item. Item is the
#        name of the help label. "document" the name of the document to
#        be read (for instance, ccdpack or sun139) and label the xlabel
#        in the HTML document to be read. The document index file is
#        scanned to locate the appropriate part. All documents are
#        assumed to be located under the directories stored in the
#        global variable CCDstarhtml.
#     showhelpitem name
#        Displays any help available for the Help menu item labelled
#        "$name".
