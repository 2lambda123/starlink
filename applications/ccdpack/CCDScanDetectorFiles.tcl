   proc CCDScanDetectorFiles { Box } {
#+
#  Name:
#     CCDScanDetectorFiles

#  Purpose:
#     Locates and types Detector files.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     This procedure tries to locate files in the directories whose
#     name are contained in the CCDdetectorcache global variable. The
#     files should have a type of .DAT and are assumed to contain
#     restoration file details or be an FITS import table.
#
#     To determine which files are which they are scanned for a
#     signature of 'keyword = '. This indicates a restoration file,
#     others are assumed to be import control tables.
#
#     After the type of the file is determined its name is entered
#     into a Ccd::multitem whose name is $Box together with the
#     description "No description available (type)" if the first line
#     of the file is just an empty comment, otherwise the first line is
#     shown as a description (again with the type appended in ()). The
#     types are identified by the strings "setup" and "table".

#  Arguments:
#     Box = window (read)
#       Name of a size 2 Ccd::multitem. The name of any files located
#       together with a description are entered into this.

#  Returns:
#     False if no files are located.
