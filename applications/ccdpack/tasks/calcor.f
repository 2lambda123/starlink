      SUBROUTINE CALCOR( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CALCOR

*  Purpose:
*     Subtracts a scaled dark or flash calibration image from a series of
*     images.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CALCOR( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     CALCOR subtracts dark or flash calibration data from a series of
*     bias-corrected images. The calibration data are multiplied by a
*     constant before subtraction, so that calibration data which have
*     been normalised to counts per unit of time per pixel, can be
*     scaled to the "exposure" times suitable for correcting the input
*     data. If the calibration frame data levels are already correct
*     to perform the necessary correction then the data should be
*     scaled by a factor of one. In addition to subtracting the
*     calibration data CALCOR also processes saturated values
*     protecting them from modification. This protection is necessary
*     if the saturated pixels are not to become differentiated.

*  Usage:
*     calcor in out cal expose [preserve] [title]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     CAL = LITERAL (Read)
*        Name of the image containing the calibration data, this would
*        normally be the output from MAKECAL. The data should be
*        normalised to one exposure unit. It is expected that the
*        calibration image contains dark or flash exposure CCD data
*        which have been bias corrected.
*
*        The name of this file may be specified using indirection
*        through a file.
*        [Global calibration image]
*     EXPOSE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of (comma separated) values specifying the numbers by
*        which the calibration data need to be multiplied before
*        subtraction from the input data. These are the "exposure"
*        factors for the dark counts expected in the input data or the
*        flash exposure times. If the calibration data have been
*        normalised to reflect the number of counts per second of time,
*        then this is the number of seconds of flash exposure or the
*        number of seconds duration between readouts, if it is a dark
*        counts image.  If the calibration image has been produced so
*        that the correct levels are already present, then these values
*        should be returned as one. A quick method of specifying that
*        all the images have the same "exposure" factors is to return a
*        single value, this will then be used for all input images.
*
*        The given values must be in the same order as the input images.
*        Indirection through an ASCII file may be used.  If more than
*        one line is required to enter the information then a
*        continuation line may be requested by adding "-" to the end of
*        the last value.
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        Names of the images to be processed. The calibration data will be
*        scaled and subtracted from these.  The image names should be
*        separated by commas and may include wildcards.
*
*        NOTE the use of wildcards with this program is NOT recommended
*        unless the input images all have the same calibration exposure
*        factors. The processing order of any wildcarded images cannot
*        be guaranteed.
*     KEEPIN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether to keep (i.e. not delete) the input images (parameter IN)
*        or not. Deleting the input images has the advantage of saving
*        disk space, but should probably only be used if this program
*        is part of a sequence of commands and the intermediary data
*        produced by it are not important.
*
*        The calibration master frame (parameter CAL) is never deleted.
*
*        The default for this parameter is TRUE and this cannot be
*        overridden except by assignment on the command line or in
*        reponse to a forced prompt.
*        [TRUE]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     OUT = LITERAL (Read)
*        Names of the output images. These may be specified as list of
*        comma separated names, using indirection if required, OR,
*        as a single modification element (of the input names).
*        The simplest modification element is the asterisk "*" which
*        means call each of the output images the same name as the
*        corresponding input images. So,
*           IN > *
*           OUT > *
*        signifies that all the images in the current directory should be
*        used and the output images should have the same names.
*
*        Other types of modification can also occur, such as,
*           OUT > tmp_*
*        which means call the output images the same as the input images but
*        put tmp_ in front of the names. Replacement of a specified
*        string with another in the output file names can also be used,
*           OUT > tmp_*|debias|flattened|
*        this replaces the string debias with flattened in any of the
*        output names tmp_*.
*
*        NOTE the use of wildcards with this program is not recommended
*        unless the input images all have the same calibration exposure
*        factors. The order of processing of any wildcarded images cannot
*        be guaranteed.
*     PRESERVE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If the input data type is to be preserved and used for
*        processing then this parameter should be set TRUE.
*        If this parameter is set FALSE then the input data will be
*        processed and returned in a suitable floating point
*        representation. This option is useful if the output data will
*        have a significant number of BAD values due to numeric errors
*        (over or under flow), or if unacceptable loss of precision
*        will occur if the data are processed in their initial data type
*        (due to rounding errors).
*
*        Note if a global value for this parameter has been set, using
*        CCDSETUP, then this will be used.
*        [TRUE]
*     SATURATION = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The data saturation value, if it has been applied. See SETSAT.
*        [1.0D6]
*     SETSAT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If the input data have had a saturation value applied then
*        this parameter should be given as TRUE. If the input data
*        have been processed within CCDPACK then the saturation value
*        will have been stored within the CCDPACK extension, if this
*        is so then this value will be used. Note that data with
*        different saturation properties (i.e. values) which have not
*        been set within CCDPACK will require separate processing
*        (i.e. in groups with the same properties -- see notes).
*        [FALSE]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output images.
*        [Output from CALCOR].

*  Examples:
*     calcor frame1 frame2 calibration 250
*        This example runs CALCOR in its most basic mode. The input data
*        in image frame1 has the data in image calibration subtracted, after
*        multiplying by 250. The resultant data is written to image
*        frame2. Note that if saturation values have been applied to the
*        data in frame1 within CCDPACK, then this will be handled
*        automatically. The output data will be of the same type as the
*        input data.
*
*     calcor in=^frames.dat out='*_darksub' cal=dark_master
*            expose=^dark_exposures
*        In this example a list of images are sequentially processed. The
*        list of image names is stored in the file frames.dat. The output
*        images are named after the corresponding input image with the
*        characters _darksub appended. The dark times for each input
*        frame are read from the file dark_exposures. This is the
*        recommended method for processing lists of input images.
*
*     calcor l1551_f11 l1551_f11_ds dark_master 1.0 preserve=false
*            logto=both logfile=l1551_darkcor.log
*            title=dark_corrected_data
*        This example follows a similar theme to the first example,
*        except that the output data type is now _REAL or _DOUBLE,
*        depending on the precision required to process the data. The
*        calibration correction data are assumed to have the right
*        exposure factor. The output image is given the title
*        "dark_corrected_data" and the parameters used by CALCOR are
*        stored in the logfile l1551_darkcor.log.
*
*     calcor in=ngc4151r_f1 cal=flash_master out=ngc4151r_f1_dc
*            expose=310.0 setsat saturation=32767
*        In this example a saturation value external to CCDPACK has
*        been applied to the input image. This is indicated by setting
*        SETSAT TRUE and by supplying the saturation value. Values
*        which are greater than or equal to the saturation value are
*        left unmodified by the calibration frame subtraction. This may
*        leave the saturated values "displaced" from the local values,
*        causing a discontinuity in the local isophotes, but is the
*        only method by which the saturated pixels may still be
*        readily identified after the subtraction of the calibration
*        frame.

*  Implementation Status:
*     - Supports processing of all non-complex numeric types.
*       BAD pixels are processed as are all NDF components.

*  Notes:
*     - If any of the input data have had their saturation values set
*       by applications not within CCDPACK, then this routine will
*       require the saturation value which has been used if the values
*       are to be propagated properly. If more than one saturation
*       value has been used then the input frames will need to be
*       processed singly. This is because CALCOR only uses one
*       saturation value per input group. If the saturation values
*       have been set within CCDPACK (by DEBIAS) these will be
*       processed correctly and may be different.

*  Behaviour of parameters:
*     Most parameters retain their current value as default. The
*     "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
*     application. If the application has not been run then the
*     "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
*     The exceptions to this rule are:
*        - TITLE   -- always "Output from CALCOR"
*        - KEEPIN  -- always TRUE
*
*     Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
*     define the default behaviour of the application but does mean
*     that additional care needs to be taken when using the application
*     on new datasets/different devices, or after a break of sometime.
*     The intrinsic default behaviour of the application may be
*     restored by using the RESET keyword on the command line.
*
*     Certain parameters (LOGTO, LOGFILE, PRESERVE and CAL) have
*     global values. These global values will always take precedence,
*     except when an assignment is made on the command line.  In general
*     global values may be set and reset using the CCDSETUP and
*     CCDCLEAR commands, however, the CAL parameter may only be set by
*     a run of the application MAKECAL.
