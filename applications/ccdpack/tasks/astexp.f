      SUBROUTINE ASTEXP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTEXP

*  Purpose:
*     Exports coordinate system information from images.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTEXP( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This task exports coordinate system information from a set of NDFs,
*     writing it to an AST file.  For each NDF a frameset is written 
*     containing information about how to map between a selected Base
*     frame and the NDF's Current frame.  Each frameset is identified 
*     by a key which is derived from the NDF itself, and matches keys 
*     which can be derived from other NDFs to which similar framesets 
*     ought to apply.  The key should be generated in the same way when 
*     the AST file is used for importing the mapping information by
*     ASTIMP.  Currently these keys can be generated according to a
*     FITS header card or the order in which the NDFs are presented.
*     Additional information may be written describing what use to 
*     make of FITS headers in the NDFs.
*
*     Used together, the framesets written out to an AST file can thus
*     contain information about the positioning of images in a set of
*     related NDFs.
*
*     AST files written out by this program can be applied to
*     other NDFs of similar origin using the ASTIMP program, so 
*     that registration information present in the WCS components of 
*     one set of NDFs (put there for instance by the REGISTER or
*     WCSEDIT programs) can be transferred using ASTIMP and ASTEXP to
*     another similar set.  This "similar set" will typically be one
*     from chips in the same mosaic camera instrument.
*
*     A 2-frame frameset is output for each NDF.  The Base frame is one
*     selected by the BASEFRAME parameter, and is identical in the 
*     exported frameset to the one in the original NDF.  The Current frame
*     in the exported frameset is the same as the Current frame in the
*     original NDF, but may be given a different Domain name by the 
*     OUTDOMAIN parameter.
*     
*     Under normal circumstances, the Current frames of all the input
*     NDFs should share the same Domain name, and so should the frames
*     identified by the BASEFRAME parameter.   A warning will be issued 
*     if this is not the case.  Warnings will also be issued if the NDF 
*     identifiers are not all unique.

*  Usage:
*     ASTEXP in astfile outdomain baseframe

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ASTFILE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the AST file to be written.
*     BASEEPOCH = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        If a "Sky Co-ordinate System" specification is supplied (using
*        parameter BASEFRAME) for a celestial co-ordinate system, then
*        an epoch value is needed to qualify it. This is the epoch at
*        which the supplied sky positions were determined. It should be
*        given as a decimal years value, with or without decimal places
*        ("1996.8" for example). Such values are interpreted as a
*        Besselian epoch if less than 1984.0 and as a Julian epoch
*        otherwise.
*     BASEFRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter specifies the WCS frame from the NDFs
*        relative to which the Current frames will be defined in the 
*        output AST file.  To be useful, this must specify a frame 
*        which occurs in all the NDFs in the IN list, and can be 
*        expected to occur in any NDF to which the AST file will 
*        later be applied using ASTIMP.
*
*        The value of the parameter can be one of the following:
*        - A domain name such as SKY, AXIS, PIXEL, etc.
*        - An integer value giving the index of the required Frame
*          within the WCS component.
*        - A "Sky Co-ordinate System" (SCS) value such as EQUAT(J2000)
*          (see section "Sky Co-ordinate Systems" in SUN/95).
*        A domain name is usually the most suitable choice.
*
*        Unlike the Current frame, the frame selected using this
*        parameter is copied to the AST file unmodified; in particular
*        it retains the same Domain name.
*        [PIXEL]
*     FITSID = LITERAL (Read)
*        If the IDTYPE parameter has the value FITSID, this parameter
*        gives the FITS header keyword whose value distinguishes
*        frames with different coordinate system information.
*        If any lower case characters are given, they are converted 
*        to upper case.  This may be a compound name to handle 
*        hierarchical keywords, in which case it has the form 
*        keyword1.keyword2 etc.  Each keyword must be no longer than 
*        8 characters.
*     FITSROT = LITERAL (Read)
*        If this parameter is not null, it gives the name of a FITS
*        header keyword whose value gives a number of degrees to 
*        rotate the coordinate system by when it is imported.
*        If any lower case characters are given, they are converted 
*        to upper case.  This may be a compound name to handle 
*        hierarchical keywords, in which case it has the form 
*        keyword1.keyword2 etc.  Each keyword must be no longer than 
*        8 characters.
*        [!]
*     IDTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter destermines the form of the ID value which 
*        distinguishes the framesets from each other in the exported
*        AST file.  It may have one of the following values:
*           -  FITSID  -- ID is generated from FITS header (see also
*                         the FITSID parameter).
*           -  INDEX   -- ID is given by an integer as taken from the
*                         INDICES parameter.  This normally gives the
*                         frameset generated from the N'th NDF in the
*                         IN list an ID with index N.
*        [INDEX]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of NDFs from which framesets are to be extracted.
*        The Current frame of each should normally be the same, and 
*        should be a frame in which the different NDFs are correctly 
*        registered.  The NDF names may be specified using wildcards, 
*        or may be specified using an indirection file (the indirection 
*        character is "^").
*     INDICES( * ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        If IDTYPE is set to INDEX, then this parameter is a list of 
*        integers with as many elements as there are NDFs accessed by 
*        the IN parameter.  It gives the sequence of indices N to be 
*        used for generating the ID values.   If set null (!) the 
*        NDFs will be considered in the order 1,2,3,... which will 
*        normally be appropriate unless the NDFs are being presented 
*        in an order different from that in which they are likely to 
*        be presented to ASTIMP.
*        [!]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     OUTDOMAIN = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter gives the name of the new alignment domain for
*        the frames written out to the AST file.  It is a good idea
*        to choose a value which is not likely to exist previously
*        in the WCS components of the NDFs to which ASTFILE will be
*        applied.  A suitable value might be the name of the 
*        instrument from which the NDFs are obtained.
*
*        Note that the frames which are written to the AST file are
*        always the Current frames of the NDFs supplied; this
*        parameter only gives the name that the frames will have in
*        the AST file, and consequently the name by which they will be
*        known when the WCS information is imported into other NDFs
*        using ASTIMP.
*
*        The name is converted to upper case, and whitespace is removed.
*        [CCD_EXPORT]

*  Examples:
*     astexp reg_data* camera.ast idtype=fitsid fitsid=CHIPNUM 
*            outdomain=camera
*        This will save the information about the relative positioning
*        of the NDFs 'reg_data*' to the file 'camera.ast', calling the
*        alignment domain 'CAMERA'.  The file 'camera.ast' can later be
*        used by the ASTIMP application to add the same coordinate 
*        information to a different set of NDFs from the same instrument.
*        Before running this, the NDFs 'reg_data*' should be correctly
*        aligned in their Current domain.  CHIPNUM must be the name 
*        of a FITS header keyword present in the FITS extension of each
*        NDF whose value distinguishes the CCDs from each other 
*        (presumably present in the unreduced data).  The mappings 
*        between the pixel coordinates and Current coordinates of the
*        input NDFs are recorded.
*
*     astexp "im1,im2,im3" astfile=camera.ast baseframe=axis 
*            title="Focal plane alignment" accept
*        In this case the OUTDOMAIN parameter takes its default value
*        of 'CCD_EXPORT', but mappings are between the Current
*        coordinates of the input NDFs and their 'AXIS' coordinates.
*        This could be a good idea if the images had been shrunk using
*        KAPPA's COMPAVE or something similar, which modifies the
*        PIXEL coordinates but leaves the AXIS coordinates unchanged.
*        No suitable FITS header is available to distinguish the
*        different types of NDF, so the IDTYPE parameter is allowed to
*        assume its default value of INDEX.  When camera.ast is used
*        for importing frameset information, the NDFs from the three
*        different chips must be listed in the same order as when this
*        command was invoked.  The title of the output Current frame
*        will be as given.
*
*     astexp "r10595[2345]" wfc.ast outdomain=wfc 
*            idtype=fitsid fitsid=CHIPNAME fitsrot=ROTSKYPA
*        This exports the alignment information from the four named
*        NDFs to a file wfc.ast.  The CHIPNAME FITS header identifies
*        the source CCD for each, and the ROTSKYPA FITS header gives
*        a number of degrees to rotate each frame additional to the
*        relative alignment information.

*  Notes:
*     AST file format:
*        The AST file is designed to be written by ASTEXP and read by
*        ASTIMP, and the user does not need to understand its format.
*        It is however a text file, and if care is taken it may be
*        edited by hand.  Removing entire framesets and modifying ID 
*        values or domain names may be done fairly easily, but care
*        should be taken (see SUN/210) if any more involved changes
*        are to be undertaken.  The format of the file is explained 
*        here.
*
*        The AST file consists of the following, in order:
*
*           <global modifiers>
*           (blank line)
*           <frameset 1>
*           <frameset 1 modifiers>
*           (blank line)
*           <frameset 2>
*           <frameset 2 modifiers>
*           (blank line)
*             ...
*           (end of file)
*
*        Characters after a '#' character are normally ignored.  The 
*        constituent parts are composed as follows:
*
*        Blank line: 
*           A single blank line, which may contain spaces but no comments.
*
*        Frameset:
*           The framesets are written in AST native format, as explained
*           in SUN/210.
*
*           Each frameset has an ID, and contains two frames (a Base 
*           frame and a Current frame) and a mapping between them.  
*           The domains of all the Base frames should normally be the 
*           same, and likewise for all the Current frames.  For the 
*           NDFs to which the file will be applied by ASTIMP, their 
*           WCS components should contain frames in the same domain 
*           as the AST file's Base frame.
*
*           The ID of each frameset is used to determine, for each NDF,
*           which of the framesets in the file should be applied to it.
*           This ID is a string which can assume one of the following 
*           forms:
*
*           -  "FITSID KEY VALUE"
*                 This will match an NDF if the first FITS header card
*                 with the keyword KEY has the value VALUE.  If the 
*                 value is of type CHARACTER it must be in single 
*                 quotes. KEY may be compound (of the form 
*                 keyword1.keyword2 etc) to permit reading of 
*                 hierarchical keywords.
*
*           -  "INDEX N"
*                 This associates a frameset with an integer N.  
*                 Usually N will take the values 1,2,3,... for the 
*                 framesets in the file.  Typically the N'th NDF in a 
*                 list will match the one with an ID of "INDEX N".
*
*        Modifiers:
*           Modifiers describe additional modifications to be made
*           to the framesets on import.  They are of the form 
*
*              USE keyword arguments
*
*           Currently the only modifier defined is FITSROT, which 
*           defines the name of a FITS header which specifies how
*           many degrees to rotate the image before use.  This 
*           rotation is carried out after the mapping defined by
*           the frameset itself.
*
*           Global modifiers affect all NDFs processed with the AST 
*           file.  Frameset modifiers affect only those NDFs which 
*           correspond to their frameset.
*
*        Rigorous error checking of the AST file is not performed, so
*        that unhelpful modifications to the WCS components of the 
*        target NDFs may occur if it is not in accordance with these
*        requirements.

*  Behaviour of parameters:
*     Most parameters retain their current value as default. The
*     "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
*     application. If the application has not been run then the
*     "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
*
*     Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
*     define the default behaviour of the application but does mean
*     that additional care needs to be taken when using the application
*     on new datasets or after a break of sometime.  The intrinsic
*     default behaviour of the application may be restored by using the
*     RESET keyword on the command line.
*
*     Certain parameters (LOGTO and LOGFILE) have global values.
*     These global values will always take precedence, except when an 
*     assignment is made on the command line.  Global values may be set 
*     and reset using the CCDSETUP and CCDCLEAR commands.
