      SUBROUTINE ASTIMP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTIMP

*  Purpose:
*     Imports coordinate system information into NDFs.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTIMP( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This task reads coordinate system information from an AST file
*     and uses it to modify the World Coordinate System (WCS)
*     components of the given NDFs.  A new coordinate system is added
*     (the same for each NDF) within which a set of NDFs can be
*     aligned.  The newly added coordinate system becomes the Current
*     one.
*
*     If a coordinate system with the same Domain (name) already
*     exists it will be overwritten, and a warning message issued.
*
*     AST files for use by this program will normally be those 
*     written by the ASTEXP program, and may either be standard
*     ones designed for use with a particular instrument, or prepared
*     by the user.

*  Usage:
*     ASTIMP in astfile indomain

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ASTFILE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A file containing a sequence of framesets describing the 
*        relative coordinate systems of NDFs from different sources.  
*
*        It is intended that this file should be one written by the 
*        ASTEXP application when a successful registration is made,
*        and the user need not be aware of its internal structure.
*        The files are readable text however, and can in principle be
*        written by other applications or doctored by hand, if this
*        is done with care, and with knowledge of AST objects (SUN/210).
*        The format of the file is explained in the Notes section.
*     FITSROT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of a FITS header keyword whose value gives a number
*        of degrees to rotate the coordinate system by when it is
*        imported.  This rotation is done after the mappings given in
*        the AST file  itself have been applied.  If any lower case
*        characters are given, they are converted to upper case.  This
*        may be a compound name to handle hierarchical keywords, in
*        which case it has the form keyword1.keyword2 etc.  Each
*        keyword must be no longer than 8 characters.
*
*        It will normally not be necessary to supply this keyword,
*        since it can be given instead within the AST file.  If it is
*        supplied however, it overrides any value given there.
*        [!]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of NDF names whose WCS components are to be modified 
*        according to ASTFILE.  The NDF names may be specified using 
*        wildcards, or may be specified using an indirection file 
*        (the indirection character is "^").
*     INDICES( * ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        This parameter is a list of integers with as many elements as
*        there are NDFs accessed by the IN parameter.  If the frameset
*        identifiers are of the type 'INDEX' then it indicates, for 
*        each NDF, what its index number is.  Thus if only one NDF is
*        given in the IN list, and the value of INDICES is [3], then
*        the frameset with the identifier 'INDEX 3' will be chosen. 
*        If set null (!) the NDFs will be considered in the order
*        1,2,3,... which will be appropriate unless the NDFs are being 
*        presented in a different order from that in which they were 
*        presented to ASTEXP when generating the AST file.
*        [!]
*     INDOMAIN = LITERAL (Read)
*        The Domain name to be used for the Current frames of the 
*        framesets which are imported.  If a null (!) value is given, 
*        the frames will assume the same name as in the AST file.
*        [!]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     ROT = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        A fixed angle in degrees through which all the imported
*        frames  should be rotated.  This rotation is done after the
*        mappings in the AST file itself have been applied.
*        [0]

*  Examples:
*     astimp data* camera.ast
*        This will apply the AST file "camera.ast" to all the NDFs in
*        the current directory with names beginning "data".  The file 
*        "camera.ast" has previously been written using ASTEXP with
*        the parameter ASTFILE=camera.ast.  A new coordinate system,
*        with a name that was determined when the AST file was written,
*        is attached to each NDF.
*
*     astimp "data3,data4" instrum.ast indomain=obs1 indices=[3,4]
*        This imports frameset information from the AST file
*        instrum.ast which was written by ASTEXP with the IDTYPE
*        parameter set to INDEX.  In this case NDFs of only the third
*        and fourth types described in that file are being modified.
*        The name of the new coordinate system will be OBS1,
*        overriding the name used when the AST file was written.
*
*     astimp astfile=instrum.ast in=! logto=terminal accept
*        This will simply report on the framesets contained within
*        the AST file "instrum.ast", writing the ID of each to the 
*        terminal only.

*  Notes:
*     AST file format:
*        The AST file is designed to be written by ASTEXP and read by
*        ASTIMP or MAKESET, and the user does not need to understand
*        its format.  It is however a text file, and if care is taken
*        it may be edited by hand.  Removing entire framesets and 
*        modifying ID values or domain names may be done fairly easily,
*        but care should be taken (see SUN/210) if any more involved 
*        changes are to be undertaken.  The format of the file is 
*        explained here.
*
*        The AST file consists of the following, in order:
*
*           <global modifiers>
*           (blank line)
*           <frameset 1>
*           <frameset 1 modifiers>
*           (blank line)
*           <frameset 2>
*           <frameset 2 modifiers>
*           (blank line)
*             ...
*           (end of file)
*
*        Characters after a '#' character are normally ignored.  The
*        constituent parts are composed as follows:
*
*        Blank line:
*           A single blank line, which may contain spaces but no comments.
*
*        Frameset:
*           The framesets are written in AST native format, as explained
*           in SUN/210.
*
*           Each frameset has an ID, and contains two frames (a Base
*           frame and a Current frame) and a mapping between them.
*           The domains of all the Base frames should normally be the
*           same, and likewise for all the Current frames.  For the
*           NDFs to which the file will be applied by ASTIMP, their
*           WCS components should contain frames in the same domain
*           as the AST file's Base frame.
*
*           The ID of each frameset is used to determine, for each NDF,
*           which of the framesets in the file should be applied to it.
*           This ID is a string which can assume one of the following
*           forms:
*
*           -  "FITSID KEY VALUE"
*                 This will match an NDF if the first FITS header card
*                 with the keyword KEY has the value VALUE.  If the
*                 value is of type CHARACTER it must be in single
*                 quotes. KEY may be compound (of the form
*                 keyword1.keyword2 etc) to permit reading of
*                 hierarchical keywords.
*
*           -  "INDEX N"
*                 This associates a frameset with an integer N.
*                 Usually N will take the values 1,2,3,... for the
*                 framesets in the file.  Typically the N'th NDF in a
*                 list will match the one with an ID of "INDEX N".
*
*           -  "SET N"
*                 This will match an NDF if the Set Index attribute
*                 in its CCDPACK Set header is equal to the integer N.
*
*        Modifiers:
*           Modifiers describe additional modifications to be made
*           to the framesets on import.  They are of the form
*
*              USE keyword arguments
*
*           Currently the only modifier defined is FITSROT, which
*           defines the name of a FITS header which specifies how
*           many degrees to rotate the image before use.  This
*           rotation is carried out after the mapping defined by
*           the frameset itself.
*
*           Global modifiers affect all NDFs processed with the AST
*           file.  Frameset modifiers affect only those NDFs which
*           correspond to their frameset.
*
*        Rigorous error checking of the AST file is not performed, so
*        that unhelpful modifications to the WCS components of the
*        target NDFs may occur if it is not in accordance with these
*        requirements.

*  Behaviour of Parameters:
*     Most parameters retain their current value as default. The
*     "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
*     application. If the application has not been run then the
*     "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
*
*     Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
*     define the default behaviour of the application but does mean
*     that additional care needs to be taken when using the application
*     on new datasets or after a break of sometime.  The intrinsic
*     default behaviour of the application may be restored by using the
*     RESET keyword on the command line.
*
*     Certain parameters (LOGTO and LOGFILE) have global values.
*     These global values will always take precedence, except when an 
*     assignment is made on the command line.  Global values may be set 
*     and reset using the CCDSETUP and CCDCLEAR commands.
