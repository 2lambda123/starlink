      SUBROUTINE CCDNDFAC( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCDNDFAC

*  Purpose:
*     Accesses a list of NDFs and writes their names to a file.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCDNDFAC( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine accesses a list of NDFs and writes their names to a
*     text file. It is intended to be used as an aid to producing
*     procedures which require the facilities of NDF list access used
*     in CCDPACK. For this reason the usual application introductory
*     message is suppressed. The names of the NDFs may be written
*     out to the terminal as an aid to memory. If no NDFs are accessed
*     then the output file will not be created, testing for the 
*     existence of this file is a platform independent way of 
*     determining if the invocation has been successful.

*  Usage:
*     ccdndfac namelist echo

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ECHO = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then the names of the NDFs will be written to the
*        terminal unless there is only one input NDF.
*        [TRUE]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of NDF names. The NDF names should be separated 
*        by commas and may include wildcards.
*        [!]
*     MAXNDF = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The maximum number of NDFs which should be accessed. If a null
*        return "!" is given for this parameter then the normal CCDPACK
*        limit will be applied.
*        [!]
*     NAMELIST = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the output file to contain the names of the
*        accessed NDFs.
*        [CCDNDFAC.LIS]

*  Examples:
*     ccdndfac ndf_name_list true
*        In this example the list of NDF names is written to
*        ndf_name_list and the NDF names are echoed to the terminal. No
*        constraint is placed on the number of NDFs accessed (other than
*        the normal CCDPACK limit).
*
*     ccdndfac ndf_name true maxndf=1
*        In this example only a single NDF name is accessed. The name is
*        not echoed to the terminal (even though echo is set TRUE).

*  Behaviour of Parameters:
*     All parameters retain their current value as default. The
*     "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
*     application. If the application has not been run then the
*     "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
*
*     Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
*     define the default behaviour of the application. The intrinsic
*     default behaviour of the application may be restored by using the
*     RESET keyword on the command line (you may well want to do this
*     when using the application from a procedure).
*
*     Certain parameters (LOGTO and LOGFILE) have global values. These
*     global values will always take precedence, except when an
*     assignment is made on the command line. Global values may be set
*     and reset using the CCDSETUP and CCDCLEAR commands.
