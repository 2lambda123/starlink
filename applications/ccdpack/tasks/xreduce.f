      SUBROUTINE XREDUCE( PID, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     XREDUCE

*  Purpose:
*     Starts up the XREDUCE command.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL XREDUCE( PID, STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     PID = CHARACTER * ( * )
*        The PID string for any process created by the SLV routines
*        (not used in this routine).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine runs up the XREDUCE application. It is necessary
*     as we need to run all commands as task under IRAF/CL. This
*     ensures that we share the same environment (variables) as CL.

*  Usage:
*     RUNXREDUCE

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     NONE

*  Notes:
*     This routine is undocumented. It should work as described in the
*     XREDUCE documentation, except that the process is run in the
*     background, so that it doesn't block other CL interactions.
