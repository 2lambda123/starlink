      SUBROUTINE DEBIAS( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DEBIAS

*  Purpose:
*     Performs the debiassing and initial preparation of CCD
*     data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DEBIAS( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine debiasses CCD frames, masks defects, sets variances,
*     corrects for CCD gain and deferred charge, sets saturated values
*     and extracts the useful portion of the CCD data.
*
*     The debiassing section operates in two basic modes -- with and
*     without a bias frame. If a bias frame is supplied then it is
*     subtracted from the data arrays of the input NDFs. The subtraction
*     can either be direct, or by offsetting the values of the bias by
*     the mean value in the bias-strip region(s). When determining
*     the mean in the bias strips a function of the distance from the
*     edges is used, this reduces the effect of any contamination. If
*     you are offsetting to the bias strip mean then the bias frame
*     should be averaged to zero (MAKEBIAS does this).
*
*     The second debiassing method which DEBIAS supports is the
*     subtraction of interpolated values. The interpolation is
*     performed between the bias strips. If only one strip is given the
*     interpolation is really an extrapolation and is limited to
*     constant values either for each line or for the frame as a whole.
*     Interpolation between bias strips can be as for a single strip or
*     may be a straight line fit for each line, or a fit of a plane to
*     the bias strips (see parameter SMODE). The interpolation uses
*     weighting operations as for bias frame subtraction. Bad values
*     can also be rejected from the strips by sigma clipping, or the
*     noise can be reduced by smoothing the values.
*
*     Additional DEBIAS functionality includes the (optional)
*     production of variance estimates for the input CCD data. It does
*     this by assuming Poissonian statistics for the bias-subtracted
*     data, together with a contribution for the readout noise. The
*     masking of bad data areas is achieved using the transfer of
*     quality information from an NDF, or by using an ASCII Regions
*     Definition (ARD) file. The expansion of the data values into
*     counts and the extraction of the useful area of the CCD are also
*     performed.

*  Usage:
*     debias in out bias [bounds] rnoise adc [mask]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ADC = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The Analogue-to-Digital Conversion factor. This number converts
*        input ADUs to detected electrons. This value is used to
*        estimate the Poissonian noise in the output (debiassed) data
*        values. If variances are not being generated then this value
*        will not be used.
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using
*        CCDSETUP then this will be used.
*        [1.0]
*     BADBITS = _INTEGER (Read)
*        If the first input NDF has no quality component, and you have
*        specified the SETBAD= FALSE option, you will be requested to
*        supply a value for BADBITS (SUN/33).  The default for this
*        is 1. BADBITS is a byte value and hence can only be in the
*        range 0-255.
*        [1]
*     BIAS = LITERAL (Read)
*        Name of the NDF which contains the bias calibration data. This
*        parameter may be specified as ! in which case either a
*        constant or values derived from the bias strip(s) are used.
*        The name of this file may be specified using indirection
*        through an ASCII file. The offered default is either the last
*        used master bias name or (if one exists) the name of the NDF
*        produced by the last run of MAKEBIAS.
*        [Global master bias or !]
*     BOUNDS( 2 or 4 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The pixel indices (see notes) of the upper and lower bounds of
*        the bias strip(s). These bounds can run in either the
*        horizontal or vertical directions. The direction is controlled
*        by the DIRECTION parameter. The bounds must be supplied in
*        pairs. Pixel indices are the actual number of pixels, starting
*        at 1,1 at the lower left hand corner of the NDF data array,
*        which includes any origin offsets within the input NDFs.
*
*        If global values for these bounds have been set using
*        CCDSETUP then those values will be used.
*     BOXSIZE( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The sizes of the sides of the box to be used when smoothing the
*        bias strips. Only used when CMODE="BOX".
*        [15,15]
*     CMODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The "clean-up" mode for the bias strips. This parameter may
*        take values of "BOX", "SIGMA" or "WEIGHT". If CMODE="BOX" then
*        the bias strips are smoothed with a box filter before being
*        processed. If CMODE="SIGMA" then the bias strips are sigma
*        clipped before being processed. If CMODE="WEIGHT" then only
*        the weighting as indicated by the WMODE parameter is used to
*        attempt to decrease the effects of erroneous pixel values.
*        [BOX]
*     DEFERRED = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The deferred charge value. This is also often known as the
*        "fat" or "skinny" zero. It represents the amount of charge
*        left behind in a pixel on a readout transfer. This value is
*        subtracted from the data.
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using
*        CCDSETUP then this will be used.
*        [0.0]
*     DIRECTION = LITERAL (Read)
*        The readout direction of the CCD. This parameter can take
*        values of "X" or "Y". X indicates that the readout direction is
*        horizontal , Y indicates that the readout direction is
*        vertical. The BOUNDS parameter values are assumed to be values
*        along the readout direction.
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using
*        CCDSETUP then this will be used.
*        [X]
*     EXPAND = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This value controls whether or not the output data should be
*        multiplied by the ADC factor to convert the input ADUs to
*        counts (electrons). This option is disabled if no variances
*        are generated. Care should be taken when using this option
*        with a large ADC factor and data types of _WORD,_UWORD,_BYTE
*        or _UBYTE as the output data range may exceed that allowed
*        with these types. In this case the best option is to set
*        the PRESERVE parameter FALSE.
*
*        [Default is TRUE if input data is not an unsigned data type
*        otherwise FALSE.]
*     EXTENT(4) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The extent of the useful CCD area. This should be given in
*        pixel index values (see notes). The extent is restricted to
*        that of the CCD frame, so no padding of the data can occur. If
*        values outside of those permissable are given then they are
*        modified to lie within the CCD frame. The values should be
*        given in the order XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX.
*
*        Normally the extent should be set so that the bias strips
*        are excluded from the output data, this is essential for
*        flatfields whose normalisation could be adversely biased.
*
*        If global values for these bounds have been set using
*        CCDSETUP then those values will be used.
*     FIXORIGIN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether to fix the origins of the output NDFs to 1,1, rather 
*        than the lower corner as defined by the EXTENT parameter. 
*        This option is of particular use if the analysis package 
*        you are going to use does not support origins.
*        [FALSE]
*     FMODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The fit mode which will be used when interpolating bias values.
*        May take values of "LINE" or "PLANE". This is used together
*        with the SMODE parameter to define the interpolation method,
*        ie. FMODE="LINE", SMODE="LINEAR", fits each row or column of
*        the bias strips by a straight line; FMODE="PLANE",
*        SMODE="CONSTANT" derives a single constant for the bias value;
*        FMODE="PLANE", SMODE="LINEAR" fits a plane to the bias-strip
*        data.
*        [LINE]
*     GENVAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If variances are to be generated then this value is set
*        TRUE. If variances are not to be generated then this value
*        should be set FALSE. Normally variances should be generated,
*        even though disk and process time savings can be made by their
*        omission.
*
*        If a global value has been set up using CCDSETUP this value
*        will be used.
*        [FALSE]
*     GETBIAS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls whether or not an attempt is to be made
*        to access a master bias NDF.
*        [TRUE]
*     GETMASK = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls whether or not an attempt is to be made
*        to access a defect mask using the parameter MASK.
*        [TRUE]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of the names of the NDFs which contain the raw CCD
*        data. Note that at present the input data must have a common
*        processing mode, i.e. use the same bias frame, have the same
*        ADC factor, readout noise etc. These values are represented
*        by the parameter values of the task.
*
*        The NDF names should be separated by commas and may include
*        wildcards.
*     KEEPIN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether to keep (i.e. not delete) the input NDFs (parameter IN)
*        or not. Deleting the input NDFs has the advantage of saving
*        disk space, but should probably only be used if this program
*        is part of a sequence of commands and the intermediary data
*        produced by it are not important.
*
*        The calibration master frames (parameters BIAS and possibly MASK)
*        are never deleted.
*
*        The default for this parameter is TRUE and this cannot be
*        overridden except by assignment on the command line or in
*        response to a forced prompt.
*        [TRUE]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP,
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     MASK = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of an NDF or ASCII Regions Definition (ARD) file.
*
*        If an NDF is given then any regions of BAD values (set through
*        explicit BAD values or by BADBITS in the quality component)
*        will be transferred to the output NDF.
*
*        If an ARD file is given then its regions will be interpreted
*        and transferred to the output NDF. ARD is described in its own
*        section.
*
*        The regions whose quality is to be set are probably hot spots,
*        line defects etc.  which contain little or no useful
*        information. This parameters may be returned as ! indicating
*        that no mask is to be applied.
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using
*        CCDSETUP then this will be used.
*
*        The name of this file may be specified using indirection
*        through a file.
*        [!]
*     NSIGMA = _REAL (Read)
*        The number of standard deviations to clip the bias strips at.
*        This is only used in CMODE="SIGMA". The actual clipping
*        occurs at NSIGMA*RNOISE. If no variances are being generated
*        then the RNOISE value is estimated from the data values in
*        the strips.
*        [4.0]
*     OFFSET = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then the input bias data array is offset
*        by the mean value derived from the bias-strip areas. If FALSE
*        then the bias data is directly subtracted. This parameter is
*        disabled for unsigned data types as the bias data cannot have
*        been previously zeroed.
*        [TRUE]
*     OUT = LITERAL (Write)
*        Names of the output NDFs. These may be specified as list of
*        comma separated names, using indirection if required, OR,
*        as a single modification element (of the input names). The
*        simplest modification element is the asterisk "*" which means
*        call each of the output NDFs the same name as the
*        corresponding input NDFs. So,
*           IN > *
*           OUT > *
*        signifies that all the NDFs in the current directory should be
*        used and the output NDFs should have the same names. 
*
*        Other types of modification can also occur, such as,
*           OUT > tmp_*
*        which means call the output NDFs the same as the input NDFs but
*        put tmp_ in front of the names. Replacement of a specified
*        string with another in the output file names can also be used,
*           OUT > tmp_*|debias|flattened|
*        this replaces the string debias with flattened in any of the
*        output names tmp_*.
*     PRESERVE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then the data type of the input NDFs are used for
*        processing and are preserved on exit from this routine. If
*        FALSE then a suitable floating point type will be chosen for
*        the output type and the processing will be performed using
*        this choice.
*
*        This option should be used when a unacceptable loss of
*        accuracy may occur, or when the data range can no longer be
*        represented in the range of the present data type. The latter
*        effect may occur when expanding input ADU values into
*        electrons, if the ADC factor is large and the input data have
*        types of _WORD,_UWORD,_BYTE or _UBYTE.
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using
*        CCDSETUP then this will be used.
*        [TRUE]
*     RNOISE = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The readout noise in input data units (ADUs). An estimate of
*        the readout noise is shown for unweighted values in the bias
*        strips, if the bias strips are used. If variances are not
*        generated then this value is not used. If variances are
*        generated then the readout noise is included in the variance
*        estimates.
*
*        If a global value has been set using CCDSETUP then this will
*        be used.
*        [Dynamic default or 1.0]
*     SATURATE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls whether the data are to be processed to
*        detect saturated values or not. The actual saturation value is
*        given using the SATURATION parameter.
*        [FALSE]
*     SATURATION = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The data saturation value. Only used if SATURATE is TRUE.
*        [1.0D6]
*     SETBAD = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then the quality information will be transferred
*        from the MASK NDF to the output NDFs in the form of BAD
*        ("flagged") values in the data component. This is the usual
*        method of indicating the presence of pixels with no value. If
*        FALSE then the quality information will be transferred into
*        the quality component, all output quality pixels will have
*        their BADBITS set. (Note that if the input NDF already has a
*        quality component the BADBITS will be set by a logical OR of
*        the current bits with the BADBITS value).
*        [TRUE]
*     SETSAT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls how saturated data will be flagged.
*        If it is set TRUE then saturated values will be replaced by
*        the value of the parameter SATURATION (which is also the value
*        used to detect saturated data). If it is FALSE then saturated
*        values will be set to BAD (also known as invalid).
*        [FALSE]
*     SMODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The mode which will be used to perform any interpolation fit
*        between the bias strips. Can take values of "CONSTANT" or
*        "LINEAR". If only one bias strip is given this may only take
*        the value "CONSTANT". This is used together with the FMODE
*        parameter to define the interpolation method, i.e.
*        FMODE="LINE", SMODE="LINEAR", fits each row or column of the
*        bias strips by a straight line; FMODE="PLANE",
*        SMODE="CONSTANT" derives a single constant for the bias value;
*        FMODE="PLANE", SMODE="LINEAR" fits a plane to the bias-strip
*        data.
*        [CONSTANT]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output NDF.
*        [Output from DEBIAS]
*     USECON = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then you can supply an estimate for the bias
*        contribution (parameter ZERO). This value is then subtracted
*        from the input NDF. Only use this option if you do not have
*        any bias frames or bias strips and you have good reason to
*        believe that the value you are supplying is accurate enough
*        for your purposes.
*        [FALSE]
*     USEEXT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then certain of the parameters of this program will not
*        be used and the required values will be obtained from the
*        CCDPACK extensions of the input NDFs instead. This method can
*        only be used if the NDFs have been "imported" using the
*        programs PRESENT or IMPORT. Typically it is used when
*        processing using CCDPACK's "automated" methods (in this case
*        the input NDFs should contain all the information necessary to
*        process them).
*        
*        The parameters that this effects are:
*           ADC
*           BOUNDS
*           DEFERRED
*           DIRECTION
*           EXTENT
*           RNOISE
*           SATURATION
*           ZERO
*
*        Values obtained from the CCDPACK extension are identified in
*        the output log by the presence of a trailing asterisk (*).
*        [FALSE]
*     WMODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The weighting method which is to be used when deriving means
*        or performing the least squares interpolation fits using any
*        bias strips. Can take the values "LINEAR", "EXP", or "NONE".
*        "LINEAR" and "EXP"-onential produce weights which are maximum
*        in the centre of each bias strip and which fall off towards
*        the edges. "LINEAR" weighting gives zero weighting for the
*        edge lines and so is the more robust.
*        [LINEAR]
*     ZERO = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        If USECON=TRUE then this value is subtracted from the input
*        NDF.

*  Examples:
*     debias r1 r1b bias '[2,10,400,415]' adc=1.1 rnoise=8
*        This example debiasses the data array in NDF r1 writing the
*        result to NDF r1b. It uses the data component of NDF BIAS as
*        the bias estimator. The bias is offset by the mean value found
*        within the ranges 2-10 and 400-415 pixels along the X axis.
*        The data in the bias strips are smoothed by a box filter and
*        weighted linearly from the edges inwards. The output variance
*        is produced by a combination of the Poisson statistics (using
*        an ADC value of 1.1) and readout noise (value 8), together
*        with the variance of the bias NDF (if present).
*
*     debias in=r1 out=r2 bounds='[2,10,401,416]' adc=2.5 rnoise=10
*        This example debiasses the NDF r1 data component writing the
*        result to the NDF r2. The bias is estimated by an interpolation
*        of a constant for each data row. The constant is the result of
*        a linearly weighted average of the bias strip data which has
*        been box filtered.

*            fmode=plane direct=y wmode=exp cmode=sigma rnoise=10
*            nsigma=4
*        This example debiasses the NDF r1 data component writing the
*        result to the NDF r2. The bias is estimated by the fitting of a
*        plane to the data in the bias strips. The bias-strip data are
*        first sigma clipped at a level RNOISE*NSIGMA. The fit is
*        performed with weighting based on a exponential fall off
*        from the centre of the strips. The bias strips are defined by
*        the bounds applied up the Y axis.
*

*            bias=bias/master_bias
*        In this example all the NDFs in the current directory are
*        debiassed. The names of the output NDFs are as those of the
*        corresponding input NDFs, except that they are trailed by the
*        "_debias" string.

*      quality (either by setting the appropriate pixels BAD or by
*      setting part of the quality component) to be described within an
*      ordinary text file using the ARD (ASCII Region Definition)
*      language. The ARD language is based on a set of keywords that
*      identify simple shapes. Some of the regions which can be defined
*      are:
*
*         - BOX
*         - CIRCLE
*         - COLUMN
*         - ELLIPSE
*         - LINE
*         - PIXEL
*         - POLYGON
*         - RECT
*         - ROTBOX
*         - ROW
*
*      ARD descriptions can be created using the KAPPA application
*      ARDGEN, or you can of course create your own by hand. An example
*      of the contents of an ARD file follows.
*
*         #
*         # ARD description file for bad regions of my CCD.
*
*         COLUMN( 41, 177, 212 )        # Three bad columns
*         PIXEL( 201, 143, 153, 167 )   # Two Bad pixels
*         BOX( 188, 313, 5, 5 )         # One Hot spot centred at 188,313
*         ELLIPSE( 99, 120, 21.2, 5.4, 45.0 )
*
*         # Polygons defining badly vignetted corners
*         POLYGON( 2.2, 96.4, 12.1, 81.5, 26.9, 63.7, 47.7, 41.9,
*                  61.5, 24.1, 84.3, 0.0 , 0.0, 0.0 )
*         POLYGON( 6.2, 294.3, 27.9, 321.0, 52.6, 348.7, 74.4, 371.5,
*                  80.0, 384.0, 0.0, 384.0 )
*         #

*  Implementation Status:
*     - This task supports all components of an NDF. If requested
*       [default] a variance is produced from the bias subtracted
*       values. The task processes BAD pixels. The UNITS of the output
*       NDF are set to ADUs or electrons depending on whether data
*       expansion has occurred or not. Processing is supported for all
*       HDS (non-complex) numeric types.

*  Notes:
*     - If the input NDFs have variance components and no variances
*       are to be generated then they are processed.
*
*     - Pixel indices. The bounds supplied to DEBIAS should be given as
*       pixel indices. These usually start at 1,1 for the pixel at the
*       lower left-hand corner of the data-array component (this may
*       not be true if the NDFs have been sectioned, in which case the
*       lower left hand pixel will have pixel indices equal to the data
*       component origin values). Pixel indices are different from
*       pixel coordinates in that they are non-continuous, i.e. can
*       only have integer values, and start at 1,1 not 0,0. To change
*       from pixel coordinates add 0.5 and round to the nearest integer.

*  Behaviour of parameters:
*     Most parameters retain their current value as default. The
*     "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
*     application. If the application has not been run then the
*     "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
*     The exceptions to this rule are:
*        - TITLE   -- always "Output from DEBIAS"
*        - KEEPIN  -- always TRUE
*
*     Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
*     define the default behaviour of the application but does mean
*     that additional care needs to be taken when using the application
*     on new datasets/different devices, or after a break of sometime.
*     The intrinsic default behaviour of the application may be
*     restored by using the RESET keyword on the command line.
*
*     Certain parameters (ADC, BIAS, BOUNDS, DEFERRED, DIRECTION,
*     EXTENT, GENVAR, LOGFILE, LOGTO, MASK, PRESERVE, RNOISE, SATURATE,
*     SATURATION and SETSAT) have global values. These global values
*     will always take precedence, except when an assignment is made on
*     the command line.  In general global values may be set and reset
*     using the CCDSETUP and CCDCLEAR commands, however, the BIAS
*     parameter may only be set by a run of the application MAKEBIAS.
*
*     If the parameter USEEXT is TRUE then the following parameters
*     are not used: ADC, BOUNDS, DEFERRED, DIRECTION, EXTENT, RNOISE,
*     SATURATION and ZERO. Values are obtained from the input NDF
*     extensions instead.
