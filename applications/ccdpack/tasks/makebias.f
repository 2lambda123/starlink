      SUBROUTINE MAKEBIAS( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     MAKEBIAS

*  Purpose:
*     Produces a master from a set of bias frames.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MAKEBIAS( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine processes a series of bias frames (stored in NDFs),
*     so as to produce a single "master bias" frame in which the noise
*     levels are reduced. This master bias frame can then be used to
*     de-bias other CCD frames (using DEBIAS). Using the given readout
*     noise an, optional, variance component may be produced for the
*     output data. The use of a variance component allows the effects
*     of noise in bias subtraction to be properly monitored.
*
*     MAKEBIAS also performs other functions during processing, such as
*     estimating the readout noise (which it displays for comparison
*     with the nominal value), estimating the data levels, zeroing the
*     average value of the input data before combination (to more
*     closely follow any drifts in the zero level) and also supports
*     many different methods for performing the bias-frame data
*     combination. The combination methods offer a mixture of very
*     robust (median) to very efficient (mean) estimators.

*  Usage:
*     makebias in out rnoise method  { alpha=?
*                                    { sigmas=? niter=?
*                                    { niter=?
*                                    { min=? max=?

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ALPHA = _REAL (Read)
*        The fraction of extreme values to remove before combining
*        the data at any pixel. This fraction is removed from each
*        extreme so can only take a value in the range 0 to 0.5.
*        Only used if METHOD="TRIMMED"
*        [0.2]
*     GENVAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then a variance component representative of the
*        readout noise will be generated. If FALSE then no variance
*        component will be generated. If a variance component is not
*        generated then any future estimates of variance made using the
*        output NDF will be underestimates, however, disk space savings
*        can be made using this option, if future error analyses are
*        not important. If this parameter is set FALSE then a readout
*        noise estimate will not be requested.
*
*        If a global value has been set using CCDSETUP this value
*        will be used, and will be shown as the default.
*        [FALSE]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of NDF names which contain the raw bias frame data.
*        The NDF names should be separated by commas and may include wildcards.
*     KEEPIN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether to keep (i.e. not delete) the input NDFs or not.
*        Deleting the input NDFs has the advantage of saving disk
*        space, but since the NDFs input to this routine are raw data
*        files (rather than processed intermediary files) they should be
*        always be keep unless space considerations are at a very high
*        premium.
*
*        The default for this parameter is TRUE and this cannot be
*        overridden except by assignment on the command line or in
*        reponse to a forced prompt.
*        [TRUE]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     MAX = _REAL (Read)
*        If METHOD = "THRESH" then this value defines the upper limit
*        for values which can be used when combining data. Note that the
*        value used for this parameter will not be corrected for zero
*        pointing. Hence if the output NDF is to be zeroed then the
*        maximum value should be a offset from zero (say some positive
*        number 2 or 3 sigmas large). This could be used as a form of
*        sigma clipping if no variances are to be generated.
*     METHOD = LITERAL (Read)
*        The method to be used to combine the data components of
*        the input NDFs. This may be set to any unique abbreviation of
*        the following:
*           -  MEAN      -- Mean of the input data values
*           -  MEDIAN    -- Weighted median of the input data values
*           -  TRIMMED   -- An "alpha trimmed mean" in which a fraction
*                           alpha of the values are removed from
*                           each extreme
*           -  MODE      -- An iteratively "sigma clipped" mean which
*                           approximates to the modal value
*           -  SIGMA     -- A sigma clipped mean
*           -  THRESHOLD -- Mean with values above and below given
*                           limits removed
*           -  MINMAX    -- Mean with the highest and lowest values
*                           removed
*           -  BROADENED -- A broadened median (the mean of a small
*                           number of central values)
*           -  CLIPMED   -- A sigma clipped median (like SIGMA except
*                           that the median of the clipped values is used)
*           -  FASTMED   -- Unweighted median of the input data values
*        [MEDIAN]
*     MIN = _REAL (Read)
*        If METHOD = "THRESH" then this value defines the lower limit
*        for values which can be used when combining the data. Note that
*        the value used for this parameter will not be corrected for zero
*        pointing. Hence if the output NDF is to be zeroed then the
*        minimum value should be a offset from zero (say some negative
*        number 2 or 3 sigmas large). This could be used as a form of
*        sigma clipping if no variances are to be generated.
*     MINPIX = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The minimum number of good (i.e. not BAD) pixels required
*        to contribute to the value of an output pixel. Output pixels
*        not meeting this requirement are set BAD.
*        [1]
*     NITER = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of refining iterations performed if METHOD = "MODE".
*        [7]
*     OUT = LITERAL (Read)
*        Name of the output NDF. This has the master bias frame and
*        the estimated variances.  If USESET is true and multiple Sets
*        are represented in the IN list, then this name will be used
*        as the name of an HDS container file containing one NDF for
*        each Set Index value.  
*        This name may be specified using indirection through a file.
*     PRESERVE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then this indicates that the input data type is to be
*        used for processing. If not then the output type will either
*        be _REAL or _DOUBLE, the precision at which the combinations
*        are performed.
*
*        If a global value has been set using CCDSETUP then this will
*        be used.
*        [TRUE]
*     RNOISE = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The readout-noise standard deviation. This should be in the
*        input data units (ADUs). A value for this will be worked out
*        for each frame and reported at the end of the task. The
*        average of these values is reported immediately before this
*        parameter is accessed and can be used if a better estimate is
*        not known. Note that the supplied estimate has some resilience
*        to large-scale structure in the input frames, but will be
*        incorrect if the input-frame backgrounds are severely sloped.
*        If variances are not generated then this value will not be
*        accessed.
*
*        The value of this parameter may not be used if the USEEXT
*        parameter is TRUE and will not be used if GENVAR is FALSE
*        (i.e. no variances are being generated). If USEEXT is TRUE
*        then readout noise values will be extracted from the NDFs
*        CCDPACK extensions. Only if a suitable value is not present
*        will the value associated with this parameter be used.
*
*        If a global value has been set up using CCDSETUP this value
*        will be used, and will be shown as the default.  If USESET
*        is true, a global value specific to each image's Set Index
*        value will be sought.
*        [Dynamically derived value]
*     SIGMAS = _REAL (Read)
*        Number of standard deviations to reject data at. Used for
*        "MODE", "SIGMA" and "CLIPMED" methods. For METHOD = "MODE" the
*        standard deviation is estimated from the population of values. For
*        METHOD = "SIGMA" and "CLIPMED" this value is the readout noise.
*        [4]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output NDF
*        [Output from MAKEBIAS].
*     USEEXT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then the parameter RNOISE of this program will not
*        be used and the required values will be obtained from the
*        CCDPACK extensions of the input NDFs instead. This method can
*        only be used if the NDFs have been "imported" using the
*        programs PRESENT or IMPORT. Typically it is used when
*        processing using CCDPACK's "automated" methods.
*
*        Values obtained from the CCDPACK extension are identified in
*        the output log by the presence of a trailing asterisk (*).
*        [FALSE]
*     USESET = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether to use Set header information or not.  If USESET is
*        false then any Set header information will be ignored.
*
*        If USESET is true, then input files will be considered in
*        groups; a separate master bias frame will be constructed for
*        each group of corresponding input frames (i.e. those sharing
*        the same Set Index attribute).  If this results in multiple
*        output master bias frames, they will be written as separate
*        NDFs into a single HDS container file.  If no Set header
*        information is present in the input files, then all the
*        input files are combined together to form the master bias,
*        so USESET can usually be safely set to TRUE (the default).
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using 
*        CCDSETUP then that value will be used.
*        [TRUE]
*     ZERO = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Flag indicating whether the output master bias is to have a
*        mean value of zero or not. If TRUE the input data components
*        are ZERO-ed before combination, of the data. Note that if
*        this option is chosen then it will be necessary to offset the
*        master bias to the data before subtraction. This option is
*        not allowed for unsigned input data type (unless PRESERVE is
*        FALSE) as zeroing will make around half the data values
*        invalid.
*        [TRUE]

*  Examples:
*     makebias in='"b1,b2,b3,b4,b5"' method=median out=mbias rnoise=10
*        This forms a master bias from the data components of the NDFs
*        b1-b5. The combination mode chosen is the median. The output
*        NDF is mbias whose variance has values based on a readout
*        noise of 10 data units. Note the quotes when entering a comma
*        separated list on the command line.
*
*     makebias in=^bias_frames.lis out=master_bias
*        In this example the list of NDFs is read from the file
*        bias_frames.lis. This file may contain indirection to other files
*        up to a depth of 7.
*
*     makebias in='*' out=master_bias
*        In this example all the NDFs in the directory are used.

*  Implementation Status:
*     - The routine supports BAD pixels and all numeric data types
*       except COMPLEX.  All combinational arithmetic is performed using
*       floating values.  The UNITS, AXIS and TITLE components
*       are correctly propagated. Any input variances are ignored.

*  Notes:
*     - If a variance component is present it will not be propagated.

*  Behaviour of parameters:
*     Most parameters retain their current value as default. The
*     "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
*     application. If the application has not been run then the
*     "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
*     The exceptions to this rule are:
*        - RNOISE  -- dynamic value (but see below)
*        - TITLE   -- always "Output from MAKEBIAS"
*        - KEEPIN  -- always TRUE
*
*     Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
*     define the default behaviour of the application but does mean
*     that additional care needs to be taken when using the application
*     on new datasets/different devices, or after a break of sometime.
*     The intrinsic default behaviour of the application may be
*     restored by using the RESET keyword on the command line.
*
*     Certain parameters (LOGTO, LOGFILE, RNOISE, GENVAR, PRESERVE and
*     USESET) have global values. These global values will always take
*     precedence, except when an assignment is made on the command line.
*     Global values may be set and reset using the CCDSETUP and
*     CCDCLEAR commands.  If USESET is true then a global value
*     of RNOISE specific to the Set Index of each image will be used
*     if one is available.
*
*     The parameter RNOISE will not be used if the USEEXT parameter is
*     set TRUE. In this case values will be obtained from the input NDFs
*     CCDPACK extensions.
