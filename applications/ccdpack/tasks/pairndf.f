      SUBROUTINE PAIRNDF( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PAIRNDF

*  Purpose:
*     Aligns images graphically by drag and drop.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PAIRNDF( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine accepts a list of NDFs which may be aligned using
*     simple offsets in their Current coordinate frames.
*     By making use of a graphical user interface you
*     can indicate how pairs of images are aligned with respect
*     to each other, and mark image features to allow accurate
*     alignments.  Once enough pairings have been specified to register
*     all frames completely a global merger of all the positions
*     for each image takes place. This results in the output of one list
*     of uniquely labelled positions for each NDF. These position lists
*     can then be used in a routine such as REGISTER to produce the
*     actual transformation between the NDFs.
*
*     If NDFs have been grouped into Sets for alignment purposes by
*     using MAKESET, and the USESET parameter is true, then the
*     program will treat each Set of NDFs as a single image to be
*     aligned.
*
*     The graphical interface consists of two parts: a chooser which
*     allows you to nominate pairs of images to be aligned,
*     and an aligner which allows you to move the pair around the
*     screen until they are registered, and to mark points in the
*     overlapping region where the same centroidable features exist
*     on both images.
*
*     Operation is as follows.  You must first use the chooser window
*     to select a pair of images which have a region in common
*     (if you only have two images this step may be skipped).
*     Use the tabs at either side of the screen to pick the image to
*     appear on that side.  You can use the "Show FITS" button to
*     select one or more FITS headers to be displayed alongside
*     each image if this will make it easier to identify which is which.
*     You can use the "Display cutoff" menu to select the percentiles
*     controlling the brightness of each pixel; alignment is easier if
*     the same features are of a similar brightness in different images.
*     The images are displayed resampled into their Current coordinates,
*     so that their orientation will be the same as in the aligner.
*     You can only align them using this program if a simple offset
*     (translation) maps one onto another in these
*     coordinates (or very nearly does so).  If that is not the case,
*     you will have to set their Current coordinate system
*     to a different value (see WCSEDIT) or align them using a
*     different method.  The whole of each image will be displayed in
*     the chooser window; select a pair with
*     an overlapping region which you wish to align, and click the
*     "Use this pair" button.  The aligner window will then appear,
*     displaying the two images which you have selected.
*     The chooser window can normally be resized in the normal way to
*     make the images bigger or smaller.  However there is currently
*     a bug which causes this to crash in some window managers which
*     use continuous resizing.  In this case you must use the PREVX
*     and PREVY parameters to change the image size.
*
*     In the aligner window you can drag either of these images around
*     the display region by holding down mouse button 1 (usually the
*     left one) as you move the mouse; the easiest way to align the pair
*     is to "pick up" one image by an identifiable feature and "drop" it
*     on the same feature in the other image.  Where the images overlap
*     their pixels will be averaged.  If they are not correctly
*     positioned, you can move them again.  Once you are happy that
*     they are aligned about right, then click in the overlap region
*     to mark features which appear in both images.  During this
*     part you mark points by clicking with mouse button 1 (usually
*     the left one) and you can remove them by clicking with button 3
*     (usually the right one).
*
*     When you add a point by clicking it will be centroided on both
*     images, and two markers plotted, one for each centroided position.
*     If a centroidable object near that point cannot be identified
*     on both images the program will not allow you to mark a point
*     there.  However, note that the centroiding algorithm is
*     capable of locating spurious objects from noise, so the fact
*     that a point can be marked does not prove that a real
*     feature exists on both images.  By looking at the two markers
*     it should be possible to see whether a real feature has been
*     located.  Though the two markers do not need to be exactly
*     concentric (REGISTER can take care of that later), the offset
*     between them should be similar to that of other marked objects
*     nearby in the overlap region.  If you do not think the same
*     object has been identified in both images, you should remove
*     this point (with mouse button 3).
*
*     The aligner window can be resized, the magnification changed
*     using the "Zoom" control, the display region scrolled using
*     the scrollbars, and the shape and colour of the point markers
*     selected.  When you have aligned the images and marked shared
*     features, or if you decide that the pair cannot be satisfactorily
*     registered, click the "Done" button.
*
*     You will then be returned to the chooser window to select another
*     pair and repeat the process.  After the first time however,
*     you will only be allowed to select a pair of images to align
*     if at least one of them has already been aligned.  Those
*     which have already been done are marked with a `+' sign on their
*     selection tabs.
*
*     Once you have made enough pairings to register the whole set, the
*     graphical windows will disappear and the program will complete
*     the global matching up of positions without any further user
*     interaction.

*  Usage:
*     pairndf in outlist percentiles

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     CHOOSER = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If only two images are presented in the IN list, then this
*        parameter determines whether they should be previewed in
*        the chooser widget before they are presented for alignment.
*        With only two, the chooser is not normally necessary since
*        there is only one possible pair to select for alignment,
*        but if you want to equalise the image brightnesses using
*        the "Display cutoff" button or preview FITS headers you
*        may wish to respond true to this.
*        [FALSE]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of NDF names whose data are to be transformed. The NDF
*        names should be separated by commas and may include wildcards.
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     MARKSTYLE1 = LITERAL (Read and Write)
*        A string indicating how markers are initially to be plotted in
*        the aligner widget to represent points on the left hand image.
*        It consists of a comma-separated list of "attribute=value"
*        type strings.  The available attributes are:
*           - colour     -- Colour of the marker in Xwindows format.
*           - size       -- Approximate height of the marker in pixels.
*           - thickness  -- Approximate thickness of lines in pixels.
*           - shape      -- One of Plus, Cross, Circle, Square, Diamond.
*
*        This parameter only gives the initial marker type; it can be
*        changed interactively while the program is running.
*        If specifying this value on the command line, it is not
*        necessary to give values for all the attributes; missing ones
*        will be given sensible defaults.
*        ["shape=plus"]
*     MARKSTYLE2 = LITERAL (Read and Write)
*        A string indicating how markers are initially to be plotted in
*        the aligner widget to represent points on the right hand image.
*        It consists of a comma-separated list of "attribute=value"
*        type strings.  The available attributes are:
*           - colour     -- Colour of the marker in Xwindows format.
*           - size       -- Approximate height of the marker in pixels.
*           - thickness  -- Approximate thickness of lines in pixels.
*           - shape      -- One of Plus, Cross, Circle, Square, Diamond.
*
*        This parameter only gives the initial marker type; it can be
*        changed interactively while the program is running.
*        If specifying this value on the command line, it is not
*        necessary to give values for all the attributes; missing ones
*        will be given sensible defaults.
*        ["shape=circle"]
*     MAXCANV = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
*        A value in pixels for the maximum initial X or Y dimension of
*        the region in which the image is displayed.  Note this is the
*        scrolled region, and may be much bigger than the sizes given
*        by WINX and WINY, which limit the size of the window on the
*        X display.  It can be overridden during operation by zooming
*        in and out using the GUI controls, but it is intended to
*        limit the size for the case when ZOOM is large (perhaps
*        because the last image was quite small) and a large image
*        is going to be displayed, which otherwise might lead to
*        the program attempting to display an enormous viewing region.
*        If set to zero, then no limit is in effect.
*        [1280]
*     OVERRIDE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls whether to continue and create an
*        incomplete solution. Such solutions will result when only a
*        subset of the input position lists have been paired.
*
*        In this case, any NDFs for which matching was not
*        achieved will have their associated position lists removed
*        from their .MORE.CCDPACK extensions.  Thus after running
*        PAIRNDF with OVERRIDE set to TRUE, any position list associated
*        with an NDF is guaranteed to be one which has been matched, and
*        not just one left over from the previously associated unmatched
*        list.
*        [TRUE]
*     OUTLIST = LITERAL (Read)
*        An expression which is either a list of names or expands to a
*        list of names for the output position lists.
*
*        These may be specified as list of comma separated names,
*        using indirection if required, OR, as a single modification
*        element (of the input names). The simplest modification
*        element is the asterisk "*" which means call each of the
*        output lists the same name as the corresponding input NDFs (but
*        without the ".sdf" extension).
*        So,
*           IN > *
*           OUTLIST > *
*        signifies that all the NDFs in the current directory should be
*        used and the output lists should have the same names.
*
*        Other types of modification can also occur, such as,
*           OUTLIST > *_objs.dat
*        which means call the position lists the same as the input NDFs
*        but put "_objs.dat" after the names. Replacement of a specified
*        string with another in the output file names can also be used,
*           OUTLIST > *|_debias|_images.dat|
*        this replaces the string "_debias" with "_images.dat" in any
*        of the output names.
*
*        If wildcarded names for the input NDFs are used then it is
*        recommended that wildcards are also used for the position list
*        names as the correspondence between these may be confusing.
*        [*.DAT]
*     PERCENTILES( 2 ) = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The default low and high percentiles of the data range to use
*        when displaying the images; any pixels with a value lower than
*        the first element will have the same colour, and any with a
*        value higher than the second will have the same colour.  This
*        parameter gives the default value - the percentile settings
*        can be set for each image individually from within the GUI
*        to accomodate the situation where images have different
*        brightnesses.  Must be in the range 0 <= PERCENTILES( 1 )
*        <= PERCENTILES( 2 ) <= 100.
*        [2,98]
*     PREVX = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
*        The initial width in pixels of the preview display for each image;
*        two images will be displayed side by side at any one time at
*        this size in the chooser window.  This can be effectively changed
*        by resizing the entire chooser window in the normal way using
*        the window manager while the program is running.
*        [350]
*     PREVY = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
*        The initial height in pixels of the preview display for each image;
*        two images will be displayed side by side at any one time at
*        this size in the chooser window.  This can be effectively changed
*        by resizing the entire chooser window in the normal way using
*        the window manager while the program is running.
*        [350]
*     TOLER = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The tolerance for deduplicating centroided points (in pixels).
*        If two centroided objects on the same image are within this
*        distance of each other they will be identified as the same
*        object.  For a bright elliptical object, centroiding arising
*        from any nearby point will normally arrive at the same
*        position, so this can be set to a small value (<1), but
*        if the objects being identified cover many pixels and are close
*        to the background noise level it may be advantageous to set
*        it to a larger value so that centroids near to each other
*        are identified as referring to the same object.
*        [0.5]
*     USESET = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter determines whether Set header information should
*        be used or not.  If USESET is true,
*        PAIRNDF will try to group images according to their Set Name
*        attribute.  All NDFs which share the same (non-blank) Set
*        Name attribute, and which have a CCD_SET attached coordinate
*        system, will be grouped together and treated as a single
*        image for alignment.  In the graphical part of the program you
*        will view and position this group of images as a single item.
*
*        If the input NDFs have no Set headers, or if they have no
*        Set alignment coordinate system (one with a Domain of CCD_SET)
*        the setting of USESET will make no difference.
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using
*        CCDSETUP then that value will be used.
*        [FALSE]
*     WINX = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
*        The initial width in pixels of the aligner window, which contains
*        a space for dragging around a pair of images and associated
*        controls.  If the region required for the images is larger
*        than the area allocated for display, it can be scrolled
*        around within the window.  The window can be resized in the
*        normal way using the window manager while the program is running.
*        [800]
*     WINY = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
*        The initial height in pixels of the aligner window, which contains
*        space for dragging around a pair of images and associated
*        controls.  If the region required for the images is larger
*        than the area allocated for display, it can be scrolled
*        around within the window.  The window can be resized in the
*        normal way using the window manager while the program is running.
*        [400]
*     ZOOM = _DOUBLE (Read and Write)
*        A factor giving the initial level to zoom in to the images
*        displayed in the aligner window, that is the number of screen
*        pixels to use for one image pixel.  It will be rounded to one
*        of the values ... 3, 2, 1, 1/2, 1/3 ....  The zoom can be
*        changed interactively from within the program.  The initial
*        value may be limited by MAXCANV.
*        [1]

*  Examples:
*     pairndf * *.dat [1,99]
*        This example shows the positional nature of the parameters.
*        All the NDFs in the current directory are presented for
*        alignment.  Their output position lists have the same name
*        as the NDFs except that they have a file extension of .dat.
*        The default image display cutoff is between the 1st and 99th
*        percentile, which shows bright detail well.
*
*     pairndf in="data1,data2" outlist="d1-pos,d2-pos" zoom=2 maxcanv=0
*             markstyle1="shape=circle,size=8,thickness=1,colour=HotPink"
*        Only the two images data1 and data2 will be aligned, and the
*        corresponding sets of positions will be written to the
*        files d1-pos and d2-pos.  The images will initially be
*        displayed for alignment at a magnification of two screen
*        pixels to each data pixel, even if that results in a very
*        large display area.  During alignment, marked points on the
*        left hand image will be shown as little pink circles.

*  Implementation Status:
*     - Supports Bad pixel values and all non-complex data types.

*  Notes:
*     - NDF extension items.
*
*       On exit the CURRENT_LIST items in the CCDPACK extensions
*       (.MORE.CCDPACK) of the input NDFs are set to the names of the
*       appropriate output lists. These items will be used by other
*       CCDPACK position list processing routines to automatically
*       access the lists.
*
*     - Output position list format.
*
*       CCDPACK format - Position lists in CCDPACK are formatted files
*       whose first three columns are interpreted as the following.
*
*          - Column 1: an integer identifier
*          - Column 2: the X position
*          - Column 3: the Y position
*
*       The column one value must be an integer and is used to identify
*       positions which may have different locations but are to be
*       considered as the same point. Comments may be included in the
*       file using the characters # and !. Columns may be separated by
*       the use of commas or spaces.
*
*       In all cases, the coordinates in position lists are pixel
*       coordinates.

*  Behaviour of Parameters:
*     All parameters retain their current value as default. The
*     "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
*     application. If the application has not been run then the
*     "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
*
*     Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
*     define the default behaviour of the application.  The intrinsic
*     default behaviour of the application may be restored by using the
*     RESET keyword on the command line.
*
*     Certain parameters (LOGTO, LOGFILE and USESET) have global values.
*     These global values will always take precedence, except when an
*     assignment is made on the command line.  Global values may be set
*     and reset using the CCDSETUP and CCDCLEAR commands.
*
*     Some of the parameters (MARKSTYLE1, MARKSTYLE2, MAXCANV,
*     PERCENTILES, PREVX, PREVY, WINX, WINY)  give initial values for
*     quantities which can be modified while the program is running.
*     Although these may be specified on the command line, it is
*     normally easier to start the program up and modify them using
*     the graphical user interface.  If the program exits normally,
*     their values at the end of the run will be used as defaults
*     next time the program starts up.

*     11-FEB-2002 (MBT):
*        Modified call to CCD1_GMMP to fix an uninitialised array bug.
*     {enter_changes_here}

*  Bugs:
*     A few window managers which allow continuous active resizing of
*     windows may cause the program to crash when the chooser window is
*     being resized.  In this case, the PREVX and PREVY parameters
*     must be used to control the size of previewed images.
