      SUBROUTINE MAKECAL( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     MAKECAL

*  Purpose:
*     Produces a dark or pre-flash calibration NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL MAKECAL( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine performs the combination of a series of dark count
*     or pre-flash exposure frames. The input NDFs should have been
*     bias subtracted. The input data are divided by the exposure
*     factors before combination into a calibration "master", giving an
*     output NDF whose data represent one unit of the given exposure
*     time per pixel. Thus the calibration frame should be multiplied
*     by the appropriate factor before subtracting from other frames
*     (i.e. by the dark time or the flash-exposure time). This can be
*     performed by CALCOR and should be done prior to the production of
*     a flatfield and flatfield correction. The data combination methods
*     give a mixture of very robust (median) to very efficient (mean)
*     methods to suit the data.

*  Usage:
*     makecal in expose out method { alpha=?
*                                  { sigmas=? niter=?
*                                  { niter=?
*                                  { min=? max=?

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ALPHA = _REAL (Read)
*        The fraction of extreme values to remove before combining
*        the data at any pixel. This fraction is removed from each
*        extreme so can only take a value in the range 0 to 0.5.
*        Only used if METHOD="TRIMMED"
*        [0.2]
*     EXPOSE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Either:
*        An exact number of exposure factors for the input NDFs. The
*        values must be in the same order as the input NDFs.
*
*        Or:
*        A single value which applies to all the input NDFs.
*
*        Indirection through an ASCII file may be used to specify these
*        values. If more than one line is required at prompt time then
*        a continuation line may be requested by adding "-" to the end
*        of the line.
*
*        This parameter will not be used if USEEXT is set TRUE.
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of NDF names which contain the calibration data. The
*        NDF names should be separated by commas and may include
*        wildcards.
*
*        NOTE the use of wildcards with this program is not recommended
*        unless the input NDFs all have the same calibration exposure
*        factors. The order of processing of any wildcarded NDFs cannot
*        be guaranteed.
*     KEEPIN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether to keep (i.e. not delete) the input NDFs or
*        not. Deleting the input NDFs has the advantage of saving disk
*        space, but should probably only be used if this program is part
*        of a sequence of commands and the intermediary data used by
*        it are not important.
*
*        The default for this parameter is TRUE and this cannot be
*        overridden except by assignment on the command line or in
*        reponse to a forced prompt.
*        [TRUE]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     MAX = _REAL (Read)
*        If METHOD = "THRESH" then this value defines the upper limit
*        for values which can be used when combining the data. This
*        limit applies to the range of the output data (i.e. the values
*        after the exposure factors have been divided into the input
*        data).
*     METHOD = LITERAL (Read)
*        The method to be used to combine the data components of
*        the input NDFs. This may be set to any unique abbreviation of
*        the following:
*           -  MEAN      -- Mean of the input data values
*           -  MEDIAN    -- Weighted median of the input data values
*           -  TRIMMED   -- An "alpha trimmed mean" in which a fraction
*                           alpha/2 of the values are removed from
*                           each extreme
*           -  MODE      -- An iteratively "sigma clipped" mean which
*                           approximates to the modal value
*           -  SIGMA     -- A sigma clipped mean
*           -  THRESHOLD -- Mean with values above and below given
*                           limits removed
*           -  MINMAX    -- Mean with the highest and lowest values
*                           removed
*           -  BROADENED -- A broadened median (the mean of a small
*                           number of central values)
*           -  CLIPMED   -- A sigma clipped median (like SIGMA except
*                           that the median of the clipped values is used)
*           -  FASTMED   -- Unweighted median of input data values
*        [MEDIAN]
*     MIN = _REAL (Read)
*        If METHOD = "THRESH" then this value defines the lower limit
*        for values which can be used when combining the data. This
*        limit applies to the range of the output data (i.e. the values
*        after the exposure factors have been divided into the input
*        data).
*     MINPIX = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The minimum number of good (ie. not BAD) pixels required
*        to contribute to the value of an output pixel. Output pixels
*        not meeting this requirement are set BAD.
*        [1]
*     NITER = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of refining iterations performed if METHOD = "MODE".
*        [7]
*     OUT = LITERAL (Write)
*        Name of the output NDF to contain the calibration data.
*        Note this NDF will have a type of at least _REAL.
*        If USESET is true and multiple Sets are represented in the IN
*        list then this name will be used as the name of an HDS
*        container file containing one NDF for each Set Index value.
*        This name may be specified using indirection through a file.
*     SIGMAS = _REAL (Read)
*        Number of standard deviations to reject data at. Used for
*        "MODE", "SIGMA" and "CLIPMED" methods. For METHOD = "MODE" the
*        standard deviation is estimated from the population of values,
*        for METHOD = "SIGMA" the variances are used. If no variances
*        exist then a population estimate is used.
*        [4.0]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output NDF.
*        [Output from MAKECAL]
*     USESET = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether to use Set header information or not.  If USESET is
*        false then any Set header information will be ignored.
*        If USESET is true, then input files will be considered in
*        groups; a separate calibration frame will be constructed 
*        for each group of corresponding input frames (i.e. those
*        sharing the same Set Index attribute).  If this results in 
*        multiple output calibration files, they will be written as 
*        separate NDFs into a single HDS container file.
*        If no Set header information is present in the input files, 
*        then calibration is done on all the input files together,
*        so USESET can usually be safely set to TRUE (the default).
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using 
*        CCDSETUP then that value will be used.
*        [TRUE]
*     TYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The frame types of the input data. This should be a recognised
*        name "FLASH", "DARK" or "NONE". The value of this parameter
*        affects the output NDF frame type which will be set to
*        "MASTER_FLASH" or "MASTER_DARK" or "MASTER_?".
*        [NONE]
*     USEEXT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then the EXPOSE parameter of this program will not
*        be used and the required values will be obtained from the
*        CCDPACK extensions of the input NDFs instead. This method can
*        only be used if the NDFs have been "imported" using the
*        programs PRESENT or IMPORT. Typically it is used when
*        processing using CCDPACK's "automated" methods.
*
*        Values obtained from the CCDPACK extension are identified in
*        the output log by the presence of a trailing asterisk (*).
*        [FALSE]

*  Examples:
*     makecal in='"f1,f2,f3,f4"' expose='"100,200,300,400"' method=median
*             out=master_flash
*        This example forms a flash calibration NDF from the data in
*        NDFs f1,f2,f3 and f4. The data are divided by the relative
*        exposure factors before combination. The combination method
*        used is the (weighted) median, the resultant data are written
*        to the NDF master_flash.
*
*     makecal '"d1,d2,d3,d4"' 1 master_dark trimmed alpha=0.2
*        This example produces a dark-count-calibration frame from the
*        data in NDFs d1,d2,d3 and d4. The exposure factors are given
*        as 1 which probably indicates that the dark-exposure times in
*        these datasets are exactly right to correct any subsequent
*        data frames. The combination mode used is the trimmed mean with
*        trimming fraction 0.2 and the output data are written to NDF
*        master_dark.
*
*     makecal ^flash_frames ^flash_exposures flash_master
*        In this example a list of frames to be processed is passed to
*        the program by indirection through an ASCII file
*        flash_frames.dat, the corresponding exposure times are passed
*        from the file flash_exposures.dat. This is probably the only
*        safe method for entering NDFs to this routine other than as in
*        the above examples. Using wildcards for the file
*        specifications will mean that the exposures cannot be
*        associated correctly. Thus wildcards should not be used except
*        when the input NDFs have the same exposure times.

*  Implementation Status:
*     - The routine supports BAD pixels and all data types except
*       COMPLEX. All combinational arithmetic is performed in floating
*       point. The AXIS and TITLE components are correctly propagated.
*       The variances are propagated through the combination
*       processing, assuming that the input data have a normal
*       distribution.

*  Behaviour of parameters:
*     Most parameters retain their current value as default. The
*     "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
*     application. If the application has not been run then the
*     "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
*     The exceptions to this rule are:
*        - TITLE  -- always "Output from MAKECAL"
*        - KEEPIN -- always TRUE
*
*     Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
*     define the default behaviour of the application but does mean
*     that additional care needs to be taken when using the application
*     on new datasets/different devices, or after a break of sometime.
*     The intrinsic default behaviour of the application may be
*     restored by using the RESET keyword on the command line.
*
*     Certain parameters (LOGTO, LOGFILE and USESET) have global values. 
*     These global values will always take precedence, except when an
*     assignment is made on the command line.  Global values may be set
*     and reset using the CCDSETUP and CCDCLEAR commands.
*
*     The parameter EXPOSE will not be used if the USEEXT parameter is
*     set TRUE. In this case the necessary values will be extracted from
*     the CCDPACK extensions of the input NDFs.
