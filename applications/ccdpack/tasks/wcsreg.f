      SUBROUTINE WCSREG( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     WCSREG

*  Purpose:
*     Aligns NDFs using multiple coordinate systems.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL WCSREG( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application takes a set of NDFs which have World Coordinate
*     System (WCS) components, and tries to align them all according
*     to a given list of coordinate system domains (labels).  If
*     successful, it adds a new coordinate frame to the WCS component
*     of each within which they are all aligned.  The TRANLIST or
*     TRANNDF applications can then be used on the resulting NDFs.
*
*     This can be of use when different kinds of alignment information
*     are available between different members of a group of NDFs.  By
*     supplying an ordered list of coordinate systems within which to
*     align, the best alignment available can be made between
*     different  members of the group, falling back on second or third
*     choices of alignment types where first choices are not
*     available.
*
*     The application operates on a set of NDFs, IN.  A list of 
*     domains DOMAINS within which to align, in order of preference,
*     is specified, and a reference NDF is denoted by REFPOS.  On
*     successful completion, a new coordinate frame (which becomes
*     Current), with a domain given by OUTDOMAIN (default CCD_WCSREG)
*     is added to each of the NDFs in the input set.  Any previously
*     existing frames with this domain will be removed.
*
*     The new coordinate system is a copy of the pixel coordinate
*     system of the reference NDF, so for the reference NDF there is
*     a unit mapping between its pixel and new Current coordinates.
*     For each other NDF, the program attempts to find a mapping from
*     the reference NDF to it.  If it and the reference NDF do not
*     share frames in any of the domains given by the DOMAINS
*     parameter, it will try to use the WCS components of intermediate
*     NDFs to find a path between them; this path is a subgraph of a
*     graph in which the nodes are the NDFs and an edge exists between
*     two nodes if the NDFs share a domain in the given list.  The
*     shortest available path which connects a pair is chosen, and if
*     there is more than one which meets this criterion, one which
*     uses domains near the head of the list is preferred.
*
*     If the USESET parameter is true, then WCSREG will take account
*     of alignment information stored in the CCDPACK Set header;
*     this means that the alignment implied when images were 
*     previously grouped into a Set can be guaranteed to be retained.
*
*     If the graph is not fully connected, a list of the existing
*     subgraphs is output, and the program will normally terminate,
*     however it can be made to continue with registration of the 
*     connected NDFs by setting the OVERRIDE parameter.

*  Usage:
*     WCSREG in domains

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DOMAINS( * ) = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter should be a list of frame domains, in order 
*        of preference for achieving alignment.  Alignment paths 
*        between NDFs are selected by shortness of path, but in case
*        of a tie, those using domains nearest the start of this list
*        are used by preference.  You should not normally include the
*        CCD_SET domain in this list; for details of how this domain
*        is treated specially, see the USESET parameter.
*
*        Note that this parameter is an array of strings, so that either
*        the whole list should be surrounded by square brackets, or
*        each element should be surrounded by double quotes.  The
*        whole thing may need to be protected from the Unix shell
*        by using, e.g., single quotes.
*
*        Supplying the null value (!) is equivalent to specifying the
*        current domain of the reference NDF.  The effect of this
*        is to retain the alignment already given by the Current
*        coordinates of each image, but to ensure that the pixels
*        are aligned with the pixels of the reference image.
*        This will result in the images being aligned in a coordinate
*        system suitable for resampling with TRANNDF.
*        [!]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of the names of the NDFs which are to be aligned.  The
*        names should be separated by commas and may include wildcards.
*        They may alternatively be specified using an indirection file
*        (the indirection character is "^").
*
*        If the program is successful, a new coordinate system with a
*        domain determined by the OUTDOMAIN parameter will be added to
*        the WCS component of each of the IN files containing the
*        alignment information.  These will become the new Current
*        coordinates.
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     NAMELIST = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of an output file in which to record all the images
*        to which new coordinate systems were successfully added.
*        This may not be the same as the IN list if OVERRIDE is set
*        true.
*        [wcsreg.lis]
*     OUTDOMAIN = LITERAL (Read)
*        This gives the name of the domain for the new frame which is
*        added to the WCS components of the NDFs on successful 
*        completion.  If any frames in the same domain previously exist
*        in the WCS component, they are removed.  The name is converted
*        to upper case, and whitespace is removed.
*        [CCD_WCSREG]
*     OVERRIDE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If not all the NDFs can be aligned using the domains given in
*        DOMAINS then the application will report on which sets of NDFs
*        form connectable subsets of the IN list.  In this case, if this
*        parameter is set FALSE, then the application will exit with an
*        error message.  If it is set TRUE however, it will continue and
*        insert new frames in those NDFs which can be reached from the 
*        one indicated by REFPOS, making no change to the others, except
*        to remove any frames in the domain OUTDOMAIN which already exist.
*
*        The NAMELIST parameter can be used to record which images were
*        successfully registered when OVERRIDE is true (if OVERRIDE is
*        false, then it will be the same as IN unless the program fails).
*        [FALSE]
*     REFPOS = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The position within the IN list which corresponds to the 
*        reference NDF.  The registration frame is a copy of (and 
*        unitmapped to) the pixel frame of the reference NDF,
*        and for each other NDF the program tries to find a path from
*        it to the reference NDF going from one NDF to another only
*        when they both have frames in the same one of the entries in
*        the DOMAINS list. 
*        [1]
*     USESET = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter governs whether Set-based alignment 
*        information in the NDFs, if it exists, should be used. 
*        If it is set to true, then coordinate frames with the 
*        domain CCD_SET will take precedence over all the ones named 
*        in the DOMAINS parameter.  In this case, if two of the NDFs
*        both have a CCD_SET coordinate frame and also share the
*        same Set Name attribute, the connection will be made in
*        CCD_SET frame.  If no CCD_SET frames are present, this
*        parameter has no effect.
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using 
*        CCDSETUP then that value will be used.
*        [FALSE]

*  Examples:
*     wcsreg * [ccd_reg,sky]
*        In this example all the NDFs in the current directory are
*        being aligned.  All have an attached SKY coordinate sysetm
*        with approximate information about the pointing, added by the
*        telescope system at observation time.  Some of the NDFs
*        however overlap, and have been run through the REGISTER
*        program which has added a CCD_REG coordinate system
*        containing more accurate alignment information derived from
*        matching objects between different images.  Where two of the
*        images have CCD_REG coordinates, these will be used to align
*        them, but where they do not, the program will fall back on
*        the less accurate SKY coordinates for alignment.  The new
*        coordinate frame added will be given the default name
*        CCD_WCSREG.
*
*        After this process, the NDFs can be presented to TRANNDF for
*        resampling prior to making a mosaic.
*
*     wcsreg "obs1_*,obs2_*" outdomain=final 
*            domains=[ccd_reg,inst_obs1,inst_obs2]
*        NDFs with names starting 'obs1_' and 'obs2_' are aligned.
*        Where they share CCD_REG coordinates this will be used for
*        alignment, but otherwise the INST_OBS1 and INST_OBS2
*        coordinate systems will be used.  These perhaps contain
*        information about the relative alignment of CCDs on the focal
*        plane of the instrument, and may have been added to the WCS
*        component using the ASTIMP application.  The name FINAL is
*        used for the new domain added to the WCS component.
*    
*     wcsreg "skyfr1,skyfr2,skyfr3,skyfr4" refpos=2 domains=!
*        Here wcsreg is being used with a somewhat different intent.
*        The images named are already fully aligned in their 
*        current coordinates but executing this command has the effect of
*        aligning them in a new coordinate system which is a copy of
*        the pixel coordinate system of 'skyfr2'.  Since this has
*        units which are the size of pixels, the resulting image files
*        are suitable for resampling using TRANNDF.  Supposing that
*        they were originally aligned in SKY coordinates they could
*        not have been resampled by TRANNDF in their initial state,
*        since the SKY coordinates have units of radians, which 
*        are much too large compared to pixels.

*  Behaviour of parameters:
*     Most parameters retain their current value as default. The
*     "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
*     application. If the application has not been run then the
*     "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
*
*     Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
*     define the default behaviour of the application but does mean
*     that additional care needs to be taken when using the application
*     on new datasets or after a break of sometime.  The intrinsic
*     default behaviour of the application may be restored by using the
*     RESET keyword on the command line.
*
*     Certain parameters (LOGTO, LOGFILE and USESET) have global values.
*     These global values will always take precedence, except when an
*     assignment is made on the command line.  Global values may be set
*     and reset using the CCDSETUP and CCDCLEAR commands.
