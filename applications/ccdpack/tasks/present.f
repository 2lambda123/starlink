      SUBROUTINE PRESENT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PRESENT

*  Purpose:
*     Presents a list of NDFs to CCDPACK.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PRESENT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine enters reduction information into the CCDPACK
*     extensions of a list of NDFs. This information is required if an
*     automated reduction schedule is to be produced using SCHEDULE.
*     Before using this routine you should set up the CCDPACK global
*     parameters, describing the CCD characteristics, using the CCDSETUP
*     application.
*
*     If the input NDFs have not already been categorised then this
*     routine performs this task for the "frame types" BIAS, TARGET,
*     DARK, FLASH, FLAT, MASTER_BIAS, MASTER_FLAT, MASTER_DARK and
*     MASTER_FLASH (these are input as different groups of NDFs).
*
*     Missing exposure times for DARK and FLASH counts can be entered
*     as can filter types.
*
*     This routine can also be used to check that a list of NDFs have
*     the minimum amount of information in their CCDPACK extensions to
*     allow an automated scheduling.

*  Usage:
*     present modify=? simple=? in=? bias=? target=? dark=? flash=?
*             flat=? ftype=? filter=? darktime=? flashtime=?

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ADC = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The Analogue-to-Digital conversion factor. CCD readout values
*        are usually given in Analogue-to-Digital Units (ADUs). The ADC
*        factor is the value which converts ADUs back to the number of
*        electrons which were present in each pixel in the CCD after
*        the integration had finished. This value is required to allow
*        proper estimates of the inherent noise associated with each
*        readout value. CCDPACK makes these estimates and stores them
*        in the variance component of the final NDFs. Not supplying a
*        value for this parameter (if prompted) may be a valid response
*        if variances are not to be generated.
*
*        This parameter normally accesses the value of the related
*        CCDPACK global association. This behaviour can only be
*        superceded if ADC=value is used on the command-line
*        or if a prompt is forced (using using the PROMPT keyword). The
*        value of this parameter will be entered into the extension of
*        the input NDFs only if MODIFY is TRUE or the related extension
*        item does not exist.
*        [!]
*     ADDDARK = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether or not to prompt for a dark exposure time for the input
*        NDFs which require one.
*        [Dynamic default, TRUE if dark count frames are given, FALSE
*        otherwise]
*     ADDFLASH = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether or not to prompt for a pre-flash exposure time for the
*        input NDFs which require one.
*        [Dynamic default, TRUE if pre-flash frames are given, FALSE
*        otherwise]
*     BIAS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of the names of the NDFs which contain the raw bias
*        data. These are the NDFs which are to used to produce a
*        "master" bias NDF. On exit these NDFs will have their FTYPE
*        extension item set to the value "BIAS".
*        [!]
*     BIASVALUE = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        If no raw bias frames exist and the data does not have any bias
*        strips, then the only way to remove the bias contribution is
*        to subtract a constant. If your data has already had its bias
*        contribution subtracted and you want to process it using
*        CCDPACK (so that you can generate variances for instance) then
*        set this value to zero. This parameter defaults to ! and is not
*        prompted for so the only way that a value can be supplied is on
*        the command-line or by using the PROMPT keyword.
*        [!]
*     BOUNDS( 2 or 4 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The bounds of the detector bias strips (if any exist). The
*        bounds (if given) should be in pixel indices and be given in
*        pairs up to a limit of 2. The sense of the bounds is along the
*        readout direction.  For example, 2,16,400,416 means that the
*        bias strips are located between pixels 2 to 16 and 400 to 416
*        inclusive along the readout direction. The bias strips are
*        used to either offset the master bias NDF or as an estimate of
*        the bias which is to be interpolated across the NDF in some
*        way (see DEBIAS). Not supplying values for this parameter may
*        be a valid response if the bias frame is to be directly
*        subtracted from the data without offsetting or if a single
*        constant is to be used as the bias value for the whole NDF.
*
*        This parameter normally accesses the value of the related
*        CCDPACK global association. This behaviour can only be
*        superceded if BOUNDS=[value,...] is used on the command-line
*        or if a prompt is forced (using using the PROMPT keyword). The
*        value of this parameter will be entered into the extension of
*        the input NDFs only if MODIFY is TRUE or the related extension
*        item does not exist.
*        [!]
*     DARK = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of the names of the NDFs which contain the raw dark
*        count data. These are the NDFs which are to used to produce a
*        "master" dark counts NDF. On exit these NDFs will have their
*        FTYPE extension item set to the value "DARK".
*        [!]
*     DARKTIME = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The time for which the data in the current NDF collected dark
*        count electrons. The dark count is basically charge which
*        accumulates in the detector pixels due to thermal noise. The
*        effect of dark current is to produce an additive quantity to
*        the electron count in each pixel. Most modern devices only
*        produce a few ADU (or less) counts per pixel per hour and so
*        this effect can generally be ignored. This, however, is not
*        the case for Infra-Red detectors.
*
*        The value given does not need to be a number of seconds or
*        minutes and can be ratio of some kind, as long as it is
*        consistently used for all NDFs (so if all your NDFs have the
*        same darktime then the value 1 could be used). NDFs which have
*        no dark count should be given a DARKTIME of 0. This parameter
*        is only used if ADDDARK is TRUE.
*        [!]
*     DEFERRED = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The deferred charge value. Often known as the "fat" or "skinny"
*        zero (just for confusion). This is actually the charge which is
*        not transferred from a CCD pixel when the device is read out.
*        Usually this is zero or negligible and is only included for
*        completeness and for processing very old data.
*
*        This parameter normally accesses the value of the related
*        CCDPACK global association. This behaviour can only be
*        superceded if DEFERRED=value is used on the command-line
*        or if a prompt is forced (using using the PROMPT keyword). The
*        value of this parameter will be entered into the extension of
*        the input NDFs only if MODIFY is TRUE or the related extension
*        item does not exist.
*        [!]
*     DIRECTION = LITERAL (Read)
*        The readout direction of the detector. This may take the values
*        X or Y.  A value of X indicates that the readout direction is
*        along the first (horizontal) direction, an Y indicates that
*        the readout direction is along the direction perpendicular to
*        the X axis.
*
*        This parameter normally accesses the value of the related
*        CCDPACK global association. This behaviour can only be
*        superceded if DIRECTION=value is used on the command-line
*        or if a prompt is forced (using using the PROMPT keyword). The
*        value of this parameter will be entered into the extension of
*        the input NDFs only if MODIFY is TRUE or the related extension
*        item does not exist.
*        [!]
*     EXTENT( 4 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The extent of the useful detector area in pixel indices.  The
*        extent is defined as a range in X values and a range in Y
*        values (XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX). These define a section of an NDF
*        (see SUN/33). Any parts of the detector surface area outside
*        of this region will not be present in the final output. This is
*        useful for excluding bias strips, badly vignetted parts etc.
*
*        This parameter normally accesses the value of the related
*        CCDPACK global association. This behaviour can only be
*        superceded if EXTENT=[XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX] is used on the
*        command-line or if a prompt is forced (using using the PROMPT
*        keyword). The value of this parameter will be entered into the
*        extension of the input NDFs only if MODIFY is TRUE or the
*        related extension item does not exist.
*        [!]
*     FILTER = LITERAL (Read)
*        The filter name associated with the current NDF. The filter
*        name is stored in the extension item FILTER and is used when
*        determining which flatfields should be used for which data.
*        NDFs with a frame type which is independent of the filter will
*        not use this parameter. The filter type is a case sensitive
*        string.
*        [Current value]
*     FLASH = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of the names of the NDFs which contain the raw
*        pre-flash correction data. These are the NDFs which are to
*        used to produce a "master" pre-flash correction NDF. On exit
*        these NDFs will have their FTYPE extension item set to the
*        value "FLASH".
*        [!]
*     FLASHTIME  = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The time for which the data in the current NDF was exposed to
*        pre-flash.
*
*        The value given does not need to be a number of seconds or
*        minutes and can be ratio of some kind, as long as it is
*        consistently used for all NDFs (so if all your NDFs have the
*        same darktime then the value 1 could be used). NDFs which have
*        no pre-flash should be given a FLASHTIME of 0. This parameter
*        is only used if ADDFLASH is TRUE.
*        [!]
*     FLAT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of the names of the NDFs which contain the raw
*        flatfield data. These are the NDFs which are to used to
*        produce "master" flatfields (one for each filter type). On
*        exit these NDFs will have their FTYPE extension item set to
*        the value "FLAT".
*        [!]
*     FTYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The "frame" type of the current NDF. Each NDF is processed in
*        turn and if SIMPLE is TRUE and a frame type extension item does
*        not exist then this parameter will be used to prompt for a
*        value. A prompt will also be made if SIMPLE is TRUE and MODIFY
*        is TRUE regardless of whether the item already exists or not.
*        If SIMPLE is FALSE then this parameter will not be used.
*        [Current value]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of the names of the NDFs which contain the raw CCD
*        data. NDFs entered using this parameter must already have the
*        correct "frame type" information (extension item FTYPE)
*        entered into their CCDPACK extensions. This parameter is only
*        used if SIMPLE is TRUE.
*
*        The NDF names should be separated by commas and may include
*        wildcards.
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP,
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     MASTERBIAS = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of a master bias frame. If this has been created by
*        CCDPACK then there is no need to present it.  This parameter is
*        designed for the import of frames created by other packages.
*        [!]
*     MASTERDARK = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of a master dark counts frame. If this has been
*        created by CCDPACK then there is no need to present it (unless
*        for some reason it has been assigned the wrong frame type).
*        This parameter is designed for the import of frames created
*        by other packages.
*     MASTERFLASH = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of a master pre-flash frame. If this has been
*        created by CCDPACK then there is no need to present it (unless
*        for some reason it has been assigned the wrong frame type).
*        This parameter is designed for the import of frames created
*        by other packages.
*        [!]
*     MASTERFLAT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The names of a set of master flatfield frames (one for each
*        filter type used). If these have been created by CCDPACK then
*        there is no need to present them (unless for some reason they
*        have been assigned the wrong frame type or filter).  This
*        parameter is designed for the import of frames created by other
*        packages (such as those that specifically process spectral
*        data).
*        [!]
*     MASTERS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If this parameter is TRUE then prompts will be made for all the
*        master calibration types (MASTERBIAS, MASTERDARK, MASTERFLAT
*        and MASTERFLASH).
*        [FALSE]
*     MODIFY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If the input NDFs already contain information in their CCDPACK
*        extensions, then this parameter controls whether this
*        information will be overwritten (if a new value exists) or
*        not.
*        [TRUE]
*     MULTIENTRY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether or not the names of the input NDFs, their frame types,
*        filters and related exposure factors are all given in response
*        to the IN parameter (SIMPLE must be TRUE). If this option is
*        selected then the parameters FTYPE, FILTER, DARKTIME and
*        FLASHTIME will be set up with these values as defaults. If
*        MODIFY is TRUE then you will be given an opportunity to modify
*        them, otherwise these values will be entered into the NDF
*        CCDPACK extensions.
*
*        The input record format is five fields separated by commas. These
*        are:
*
*            - 1 NDF name
*            - 2 Frame type
*            - 3 Filter name
*            - 4 Dark exposure time
*            - 5 Flash exposure time
*
*        The latter three fields can be specified as "!" in which case
*        they are not set (they may not be relevant). Multiple records
*        can be entered and can be read in from a text file. So for
*        instance if the file "XREDUCE.NDFS" had the following as its
*        contents:
*
*           DATA1,target,!,!,!
*           DATA2,target,!,!,!
*           DATA3,target,!,!,!
*           FF1,flat,!,!,!
*           FF2,flat,!,!,!
*           FF3,flat,!,!,!
*           BIAS1,bias,!,!,!
*           BIAS2,bias,!,!,!
*           BIAS3,bias,!,!,!
*
*        Then it would be invoked using parameters
*
*           - SIMPLE MULTIENTRY IN=^XREDUCE.NDFS
*
*        This parameter is intended as an aid when using this program
*        non-interactively (i.e. from scripts) and shouldn't normally be
*        used, hence its default is FALSE and this can only be
*        overridden by assignment on the command line or in response to
*        a forced prompt.
*        [FALSE]
*     NAMELIST = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of a file to contain a listing of the name of the
*        input NDFs. This is intended to be of use when using these
*        same names with other applications (such as SCHEDULE).
*        [!]
*     ONEDARKTIME = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If the input data have the same dark count exposure time then
*        this parameter may be set to inhibit repeated prompting for an
*        exposure for every frame. This parameter is of particular use
*        when running from scripts.
*        [FALSE]
*     ONEFILTER = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If the input data have only one filter type then this parameter
*        may be set to inhibit repeated prompting for a filter name
*        for every frame (that is filter dependent). This parameter
*        is of particular use when running from scripts.
*        [FALSE]
*     ONEFLASHTIME = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If the input data have the same pre-flash exposure time then
*        this parameter may be set to inhibit repeated prompting for an
*        exposure for every frame. This parameter is of particular use
*        when running from scripts.
*        [FALSE]
*     RNOISE = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The readout noise of the detector (in ADUs). Usually the
*        readout noise of a detector is estimated by the observatory at
*        which the data was taken and this is the value which should be
*        supplied. Not supplying a value for this parameter may be a
*        valid response if variances are not to be generated.
*
*        This parameter normally accesses the value of the related
*        CCDPACK global association (which is the readout noise value).
*        This behaviour can only be superceded if RNOISE=value is used
*        on the command-line or if a prompt is forced (using using the
*        PROMPT keyword). The value of this parameter will be entered
*        into the extension of the input NDFs only if MODIFY is TRUE or
*        the related extension item does not exist.
*        [!]
*     SATURATION = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The saturation value of the detector pixels (in ADUs).
*
*        This parameter normally accesses the value of the related
*        CCDPACK global association. This behaviour can only be
*        superceded if SATURATION=value is used on the command-line
*        or if a prompt is forced (using using the PROMPT keyword). The
*        value of this parameter will be entered into the extension of
*        the input NDFs only if MODIFY is TRUE or the related extension
*        item does not exist.
*        [!]
*     SIMPLE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether or not the input NDFs already contain "frame type"
*        (extension item FTYPE) information in their CCDPACK extensions
*        or not. Usually NDFs to be presented to CCDPACK do not contain
*        this information, unless it has been imported from FITS
*        information using IMPORT, or the NDFs have already been
*        presented and this pass is to modify existing extension items.
*        [FALSE]
*     TARGET = LITERAL (Read)
*        A list of the names of the NDFs which contain the "target"
*        data. These are the NDFs which contain the images or spectra
*        etc.  On exit these NDFs will have their FTYPE extension item
*        set to the value "TARGET".
*        [!]
*     ZEROED = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a master bias frame is given, then this parameter indicates
*        whether or not it has a mean value of zero. If SIMPLE and
*        MULTIENTRY are TRUE then this value (TRUE or FALSE) can be entered
*        as the fourth field to the IN parameter.
*        [FALSE]

*  Examples:
*     present simple in='*' modify
*        In this example PRESENT processes all the NDFs in the current
*        directory. The NDFs should already have a valid frame type
*        (such as TARGET, FLAT etc.). The any existing global variables
*        describing the detector are accessed and written into the NDF
*        extension overwriting any values which already exist.
*
*     present simple=false bias='bias*' target='data*' dark=! flash=!
*             flat='ff*'
*        In this example the input NDFs are organised into their
*        respective frame types using the specially designed input
*        parameters. On exit the output NDFs will have the correct frame
*        types entered into their CCDPACK extensions (provided MODIFY
*        is TRUE).
*
*     present modify=false simple=true in='*'
*        In this example all the NDFs in the current directory are
*        accessed. If any required extension or global associated items
*        are missing then they will be entered into the NDF extension.
*        If all extension items are present then a listing of their
*        values will be made.
*
*     present masters simple=false masterflat="2dspectraff"
*        In this example a master flatfield is imported to be used
*        in an automated reduction of spectral data.

*  History:
*     11-FEB-1992 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     11-FEB-1994 (PDRAPER):
*        Now named PRESENT.
*     13-SEP-1995 (PDRAPER):
*        Added description of MULTIENTRY (was tempted to keep this a
*        secret as only used by xreduce).
*     8-NOV-1995 (PDRAPER):
*        Added ONEFILTER as needed for scripts.
*     13-NOV-1995 (PDRAPER):
*        Added ability to present MASTERS, so that spectral FFs can be
*        imported (and others).
*     29-JUN-2000 (MBT):
*        Replaced use of IRH/IRG with GRP/NDG.
