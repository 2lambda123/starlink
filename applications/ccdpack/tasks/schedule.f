      SUBROUTINE SCHEDULE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     SCHEDULE

*  Purpose:
*     Schedules an automated CCDPACK reduction.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL SCHEDULE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine accepts a list of input NDFs and uses the information
*     in their CCDPACK extensions to schedule a reduction. The schedule
*     is produced as a command script which may be executed immediately
*     or retained for execution using the standard CCDPACK facilities
*     (CCDFORK).
*
*     The reduction schedule produced covers the following stages of
*     data reduction (this is order).
*
*        1) production of a master bias
*        2) removal of the bias contribution
*        3) production of a master dark
*        4) removal of dark count contribution
*        5) production of a master pre-flash
*        6) removal of pre-flash contribution
*        5) production of master flatfields (one for each filter type)
*        6) correction of data for flatfield response
*
*     The stages which are preformed for each NDF depend on the type of
*     NDF (TARGET, FLAT, BIAS, DARK etc.) and any processing which has
*     already taken place. For instance if calibration masters of any
*     type already exist then they will be used in preference to the
*     production of any new masters. If all the TARGET frames have
*     already been flatfielded then no further processing will be
*     performed, if no BIAS frames of any type exist then debiassing
*     will be performed using bias strip interpolation or by
*     subtracting a single constant etc. Reductions which have failed
*     (due to a lack of resources) can be "picked up" and restarted
*     from the position at which they failed (by a re-invocation of
*     this routine). Facilities for controlling the use of disk space
*     are also available.
*
*     Before you can use this routine you must make sure that all the
*     necessary information is entered into the NDF extensions. You can
*     do this using the routines IMPORT or CCDSETUP and PRESENT or any
*     combination of these which give the desired effect.

*  Usage:
*     schedule in script stype debias=? execute=? interp=? spacesave=?

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DARKEXT = LITERAL (Read)
*       The extension which added to the names of any NDFs processed by
*       CALCOR when performing dark count correction. This makes the
*       parameter
*
*          OUT=*"darkext"
*
*       form the names of the NDFs output from CALCOR.
*       [-dk]
*     DEBIAS = _INTEGER (Read)
*       The form of debiassing that should be used. This is an integer
*       which represents one of the following:
*          1 = produce a master and offset to bias strips (master bias
*              is zeroed)
*          2 = produce a master and do not offset to strips (in this
*              case the master bias is not zeroed)
*          3 = use interpolation between bias strip(s)
*          4 = subtract a constant as bias.
*
*       Using the information about the frame types which are available
*       and the presence or not of bias strips etc. a list of the
*       possible debiassing options is shown, before this parameter is
*       accessed. Any of the above methods can be selected regardless
*       of this advice, but the reduction may then fail unless action is
*       taken (such as adapting the output script).
*
*       If the interpolation option is selected then the method is
*       determined by the INTERP parameter.
*     DEBIASEXT = LITERAL (Read)
*       The extension which added to the names of any NDFs processed by
*       DEBIAS. This makes the parameter
*
*          OUT=*"debiasext"
*
*       form the names of the NDFs output from DEBIAS.
*       [-db]
*     EXECUTE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*       Whether to execute the output command script immediately or not.
*       If the option to execute is chosen then a background
*       process is started which performs the actual execution.
*       Do not execute the procedure using this method if your system
*       supports a queuing system which should be used instead (if you
*       expect the reduction to take some time). This option does not
*       work for ICL scripts at this time.
*       [FALSE]
*     EXELOGFILE = LITERAL (Read)
*       If the reduction is started immediately then the output will be
*       redirected to this file.
*       [SCHEDULE.LOG]
*     FLASHEXT = LITERAL (Read)
*       The extension which added to the names of any NDFs processed by
*       CALCOR when performing pre-flash correction. This makes the
*       parameter
*
*          OUT=*"flashext"
*
*       form the names of the NDFs output from CALCOR.
*       [-dk]
*     FLATEXT = LITERAL (Read)
*       The extension which added to the names of any NDFs processed by
*       FLATCOR. This makes the parameter
*
*          OUT=*"flatext"
*
*       form the names of the NDFs output from FLATCOR.
*       [-flt]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*       A list of the names of the NDFs which contain the data to be
*       reduced. All NDFs must already have the correct "frame type"
*       information (extension item FTYPE) entered into their CCDPACK
*       extensions. Together with any other relevant information (such
*       as filter type, position of the bias strips, useful area etc.,
*       see IMPORT and/or PRESENT).
*
*       The NDF names should be separated by commas and may include
*       wildcards.
*     INTERP = _INTEGER (Read)
*       If the interpolation method is chosen using the DEBIAS parameter
*       then this parameter controls how the interpolation should be
*       performed. The possible returns are:
*
*          1 = fit a constant for each row/column
*          2 = fit a single value for whole NDF
*          3 = fit a line to each row/column
*          4 = fit a plane to whole NDF
*
*       The possible options given the input information about the
*       presence of bias strips are shown before the value of this
*       parameter is accessed.
*     IRFLATS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*       This parameter allows input frames of type TARGET to be also
*       used as flatfields. This is designed for use when no real
*       flatfields exist. IR data is often calibrated in this way, and
*       less commonly optical data. In both these cases it is asummed
*       that the objects are moved on the sky sufficiently, between
*       exposures, so that taking the median of a stack of frames
*       results in the rejection of any object data (leaving the
*       equivalent of a map of a blank piece of sky).
*
*       TARGET frames will only be used to create flatfields, if no
*       flatfields (of the correct colour) are present in the input list.
*       [FALSE]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*       Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*       this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*       the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*       If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP,
*       then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*       default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*       [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*       Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*       for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*       This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*       unique abbreviation of the following:
*          -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*          -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                          LOGFILE parameter)
*          -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                          logfile
*          -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*       If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*       then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*       default is "BOTH".
*       [BOTH]
*     MASTERBIAS = LITERAL (Read)
*       The name which will be given to a master bias NDF if one is
*       created.
*       [MASTER_BIAS]
*     MASTERDARK = LITERAL (Read)
*       The name which will be given to a master dark NDF if one is
*       created.
*       [MASTER_DARK]
*     MASTERFLASH = LITERAL (Read)
*       The name which will be given to a master flash NDF if one is
*       created.
*       [MASTER_FLASH]
*     MASTERFLAT = LITERAL (Read)
*       The prefix of the name which will be given to any master flat
*       NDFs which are created. The filter name will be appended to
*       this.
*       [MASTER_FLAT]
*     SCRIPT = LITERAL (Read)
*       The name of the output file which will contain the CCDPACK
*       commands which need to be executed to perform the reduction. The
*       nature of this script is controlled by the STYPE parameter. The
*       default name is dynamically set to be SCHEDULE with a type set
*       by the choice of STYPE. The extension of the script name should
*       always be the same as STYPE.
*       [schedule."stype"]
*     SPACESAVE = LITERAL (Read)
*       This parameter controls if any disk space management should be
*       used or not. It can take one of the values, "NONE", "SOME" or
*       "LOTS".
*
*          "NONE" indicates that no NDFs should be deleted.
*          "SOME" indicates that all intermediate NDFs should be
*                 deleted. This occurs after they are processed.
*          "LOTS" indicates that all processed NDFs should be deleted.
*                 In this case all intermediary NDFs and the original
*                 NDFs are deleted when processed.
*
*       Intermediary NDFs are deleted by the CCDPACK applications when
*       they are finished processing then. So for instance in the case
*       of FLATCOR each NDF is deleted in turn, so the additional disk
*       space required is one NDF. Using "SOME" preserves the original
*       NDFs. Calibration masters are never deleted.
*       [NONE]
*     STYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*       The type of CCDPACK command procedure to be produced. This
*       should be one of "CSH" or "ICL". Once a type has been
*       chosen the output script (parameter SCRIPT) can only be
*       executed using the selected interpreter. Note that if you
*       choose ICL then the resultant script cannot be executed
*       immediately, you must activate this yourself.
*       [CSH]

*  Examples:
*     schedule '*' ccdreduce csh debias=1
*        This example processes all the NDFs in the current directory
*        producing a script file called ccdreduce.csh which is suitable
*        for executing from the C-shell. The debiassing method chosen is
*        to use a zeroed master bias which is offset to the bias strip
*        data level.
*     schedule '*' ccdreduce csh debias=1 execute=true
*        As above except that the script ccdreduce.csh is forked into a
*        background process and executed. The output from this job will
*        be found in the file schedule.log.
*     schedule '*' tryinterp debias=3 interp=3
*        In this example the debiassing is performed using interpolation
*        between the bias strips.
*     schedule spacesave=lots
*        In this example the command script will be written so that all
*        intermediary NDFs (those produced by the various applications)
*        and the original raw NDFs, will be deleted as and when they are
*        processed.
*     schedule 'data*' irflats debias=4
*        In this example the frames 'data*' are scheduled for reduction.
*        The debiassing method is subtraction of a constant (this should
*        be set by PRESENT) and a flatfield is produced by median stacking
*        all the data frames.
