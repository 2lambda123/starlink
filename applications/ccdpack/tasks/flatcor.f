      SUBROUTINE FLATCOR( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FLATCOR

*  Purpose:
*     Divides a series of images by a flatfield

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FLATCOR( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*    This routine applies a flat field correction to a series of images.
*    If any of the input data have been flagged as saturated using a
*    saturation value (instead of being marked as BAD) then the
*    saturation values may be protected from modification.

*  Usage:
*     flatcor in out flat

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FLAT = LITERAL (Read)
*        Name of the image which contains the normalised (mean of one)
*        flatfield data. This should have been produced by a program 
*        such as MAKEFLAT. The data should have a floating point HDS 
*        data type (_REAL or _DOUBLE).  If USESET is true, FLAT should
*        be a group expression referring to one flatfield data file
*        matching each of the Set Index attributes represented in the 
*        IN list; again the name of the file produced by MAKEFLAT will 
*        normally be suitable.  The name of this file may be specified
*        using indirection through a file.
*        [Global flatfield]
*     IN = LITERAL (Read)
*        Names of the images containing the data which are to have the
*        flatfield correction applied.  The image names should be
*        separated by commas and may include wildcards.
*     KEEPIN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether to keep (i.e. not delete) the input images (parameter IN)
*        or not. Deleting the input images has the advantage of saving
*        disk space, but should probably only be used if this program
*        is part of a sequence of commands and the intermediary data
*        produced by it are not important.
*
*        The calibration master frame (parameter FLAT) is never deleted.
*
*        The default for this parameter is TRUE and this cannot be
*        overridden except by assignment on the command line or in
*        response to a forced prompt.
*        [TRUE]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP,
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "CCDPACK.LOG".
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*
*        If the logging system has been initialised using CCDSETUP
*        then the value specified there will be used. Otherwise, the
*        default is "BOTH".
*        [BOTH]
*     OUT = LITERAL (Write)
*        Names of the output images. These may be specified as list of
*        comma separated names, using indirection if required, or,
*        as a single modification element (of the input names).
*        The simplest modification element is the asterisk "*" which
*        means call each of the output NDFs the same name as the
*        corresponding input images. So,
*           IN > *
*           OUT > *
*        signifies that all the images in the current directory should be
*        used and the output images should have the same names.
*
*        Other types of modification can also
*        occur, such as,
*           OUT > tmp_*
*        which means call the output images the same as the input images but
*        put tmp_ in front of the names. Replacement of a specified
*        string with another in the output file names can also be used,
*           OUT > tmp_*|debias|flattened|
*        this replaces the string debias with flattened in any of the
*        output names tmp_*.
*     SATURATION = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The value at which the input data has been saturated. This 
*        is only required if the saturation has been flagged using a 
*        non-BAD value.
*        [1.0D6]
*     SETSAT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If the input data has had a saturation value applied then this
*        value should be set to TRUE. However, if the saturation has
*        been applied within CCDPACK then this will not be necessary as
*        this information will have been stored in the CCDPACK
*        extension.  Note that data with different saturation
*        properties (i.e. saturation values) which have not been set
*        within CCDPACK will require separate processing (see notes).
*        [FALSE]
*     PRESERVE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If the input data types are to be preserved and used for
*        processing then this parameter should be set TRUE [default].
*        If this parameter is set FALSE then the input data will be
*        processed and returned in a suitable floating point
*        representation. This option is useful if the output data will
*        have a significant number of BAD values due to numeric errors
*        (over or under flow), or if unacceptable loss of precision
*        will occur if the data are processed in the original data type
*        (due to rounding errors).
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using
*        CCDSETUP then this will be used.
*        [TRUE]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Title for the output images.
*        [Output from FLATCOR]
*     USESET = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether to use Set header information or not.  If USESET is
*        false then any Set header information will be ignored. 
*        If USESET is true, then the FLAT parameter is taken to 
*        refer to a group of files, and each IN file will be processed
*        using a flatfield dataset with a Set Index attribute which
*        matches its own.  An IN file with no Set header is considered
*        to match a FLAT file with no Set header, so USESET can safely
*        be set true (the default) when the input files contain no 
*        Set header information.
*
*        If a global value for this parameter has been set using 
*        CCDSETUP then that value will be used.
*        [FALSE]

*  Examples:
*     flatcor frame1 frame1_f flatr
*        In this example the data in image frame1 are corrected for the
*        flatfield response stored in image flatr. The result of dividing
*        FRAME1 by flatr is written to image frame1_f. If a saturation
*        value has been applied to the data in frame1 then this will be
*        automatically accommodated by FLATCOR providing the saturation
*        has been applied within CCDPACK.
*
*     flatcor n4151r1 n4151r1f flatfield setsat=true saturation=32767
*        In this example the data have had a saturation value applied
*        which has not been recorded within CCDPACK and the required 
*        information has been supplied.
*
*     flatcor in='*' out='*_flattened' flat=master_flatr
*        In this example all the images in the current directory are
*        processed. The resultant data are written to files with the
*        same name as the corresponding input images, but with the 
*        characters "_flattened" appended to the filename.

*  Notes:
*     - If any of the input data have had their saturation values set by
*       applications not within CCDPACK, then this routine will require
*       this information if the values are to be propagated properly. If
*       more than one saturation value has been used then the input
*       frames will need to be processed singly. This is because FLATCOR
*       only uses one saturation value per input group. If the 
*       saturation values have been set within CCDPACK (by DEBIAS) 
*       these will be processed correctly and may be different.

*  Behaviour of parameters:
*     Most parameters retain their current value as default. The
*     "current" value is the value assigned on the last run of the
*     application. If the application has not been run then the
*     "intrinsic" defaults, as shown in the parameter help, apply.
*     The exceptions to this rule are:
*        - TITLE   -- always "Output from FLATCOR"
*        - KEEPIN  -- always TRUE
*
*     Retaining parameter values has the advantage of allowing you to
*     define the default behaviour of the application but does mean
*     that additional care needs to be taken when using the application
*     on new datasets/different devices, or after a break of sometime.
*     The intrinsic default behaviour of the application may be
*     restored by using the RESET keyword on the command line.
*
*     Certain parameters (LOGTO, LOGFILE, PRESERVE, FLAT and USESET) have
*     global values. These global values will always take precedence,
*     except when an assignment is made on the command line.  In general
*     global values may be set and reset using the CCDSETUP and
*     CCDCLEAR commands, however, the FLAT parameter may only be set by
*     a run of the application MAKEFLAT.

*  Implementation Status:
*     - Supports processing of all non-complex numeric types.
*       BAD pixels are processed as are all NDF components.
