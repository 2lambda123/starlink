#  History:
#     29-NOV-1993 (DLT):
#        Original version.
#     21-MAR-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Brought into CCDPACK from Xadam (was named gethelp).
#     22-MAR-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Added facility to use netscape (1.1) as well as Mosaic.
#     17-APR-1997 (PDRAPER):
#        Modified to show a message when an existing browser is
#        found (which is not started here). This is meant to
#        draw the users attention when the browser is iconified.
#     22-JUL-2003 (MBT):
#        Added the ability to use Mozilla.
#     31-JAN-2006 (PDRAPER):
#        Added firefox (another mozilla/netscape variant).
