#  Name:
#     ccdalign.tcl

#  Purpose:
#     Script to do the work for the CCDALIGN application.

#  Language:
#     Tcl.

#  Description:
#     This script uses [incr Tcl] classes to present a GUI to the user
#     which allows selection of a matching set of points on each one.

#  External Variables:
#     ERROR = string (Returned)
#        If returned as a non-empty string, this should give the text
#        of an error to be presented to the user.  This indicates that
#        the routine did not complete successfully.
#     MARKSTYLE = string (Given and Returned)
#        A string, in the form of comma-separated att=value pairs,
#        indicating how markers should be plotted on the image.
#     MAXCANV = integer (Given and Returned)
#        The maximum X or Y dimension of the canvas in which the initial
#        NDF is to be displayed.  If zero, there is no limit.
#     NDFSETS = list of lists (Given)
#        Each element of this list represents a set of NDFs which is
#        to be presented to the user for aligning using this script.
#        The format of each element is {setname ndfname ?ndfname ...?}.
#        The setname is a text name of each set which is to be presented
#        to the user (it may be blank, in which case the name of the
#        first NDF will be used), and each ndfname is the name of one
#        of the NDFs which is to be a member of that set.
#     NPOINT = list of integers (Returned)
#        The number of points for each set.  The Nth entry in this
#        list contains the number of points selected for the Nth set
#        in the NDFSETS variable.
#     PERCHI = real (Given and Returned)
#        The percentile of the data above which all values should be
#        plotted as the same colour.  Must be between 0 and 100.
#     PERCLO = real (Given and Returned)
#        The percentile of the data below which all values should be
#        plotted as the same colour.  Must be between 0 and 100.
#     POINTS = list of lists of lists (Returned)
#        The points selected on the images.  The Nth entry in this list
#        contains data for the Nth set in the NDFSETS variable.
#        The entry for each NDF is a list containing one entry for each
#        selected point.  The entry for each point is a three-element
#        list containing the point index number, X coordinate and
#        Y coordinate respectively.  The X and Y coordinates are given
#        in Pixel coordinates if the corresponding element was a single
#        NDF (the ndfset had only one member) and in CCD_SET coordinates
#        if the corresponding ndfset had more than one member.
#     REFSET = integer (Given)
#        The position in the list NDFSETS of the set to be used as the
#        reference image (the first image in the list has index 0).
#     WINX = integer (Given and Returned)
#        X dimension of the window used for NDF display.
#     WINY = integer (Given and Returned)
#        Y dimension of the window used for NDF display.
#     ZOOM = real (Given and Returned)
#        The zoom factor for NDF display; may be limited by the value of
#        MAXCANV.
