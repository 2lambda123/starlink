   proc CCDUpdateLabelCount { Reveal name Box } {
#+
#  Name:
#     CCDUpdateLabelCount

#  Purpose:
#     Updates a named button of a Ccd::reveal widget to reflect the count
#     of entries in a listbox-like widget.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure.

#  Description:
#     This routine is for updating the text description of one of a set
#     of buttons created by the Ccd::reveal widget. The text is updated to 
#     show a count of the number of entries in the associated window 
#     (which should be a listbox-like widget, such as a scrollbox or 
#     table). This is used by the CCDNDFDoImport procedure.

#  Arguments:
#     Reveal = window (read)
#       The name of the Ccd::reveal widget whose button labels are to be 
#       changed to reflect the contents of an associated listbox-like 
#       widget.
#     name = string (read)
#       The name of the button (i.e. its creation name). The new name
#       will be this name followed by a count of the contents in brackets.
#     Box = window (read)
#       Name of the scrollbox-like widget associated with name.
