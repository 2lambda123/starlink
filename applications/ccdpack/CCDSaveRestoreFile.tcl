   proc CCDSaveRestoreFile { filename } {
#+
#  Name:
#     CCDSaveRestoreFile.tcl

#  Purpose:
#     Saves the current global parameter setup to the named file.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tk/Tcl

#  Description:
#     This routine opens the named file and writes the contents of the
#     global parameter array CCDglobalpars into it. The form used is
#     the same as that of CCDSETUP and which can also be read by
#     CCDReadRestoreFile . A header of useful information is also
#     written to the file.

#  Arguments:
#     filename = string (read)
#        The name of the file which is to have the current global setup
#        written to it.

#  Global Parameters:
#      CCDglobalpars = array (read)
#         The array of global parameter values.

#  Return:
#      CCDrestorefile = logical (write)
#         If the write is successful then the return is set to 1
#          otherwise it is 0.
