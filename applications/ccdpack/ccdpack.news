1 CCDPACK_minor_update
 
  This is a minor update to CCDPACK. 

  The applications FINDOFF and REGISTER have been modified to open up
  to 100 input and 100 output files. Previously these programs where
  limited to 40 files in total. 

  CCDPACK is fully described in SUN/139 and can be viewed on-line using 
  the "showme sun139" command. The latest information about CCDPACK 
  problems is always available at:
