#  Purpose:
#     Default style file for plots in CCDPACK.

#  Description:
#     This file gives the default style values passed to AST for 
#     specifying the appearance of AST plots in certain CCDPACK 
#     graphical applications.  In some cases, these defaults can
#     be overridded by use of an ADAM parameter, normally called 
#     'STYLE'.

#        Original version.  Took values from the corresponding KAPPA
#        default style file.

#  Set values for general attributes recognised by all applications:
#  =================================================================

#  Speed up plotting of borders, grids, etc, by reducing the Tol attribute.
      tol=0.002

#  Always draw a border around the regions of the plot containing
#  valid co-ordinates. Make it twice wider the default width.
      border=1
      width(border)=2.0

#  Include textual labels describing the axes.
      textlab(1)=1
      textlab(2)=1

#  Set colours for various elements of the plot.
      colour(border)=4
      colour(grid)=3
      colour(ticks)=3
      colour(numlab)=5
      colour(axes)=3

#  Set the size of the text to use for numerical and textual axis labels.
#  These are slightly smaller than the default sizes of 1.0.
      size(numlab)=0.8
      size(textlab)=0.9

#  Set the gaps between the axes and the associated textual labels. The default
#  is 0.01.
      textlabgap(1)=0.05
      textlabgap(2)=0.05

#  Make the ticks marks (both major and minor) longer. The defaults are
#  0.015 for major ticks and 0.007 for minor ticks.
      majticklen(1)=0.02
      majticklen(2)=0.02
      minticklen(1)=0.01
      minticklen(2)=0.01
