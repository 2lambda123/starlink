#  Name:
#     CCDSaveImportTable 

#  Purpose:
#     Saves an import table described in two listboxes managed by the
#     CCDCreateImportTable interface. 

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk procedure

#  Description:
#     This routine reads the contents of two listboxes which should
#     described a FITS import control table (as created by the
#     procedure CCDCreateImportTable). The first listbox contains the
#     FITS keywords which are to be extracted from the NDF FITS block
#     and the second the expressions of the FITS keywords which result
#     in a value for the named extension item.

#  Arguments:
#     savefile = filename (read)
#        The name of a file to contain the saved import information.
#     fitsbox = window (read)
#        The name of a listbox which contains type and keyword names
#        of FITS items to be extracted from the FITS block.
#     extenbox = window (read)
#        The name of a listbox which contains the names of the
#        destination extension items and the expressions of FITS
#        keywords which result in a value.

#  Returned Value:
#     CCDSaveImportTable = boolean
#        If a file is written successfully then this returns true (1)
#        otherwise false (0)
