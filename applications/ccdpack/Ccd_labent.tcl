#  Name:
#     Ccd::labent

#  Purpose:
#     Defines widget consisting of an label and an entry widget.

#  Language:
#     TCL

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Description:
#     This routine defines a widget class which consist of a label
#     widget and an entry widget. A labelled entry widget.

#  Configuration Options:
#        -text  "string"
#
#     Set the text string of the label widget. Defaults to "label".
#
#        -placelabel "left|right|top|bottom"
#
#     The place that the label is put with respect to the entry widget.
#     Must be one of left, right, top or bottom.
#
#        -textvariable global_variable_name
#
#     Specifies a global variable to contain the contents of the entry
#     widget. This is updated at all times to contain the contents of
#     the entry widget (and vice-versa).
#
#        -width [width]
#
#     Sets the width of the entry widget (usually in characters). If the
#     value for width is not supplied then the current width is
#     returned.
#
#        -state (normal|disabled)
#
#     Sets the state of the entry widget. Disabled means that text
#     cannot be entered.

#  Inheritance:
#     This widget inherits methods and configuration options from the
#     following superclasses.
#
#        Ccd::base
#
#     These should be consulted for the methods and options which they
#     supply.

#  Invocations:
#        Ccd::labent window 
#
#     Returns a command "window" which is available in the global scope.
#     This may be optionally followed by any of the configuration
#     options.
#
#        window configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the widget
#     instance has been created).
#
#        window method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this widget.

#  Methods:
#     constructor
#        Creates the widget command.
#
#        This method is invoked automatically when the class is asked to
#        create an object. It is also invoked by classes which inherit
#        from this class (this happens after the constructor method of
#        the inheriting class unless the constructor of this class is
#        invoked explicitly). 
#     destructor
#        Deletes the widget command via the "delete" method.
#     configure
#        Activates the configuration options. 
#     get
#        Returns the contents of the entry widget.
#     clear args
#        Clears the contents of the entry widget. The args are those
#        which the entry widget "delete" command expects. I.e. a first
#        and (optional) last index.
#     insert args
#        Inserts text into the entry widget. The args are those used by
#        the entry widget. I.e. an index and the text string.
#     sethelp document label.
#        Sets the context sensitive help information for all the 
#        components of the meta-widget that exist. $document should be
#        the name of a HTML document and $label the label (HTML
#        anchor) within the document that identifies the part to be
#        displayed.
