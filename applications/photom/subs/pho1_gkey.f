      SUBROUTINE PHO1_GKEY( NCARD, BUFFER, NAME, THERE, VALUE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PHO1_GKEY

*  Purpose:
*     Gets the value of a floating point FITS keyword.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PHO1_GKEY( NCARD, BUFFER, NAME, THERE, VALUE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine searches a buffer containing the header card images
*     from a FITS extension for a keyword NAME; and returns its value, 
*     and the number of the card image within the buffer array that 
*     contains the named keyword.  The search ends when the next end 
*     of a header block, marked by the END keyword, is encountered 
*     or the buffer is exhausted.  If the keyword is present THERE 
*     is true, otherwise it is false. An error status will be returned 
*     if the conversion to floating point fails. If a keyword is not 
*     found then no error results and the argument VALUE remains 
*     unmodified.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of card images in the buffer.
*     BUFFER( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * 80 (Given)
*        The buffer containing the header card images.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the keyword whose value is required.
*     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        If true the keyword NAME is present (regardless of exit
*        status).
*     VALUE = REAL (Returned)
*        The value of the keyword.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Global status value.
