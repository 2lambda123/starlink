*+  LOCATE - locates the centroid of a star-like image feature in a 2-d 
*            array

      SUBROUTINE LOCATE ( INARR, DIM1, DIM2, XINIT, YINIT, SEARCH,
     :                    POSTIV, MXSHFT, MAXITE, TOLER, XFINAL, YFINAL,
     :                    STATUS )
*
*    Description :
*
*     This routine locates the centroid of a star-like feature within
*     a defined search area in an image about suggested starting
*     co-ordinates, and returns the final centroid position.
*
*     The routine forms marginal profiles within a search square, and
*     then subtracts a background estimate from each profile, before
*     finding the profile centroids. This is repeated for a specified
*     number of iterations, until the requested accuracy is met, or
*     until one of several error conditions is met.
*
*    Invocation :

*
*     13-01-1986 : First Rapi2d implementation - direct copy from
*                : Rodney Warren-Smith's EDRS routine of same name.
*                : (REVA::MJM)
*     1986 Aug 14: Completed prologue, partially conformed to Starlink 
*                  programming standards (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1986 Sep 4 : Renamed parameters section to arguments, applied
*                  bad-pixel handling via global constants rather
*                  than by argument (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1988 Jul 5 : Repeat of 1988 May changes, viz. removed ERROR
*                  argument, improved "Method :" section, and added
*                  error reporting (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1989 Jul 27: Passed array dimensions as separate variables
*                  (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1990 Jan 19: No centroid found leaves final co-ordinates undefined
*                  rather than equal to the initial co-ordinates
*                  (RL.STAR::CUR).
*     1990 Mar 5 : Output co-ordinates conform to the Starlink standard
*                  instead of being pixel indices as before (RAL::CUR).
*     1990 Aug 1 : Fixed the previous change, which was incorrect
*                  (RAL::CUR).
*     1992 Jan 7 : Check denominators in moment calculation are non-zero
*                  (DUVAD::NE).
