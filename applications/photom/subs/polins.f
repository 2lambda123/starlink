*  Name :
*     POLINS
*
*  Purpose :
*     This computes the intersection of a polygon and a square using the
*     plane sweep technique.
*
*  Language :
*     FORTRAN
*
*  Invocation :
*     CALL POLINS ( NL, L, NR, R, NS, SQUARE, YLIST, LYLIST,
*    :              RYLIST, NP, INSL, INSR )
*
*  Description :
*     This computes the intersection of a polygon and a square using the
*     plane sweep technique. The polygon is defined by its two monotone
*     polygonal sectors ( MPS ) l and r which list the vertices between the
*     highest and lowest points of the poygon.
*     The intersection is given as a resultant list of vertices in two MPS
*     insl and insr of the same length.
*     The vertices of the square must be given according to the following
*     plan  2 - 1
*           |   |
*           3 - 4  i.e. anti-clockwise from top right.
*
*     NOTE. The validity of the MPS arrays are assumed, and not checked.

*     10-JAN-1988 (NE):
*        Used calls to HINSEC rather than INSECT.

*        Added PLL & PRR variables to trap PL-1 & PR-1 array indices
*        being 0 on occasion.

*   the list starts ( terminates ) with the first ( last ) vertex of the

*   Test for the intersection of the polygon and square using a

*   The top and bottom of the square is also used. This is the plane sweep
*   Some of the values in ylist may have the same value. These only have
*   to be tested once so skip over repeated values.
