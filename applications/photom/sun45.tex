\section{\xlabel{introduction}Introduction}

PHOTOM is a package for performing photometry of digitized images.
It has two basic modes of operation: using an interactive display
to specify the positions for the measurements, or obtaining those
positions from a file. In both modes of operation PHOTOM allows you
to perform photometry using either the traditional aperture method
or via optimal extraction. When using the traditional aperture extraction
method the target aperture can be circular or elliptical and its size
and shape can be varied interactively on the display, or by entering
values from the keyboard. Both methods allow the background sky level
to be either sampled interactively by the manual positioning of an
aperture, or automatically from an annulus surrounding the target object.

PHOTOM is also used by the Graphical Astronomy and Image Analysis tool
(\xref{GAIA -- SUN/214}{sun214}{}) which integrates the tasks of
photometry with an image display tool. This allows the
detailed inspection of objects and their environments and provides
a highly interactive environment for placing, rotating and resizing
apertures.

\section{\xlabel{new_to_aperture_photometry}New to aperture photometry?}

If you are new to aperture photometry then you should read the
\htmlref{section}{techniques} on techniques of aperture photometry
\latex{in appendix \ref{techniques}}. You should also read the Starlink
Cookbook ``CCD Photometric Calibration'' (\xref{SC/6}{sc6}{}). If you
have any questions beyond what these offer (which are elementary
texts) then you should get friendly with a local expert or be prepared
to delve into the literature.

\section{\xlabel{new_to_optimal_photometry}New to optimal photometry?}

If you are going to be using the optimal extraction features of PHOTOM then
it is recommended that you should read the MNRAS paper ``An optimal extraction algorithm for imaging photometry'' (\htmladdnormallink{MNRAS, 1998, 296, 339}{http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998MNRAS.296..339N&db_key=AST\&{}high=365efe227210385}) which discusses this algorithm in depth. However, a brief \htmlref{discussion}{explaining} of the algorithim is given later \latex{in appendix \ref{explaining}}.

\section{\xlabel{running_the_photom_software}Running the photom software}

To initialize the PHOTOM package so that you can run its programs from
the C-shell you use the command:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photomstart
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
(after setting yourself up to run Starlink software -
see `Setting up your environment' in \xref{SUN/145}{sun145}{}).

Similarly to set up PHOTOM to run from within \xref{ICL}{sg5}{} use:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ICL> photomstart
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\subsection{\xlabel{getting_help}Getting help}

On-line help is available for all the PHOTOM programs using the command:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photomhelp
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
from the C-shell, or by using the command:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ICL> help photom
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
when running ICL. Help can also be found by specifying ? or ?? as the
reply to any program prompt.

As an alternative to these approaches this document may also be viewed
on-line using a hypertext browser. To do this use the command:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% showme sun45
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

If you come across any bugs or problems when using PHOTOM then e-mail
a description to: \texttt{bugs@star.rl.ac.uk}.

\section{\xlabel{performing_interactive_analyses}Performing interactive analyses}

Interactive measurement is performed in
PHOTOM using a program which is also called PHOTOM\footnote{At one
time this program was the only application in PHOTOM, hence the
now slightly confusing terminology.}. Alternatively, if
it is available on your system, you can use the photometry
toolbox which is part of the \xref{GAIA}{sun214}{} (SUN/214) display
tool. In the following discussion it is assumed that you are using
the PHOTOM program.

The first thing you need to do is display your image. Although PHOTOM
can work using a display that does not have an overlay, it is best
to have one. This is so that any line graphics which PHOTOM draws can
be erased. Without this ability the display becomes quickly confused,
particularly when setting the size and orientation of the aperture.

You can create a \xref{GWM X-windows}{sun130}{} display with an overlay
using the command:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% xmake xwindows -overlay -ovcolour green
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
and can display an image in this window either using the
\xref{KAPPA (SUN/95)}{sun95}{}
\xref{DISPLAY}{sun95}{DISPLAY} program, or if this isn't available
the \htmlref{PHOTGREY}{PHOTGREY} program.

You can now start up the main PHOTOM program by typing the command:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photom
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
this could be from the C-shell or ICL.

The first response from this program is a request for the name of the
image you have just displayed. This image remains open until you exit
from PHOTOM. If you need to measure objects in another image then you
should exit PHOTOM, display the new image and then restart PHOTOM.

The next request should be for a parameter ``COMMAND'' which indicates that
you are now in the main command loop of PHOTOM. Your response to this
prompt should be a single character. To see a menu of the possible
commands return a \st{h} (or \st{H}).

The first time one of the interactive graphical options: I --
interactive shape (aperture photometry only); or M -- interactive
measurement is selected the name of the display device is requested.
If you are using an image display with overlay capabilities then
remember that the overlay device is not the same as the device you
displayed your image in, e.g. if you displayed on an X-windows device
\st{xw}, then the overlay device is called \st{xov}.

Typically the cursor position is controlled by the mouse and the mouse
button meanings are indicated by three menu boxes drawn on the screen.
If you use an unusual display device without a mouse then the graphics
are controlled by the keyboard. A message from PHOTOM shows which of
these options applies to you.

\subsection{\xlabel{the_photom_menu_options}The PHOTOM menu options}
The following section describes each of the menu items that you can use
at the COMMAND prompt.

\subsubsection{A --- annulus}

This is a toggle switch which alters the way in which the background
level is measured. There are two methods available. The first is
interactive, and uses an aperture identical in size and shape to the
object aperture. The aperture is positioned manually to select the
region of sky to measure. The message \st{Interactive aperture in use}
will signify that this has been chosen.

When using the interactive aperture, several sky areas can be sampled
to improve the estimate of the sky. The sky estimates from each
aperture are simply summed, and the mean of these is used when the
object is measured.

The alternative is to use an aperture which is a concentric annulus
around the object aperture. In this mode the sky is measured
automatically every time a measurement is made. The message
\st{Concentric aperture in use} signifies this choice. The size of the
sky aperture is specified by the INNER and OUTER parameters. These are
defined as multiplying factors of the object aperture size, or in optimal
extraction mode of the clipping radius, e.g. if INNER were 2 and OUTER 3
then the sky aperture would start at two radii from the centre and end at
three radii.

When starting PHOTOM one of these modes will be chosen as the default.
This choice is controlled by the CONCEN parameter.
If the positions of the objects is entered by a file of positions
(command F), then the background is automatically taken with the
concentric annulus, whatever the default value of CONCEN.

\subsubsection{C --- centroid}

This is a toggle switch which alters whether the object is centered in
the aperture before doing the measurement. Centroiding is
controlled by the parameters SEARCH, POSITIVE, MAXSHIFT, MAXITER and
TOLER. These cannot be changed from within the program, and if
alternative values are required they should be given on the
command-line when starting PHOTOM. For instance:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photom positive=f
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
would make PHOTOM centroid on objects whose signal was negative (not a
very likely choice).

The choice of mode is indicated by the messages \st{Centroiding in stellar
aperture}, or \st{No centroiding}. When starting PHOTOM one of these modes
will be chosen as the default. Centroiding cannot be turned off when using optimal extraction.

Unless the field under investigation is very crowded, or there are other
special conditions, it is probably best to leave the centroiding option
on all the time. This is more important if the measurements are being
made in non-interactive mode (command F); unless you're certain
that the positions are accurate for all images.

\subsubsection{E --- exit}

This command exits PHOTOM.

\subsubsection{F --- file of positions}

This command causes the measurements to be done automatically. A file
containing the positions is requested, and the photometry is performed
with the current parameters.

The name of the file containing the positions is requested through the
POSFILE parameter. If the file cannot be found or is not in a suitable
format then no action is taken.

The file of positions is an ordinary text file and should specify an
index number and the x and y positions in pixel coordinates. For every
x and y pair in the file an measurement is made, sampling the
sky with the concentric annulus, whose size is specified by the
current values of the INNER and OUTER parameters. Centroiding in the
object aperture is, or is not done, depending on the current value of
the CENTRO parameter, which is selected with command C. When the input
file is exhausted PHOTOM returns to the command level.

If optimal extraction is enabled the first entry in the the POSFILE
should have index 0 and x and y co-ordinates corresponding to
the chosen PSF star.

Results of the measurements are shown on the terminal as well as output
to the file named by the RESFILE parameter. Results are identified by
the index number associated with the x and y position in the input file.

A previous results file can be used as the input file of positions, but
it should not have the same name as the results file otherwise the
program will fail when it tries to open a new results file.

The format of the input and the results files are given with the full
\htmlref{PHOTOM description}{PHOTOM} \latex{in appendix \ref{PHOTOM}}.

\subsubsection{H --- help}

This displays a brief line of help for each command. For more extensive
information refer to this manual or the on-line help.

\subsubsection{I --- interactive shape}

This allows the size and shape of the aperture to be adjusted
interactively on the screen to best suit the objects. When using
optimal extraction this command is disabled, the clipping radius
can be changed using the O menu option.

The size and shape of the aperture is governed by the three ellipse
parameters, the semi-major axis (in pixels), eccentricity and position
angle.  The semi-major axis and eccentricity are as usually defined
for an ellipse. An eccentricity of 0 gives a circular aperture with a
radius equal to the semi-major axis. The orientation of the ellipse is
given in degrees and specifies the orientation of the semi-major axis
of the ellipse anti-clockwise with respect to the vertical axis of the
screen.

When this option is chosen five boxes appear on the graphics display.
The upper two show the parameter that will be changed and its current
value. The lower three boxes show the functions that are performed by
the mouse buttons (or keys if your device doesn't support a
mouse). Mouse button 1 (or key 1) changes the parameter to one of
SEMI-MAJOR, ECCENTRICITY or ORIENTATION. Mouse button 2 (or key 2)
changes the value of the parameter and finally mouse button 3 (or key
0) completes defining the aperture shape and returns you to the
COMMAND prompt.

The parameters only have a limited number of
preset values which can be cycled through by repeated presses of the
middle mouse button (key 2).
If the range or interval of the values associated with a parameter
aren't suitable then you can override these by setting a specific
value using the N menu option.

When a parameter value is changed, the aperture displayed at the
cursor position is updated to reflect this. The aperture is also
redisplayed whenever the first mouse button is pressed (or key 1).
As this only changes the current parameter rather than any of the
actual values, you can use this function to reposition the aperture to
inspect its suitability on more than one object (but remember to
return to the aperture parameter that you want to change before
attempting to alter a value).

The initial values of the three parameters are just the current ones.
The semi-major axis can be changed from a maximum of double to a
minimum of a half of the current value (with steps of a tenth or fifth
of this interval).  The possible values of the eccentricity and
orientation are limited, to a number of preset values. The value
initially displayed is taken to be the member of the preset table
which is closest to, but lower than, the current value of that
parameter.

\subsubsection{M --- measure}

This performs interactive measurements of objects individually selected
from the displayed frame. If using aperture extraction the size and shape
of the cursor should be set-up in advance using the I or N commands, while
the clipping radius should be set (using the 0 command) when using optimal
extraction.

There are two basic methods for measurement of background. Either the
background is sampled from an annulus around the object aperture, or
from a separately chosen area of sky (see command A). The two cases can be
distinguished at this stage from the on-screen display.

In the case of the manual sky measurement the middle box is
labelled with \texttt{SKY}, while for automatic sky measurement it
will remain empty. The left-hand box with either be labelled \texttt{STAR},
in the case of  aperture extraction, or \texttt{PSF} when optimal extraction is
selected. The remaining right-hand box will be annotated \texttt{RETURN~TO~KEYBOARD}.

To perform the measurements with the automatic sampling of the sky,
the cursor is positioned over the chosen object and the left-hand
mouse button (or key 1) is pressed. If optimal extraction is selected
the first measurement will define the point spread function (PSF) for
the technique. It is important to pick a bright star which is unsaturated
for this task. After this measurement has been taken, if you are using a terminal capable of erasable line graphics such as an \texttt{xoverlay},
then the left-hand box  label will change to read \texttt{STAR} to denote that
further measurements will be photometric.

For further measurements using optimal extraction, or all measurements
using the older aperture method an aperture is displayed where the measurement was made. For optimal extraction this ``aperture'' will be the size of
the clipping radius (the CLIP parameter). If centroiding is being done
(command C), automatic enabled for optimal extraction, then the displayed aperture may not be centered on the cursor position. The results of the measurement are printed on the terminal and recorded in the results file. Measurements can be continued until the third mouse button (key 0) is pressed.

When using manual selection of the background the middle mouse button
(key 2) is also used. Selecting this button records the sky estimate
in an aperture identical in size and shape to the object aperture, at
the position specified by the cursor. On the screen an aperture is
displayed at that position. No centroiding is done in this aperture,
even if the centroiding option is on. When the measurement of the
object is made, the most recent value of the sky is used. This means
that the sky has to be sampled BEFORE the measurement of the
object. Having a correct background estimate is crucial for optimal
extraction to such an extent that PHOTOM will not allow you to make a
star or PSF measurement using this method until a background measurement
has been provided. If the background needs to be sampled in several places around an object, to minimise the noise or take account of a sloping
background, then a sky aperture can be selected a number of times
and the mean of these values is used. The calculation of the
mean is only cleared when an object is measured, so if a mistake
has been made in estimating the mean of the skies then an object
measurement has to be made, and a note made that the measurement
was in error, before going back to the estimation of the sky. Control
stays with the interactive menu until the third mouse button (key 0)
is pressed.

The results of the measurements are displayed on the terminal and sent
to the file accessed by the RESFILE parameter.

\subsubsection{N --- non-interactive shape}

The size and shape of the aperture can be specified from the keyboard
by entering values for the semi-major axis (in pixels), the
eccentricity and the orientation of the ellipse defining the aperture.
When using optimal extraction this command is disabled, the clipping radius
can be changed using the V menu option.

An eccentricity of 0 gives a circular aperture with a radius equal
to the semi-major axis. The orientation of the ellipse is given in
degrees and specifies the rotation of the semi-major axis of the
ellipse anti-clockwise with respect to the vertical axis of the pixel
array.

\subsubsection{O --- options}

This allows changes of the values of some of the non-aperture shape
related parameters.

The INNER and OUTER parameters define the size of the annulus to be
used in the automatic sampling of the sky. The annulus has the same
elliptical shape as the object aperture, but is larger by the factors
given by INNER and OUTER. These two parameters are given in terms of
multiplicative factors of the semi-major axis of the object aperture.
Thus an INNER radius of 1 means that the sky annulus starts where the
object aperture ends. The annulus thus grows and shrinks with changes
to the object aperture.

The PADU parameter defines the number of photons for each interval of
the data. Multiplying the data value in each pixel by PADU gives the
number of photons recorded (after correcting for BIASLE). If this
parameter is unknown then leave it at 1. It is {\bf necessary to provide
an estimate of this number} if optimal extraction is to be carried
out correctly.

The SKYMAG parameter specifies the magnitude to be given to the sky
when calculating the magnitude of the object. The magnitude of the
object is calculated from
$mag = SKYMAG - 2.5 \log_{10}(signal)$
where signal is the brightness of the object minus sky in photons.
This parameter is not used if USEMAGS is set to FALSE (in this case
the output is not in magnitudes).

The BIASLE parameter gives the level in data units of any offset in
the bias level per pixel. This is needed if there is any non-photon
source of background, and proper photon statistics are required. If
this parameter is unknown then leave it at 0.

The SATURE parameter is the saturation level for the image in data
units. If there are any pixels in the object aperture with values
greater than the saturation level then this is indicated by an error
code 'S' in the final column of the output table. The object magnitude
is calculated with the saturated pixel \textbf{included} in the
result. So changing the value of this parameter will not change the
results but will alter the number of objects flagged in the output
file.

The CLIP parameter is clipping radius of the weight mask used in optimal
extraction. This is needed if optimal extraction is enabled and defaults
to 5 pixels. If optimal extraction is not enabled (using the X command)
then the CLIP parameter will not appear in the list when the options
command is issued.

The SEE parameter is a rough estimate of the seeing in the CCD image in
pixels. This is used by the optimal extraction algorithm for an initial
estimate of the FWHM of the point spread function (PSF) during fitting.
This parameter defaults to 2 pixels, and again if optimal extraction is not enabled then this parameter will not appear in the list when the options
command is issued.

\subsubsection{P --- photon statistics}

This is used to choose between the different ways in which the errors
are calculated. There are three possible choices selected by the integers
1 to 4 which have the following meanings :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Errors from photon statistics.
\item Errors from variations in the sky aperture.
\item Errors from data variance.
\item Gaussian errors from variations in the sky aperture.
\end{enumerate}
The first works out the errors from photon statistics in the sky and
signal apertures. This requires you to know and set-up the parameters
PADU and BIASLE which convert the data values to numbers of
photons. The message \st{Errors from photon statistics} will
signify that this has been chosen.

The second method of calculating the errors is from the measured
variance in the sky aperture. This method assumes that the measured
variance is due to photon statistics and scales the measurement in
the object aperture accordingly. This method still requires the
parameter PADU to be known, but does not need the BIASLE parameter to
be known. The message \st{Errors from sky variance} will signify that
this has been chosen. If neither the PADU or BIASLE parameters are
known, then it is best to use this method to indicate the reliability
of the measurements, but not to take the quoted error values as
absolute since this method will be wrong by a factor $\sqrt{PADU}$,
where $PADU$ is the unknown conversion factor.

The third method of calculating the errors is from the data errors
that are stored with the image (one per pixel). This method of
calculating the errors also requires the parameter PADU to be
known. The message \st{Errors from data variance} will signify that
this has been chosen. A variance component may not always be present
in data file along with the data array (indeed this can only be true
if you are storing your images in NDFs, see
\hyperref{here}{section \S}{}{dataformat}),
and if this is the case then PHOTOM
will issue the warning \st{Data does not have a variance component} if this
method is selected.

The fourth method of calculating the errors is like the second and uses the
measured variance in the sky aperture. This method assumes that the measured
variance is due to some gaussian source and doesn't require any knowledge of
the PADU and BIASLE values (which are unknown when dealing with data that has
been combined using a mean, say from a CCD Mosiac dithered on the sky), but
clearly this can only measure an upper limit as the actual noise in the
object will be (fractionally) less than in the sky. The best way to avoid
such uncertainty is by propagating data variances through all the stages that
produced the combined data and using method three.

\begin{latexonly}
Appendix \ref{errors} gives a full discussion of the calculation of
the errors assuming photon statistics.
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
A full discussion of the calculation of
the errors, assuming photon statistics, is given \htmlref{elsewhere}{errors}.
\end{htmlonly}

\subsubsection{S --- sky}

This is used to choose between the different methods of estimating the
background level in the sky aperture. There are four possible choices
selected by the integers 1 to 4 which have the following meanings :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simple mean.
\item Mean with 2 sigma rejection.
\item Mode.
\item A constant.
\end{enumerate}
The simple mean uses all the values in the sky aperture. The mean with
2 sigma rejection excludes all those points which are more than 2
standard deviations from the mean. Because one or more wayward
outliers can affect the size of the standard deviation, the mean and
standard deviation are recalculated after each stage of clipping up to
a maximum of three times.  The mode is superficially calculated from
the empirical relation
$mode = 3 * median - 2 * mean$, but because this can be fooled by
excessive skewness in the histogram there are rejection and averaging
schemes in the algorithm to ensure stability. The final option is to
supply a constant for the sky which is used for all
subsequent measurements. This value is used until either a new value is
chosen or one of the other methods of estimation is selected. The sky
variance is also requested so that if the errors are calculated from the
sky variance (command P) then a realistic error can be assigned. Both
the sky value and variance should be given in data units.

When using a concentric background aperture it is recommended that the
mode or mean with $2\sigma$ rejection is used as these offer protection
against contamination from other objects in the sky aperture.

For optimal extraction it is currently recommended that you use the modal
sky estimate.


\subsubsection{V --- values}

This summarizes the current settings of the significant parameters on
the terminal.

\subsubsection{X -- eXtraction}

This is a toggle switch which alters the way in which the photometry
is carried out. There are two methods available, aperture extraction is
the default.

\subsection{\xlabel{defaulted_parameters}Defaulted parameters}

A number of parameters can only be defined when the PHOTOM program
starts. They all have reasonable defaults, but if required can be
changed before running the program. The way to set a new value for one
of these is to use the keyword (the name by which the parameter is
always referred to) on the command line, as in :
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photom usemags=f resfile=flux.dat
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
This outputs the values in photon counts (i.e. as modified by the
BIASLE and PADU parameters) and writes the results of the analysis to
the file \texttt{flux.dat}.

\subsubsection{resfile}

This specifies the name of the results file which makes a permanent record
of the measurements.

\subsubsection{maxshift, maxiter, search and toler}

There are a number of parameters that control the centroiding algorithm.
SEARCH defines the size of the search box to be used in locating the
centroid in pixels. MAXITER defines the maximum number of iteration steps.
MAXSHIFT gives the maximum allowable shift in pixels between the initial,
rough, position and the calculated centroid. TOLER defines the position
accuracy in pixels that will terminate the centroiding iterations.

\subsubsection{exsource and etime}

These two parameters control how a value for the image exposure time
is determined. The exposure time is used to scale the results as in:
\begin{quote}
$mag = SKYMAG - 2.5 \log_{10} ( signal / exposure~time)$
\end{quote}
This affects the output values for the measured signal in the object
and the resultant magnitude or flux, but it does not change the
reported value for the sky in each pixel, or the error in the
measurement.

There are three methods for getting an exposure time:
\begin{enumerate}
\item supply a floating point value
\item supply the name of a FITS keyword (which must decode into a
  floating point value)
\item supply the name of an HDS object that exists somewhere in your
data file that can be decoded as a floating point value (this presumes
that you're storing your images in NDFs).
\end{enumerate}

So for instance if you've got an image with a FITS-type header and
the exposure time of the image is recorded in the record with name
\verb+EXPOSURE+, then you'd use a command like:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photom exsource=header etime=exposure
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
A simple floating point value (\verb+600+) is indicated by:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photom exsource=constant etime=600
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
An HDS object \verb+ext_time+ in the CCDPACK extension of an NDF is
indicated by:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photom exsource=hds etime=more.ccdpack.ext_time
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The structure of an NDF can be viewed using the HDSTRACE
(\xref{SUN/102}{sun102}{}) utility. The default exposure time is
\verb+1.0+.


\subsubsection{usemask}

This parameter is a logical flag which indicates whether a mask is to be
used when estimating the background. The purpose of the mask is to block
out contaminating objects from the background aperture. In this way bright
stars can be excluded from the estimation of the sky, which would
otherwise introduce contamination. Note that the sky estimators that
perform clipping of the pixel histogram, the mode and the mean with
$2\sigma$ rejection, also exclude contaminating pixels, but using the mask
along with the mean estimator allows this to be done in a controlled way.

If the USEMASK flag is TRUE then a file containing a list of positions is
requested (MASKFILE). The format of the file is the same as for inputting
a list of positions to measure (command F), namely an index number
followed by an x and y position. The given coordinates define the
centres of circles and any pixel with its centre within a circle will be
excluded from the sky estimation. The radius of the masking circle is
defined by another parameter (MASKRAD).

The mask only affects pixels in the background aperture, it does not
exclude any pixels from the measurement aperture. This means that
identical lists can be used to create the mask and to provide a source
for measurement. The output from an automatic object finding package
could be used in this way.

It is important not to confuse this mask with the point spread function
masks discussed as part of the optimal extraction algorithm.

Other ways of masking out pixels are to use the \xref{KAPPA}{sun95}{}
\latex{(SUN/95)} facilities \xref{ARDGEN}{sun95}{ARDGEN} and
\xref{ARDMASK}{sun95}{ARDMASK}, or the ARD and PATCH toolboxes
of the GAIA (\xref{SUN/214}{sun214}{}) image display tool.

\section{\xlabel{automated_photometry}Automated photometry}

PHOTOM provides two methods to perform the photometry of objects in a
non-interactive fashion. There are typically two reasons why you would
want to do this:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There are far too many objects on your images, so a statistical
      approach with some measurements in error is a necessity.
\item You just want to use PHOTOM as an engine for other interactive
      or script based tools.
\end{enumerate}
The second case is covered by the program
\htmlref{AUTOPHOTOM}{AUTOPHOTOM}, which is used by the photometry mode
in the \xref{GAIA}{sun214}{} (SUN/214) image display tool. The first
case by the \htmlref{PHOTOM}{PHOTOM} program in a special mode.

You can use PHOTOM in `batch' mode either interactively or by
controlling it from an ICL command procedure or from a C-shell script.
If you use a script of some kind then you'll also need another file
that contains the commands you would have used interactively.  It may be
necessary to run the program by hand first to verify the order of the
prompts. An example input file (\texttt{photom.in} say) could contain the
following commands:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
FRAME
N
5.0
0.0
0.0
F
POSITIONS.DAT
E
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
In this example the image data is assumed to be in a file \texttt{FRAME}
in the default directory. The size and shape of the aperture is set
using the non-interactive command, \texttt{N} and the command \texttt{F}
instructs the program to take the initial positions from the file
\texttt{POSITIONS.DAT}. The \texttt{E} command ends the program.

The program could then be run in the background with the command
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photom < photom.in > photom.out &
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Using \htmlref{AUTOPHOTOM}{AUTOPHOTOM} requires that a file with a
specified format is created, the details of which are described in
\hyperref{this appendix}{in appendix }{}{AUTOPHOTOM}.
Basically this
describes each aperture and also allows information about the sky
region associated with it to be given. The sky region can be defined
in a single annulus (each aperture can have a different inner and
outer scale) or can be defined as a series of other apertures. The
easiest way to create such a description of the apertures on an image
is to use the GAIA display tool. This description can then be run on
other frames non-interactively (say for different colours, or repeat
measurements).


\section{\xlabel{altering_program_parameters}Altering program parameters}

When a PHOTOM application is started, the initial selection of most of
the parameters is taken from the previous run of the routine. The
parameter values are stored in the \texttt{GLOBAL.sdf} or
\texttt{application\_name.sdf} files in the \texttt{$\sim$/adam} directory at the
end of a run. The current values can be examined using the
\xref{HDSTRACE}{sun102}{} facility \latex{(SUN/102)}. To clear these
values, and to revert to the start-up defaults the \texttt{GLOBAL.sdf}
and \texttt{application\_name.sdf} files have to be deleted.

The starting values of the parameters can also be specified within the
ADAM command language. The keyword facility allows the parameters to
be given on the command line (see \xref{SG/4}{sg4}{}, the ADAM User's
Manual). The keywords have the same name as the parameters; for
example the search box for the centroiding can be changed using the
command.
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ICL> photom search=5
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

From the C-shell the keywords can be included on the command line.
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photom search=5
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\section{\xlabel{using_different_image_formats}Using \xlabel{dataformat}different \label{dataformat}image formats}

Little has been said so far about the image data format that PHOTOM
programs will work with. The native format that these use is the
Starlink NDF (see \xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{what_is_an_ndf}). Files that
contain an NDF are identified by the extension \st{.sdf} and are
accessed by PHOTOM programs when you just give the filename without an
extension. So for instance if you have a file \st{image.sdf} that
contains an NDF then you just supply the response \st{image} when
prompted for an input image.

In addition to the NDF PHOTOM programs can also be made to use images
in other formats, such as disk FITS, old-style FIGARO and IRAF, using
the `on-the-fly' conversion abilities of the NDF library.
To make this work for you, you need to setup the CONVERT
(\xref{SUN/55}{sun55}{}) package and then pass images to PHOTOM
programs together with their file extensions. So if you wanted to work
on the IRAF image \st{pix.imh} you'd use a command sequence like:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% convert
% kappa
% xmake xwindows -overlay -ovcolour green
% display in=pix.imh device=xw
% photom in=pix.imh device=xov
... enter interactive command loop ...
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
In this case the file extension ``tells'' PHOTOM and the
\xref{KAPPA}{sun95}{} program \xref{DISPLAY}{sun95}{DISPLAY} that they
have an IRAF image. You should look at the CONVERT document (SUN/55)
to see the list of formats that can be processed.

   \sstdescription{
      PHOTOM performs photometry. It has two basic modes of operation;
      using an interactive display to specify the positions for the
      measurements, or obtaining those positions from a file. In both
      modes the user may perform photometry using either the traditional
      aperture method or using optimal extraction.

      During aperture photometry the aperture can either be circular
      or elliptical and the size and shape can be varied interactively
      on the display, or by entering values from the keyboard or parameter
      system. During optimal extraction the mask clipping radius can also
      be varied from the keyboard or via the parameter system. The
      background sky level can be sampled interactively by manual
      positioning of the aperture, or automatically from an annulus
      surrounding the object.

      PHOTOM is a menu driven application. The menu has been designed
      around single character entries, which hopefully have easily
      remembered mnemonics. Many of the options have counterparts in the
      parameter system, and so can be controlled outside the task by the

   index number (INTEGER), and the x and y positions (REAL) in that order.
   The index number is passed to the output to assist in identification of the
   objects.

   The output on the screen contains column headers to indicate the content of
   each column of the results. These column headers do not appear in the
   output file given by the RESFILE parameter in order that this file can be

   There are eleven columns in the output file containing the following
   information :

    10 \> ECCEN \> Eccentricity of aperture.\\
    11 \> ANGLE \> Orientation of aperture in degrees.\\
   \end{tabbing}

   The magnitude (MAG) is calculated from
      $mag = SKYMAG - 2.5 \log_{10} ( signal )$.

   The error in the magnitude (MAGERR) is estimated using one of the
   methods expounded in appendix \ref{errors} (note this error is not
   transformed into magnitudes when USEMAGS is FALSE).

   The error CODE can take on three possible values
   \begin{tabbing}
   xxxxxxx\=\kill
   B \> One or more pixels in the object aperture is bad.\\
   S \> One or more pixels in the object aperture is above the saturation level.\\
   E \> The object aperture intersects the edge of the data array.\\
   ? \> There are other problems with the measurement.
   \end{tabbing}

   If a bad pixel occurs in the object aperture then the pixel is not
   included in the calculation of the object signal. The bad pixel is not
   replaced by an estimate. If a saturated pixel occurs in the object
   aperture then it is included in the calculation of the object signal.
   If the aperture intersects the edge of the data array, the object signal
   is calculated for the reduced area of the aperture.

   Only one of these code letters is displayed, even if more than one of the
   conditions has occurred. The codes are in a increasing hierarchy 'B', 'S',
   'E', such that 'S' overrides 'B', and 'E' overrides 'S'.

\section{\xlabel{techniques_of_aperture_photometry}Techniques \xlabel{techniques}of \label{techniques}aperture photometry}

In principle aperture photometry of digitized data is a straightforward
procedure. Put down a computer generated aperture over the grid of data
and add up the counts within the aperture. In astronomical applications the
usual purpose of aperture photometry is to measure the brightness of an
object without including possible contributions from contaminating sources
such as bias levels, sky, defects or other stars and galaxies.
Some if not all of these contaminants will always be present in a finite
sized aperture and so this `background' has to be accounted for.
If it were possible the best place to estimate this background would be
behind the object, i.e. in the object aperture with the object not there.
As this is usually not possible to achieve, except for the case of moving
objects or supernovae, the usual method is to estimate the background
from other regions close to the object.

Estimating the contribution in this background is not always straightforward.
In the simplest case the histogram of pixel values in the background will
have an approximately Gaussian distribution, due to random fluctuations,
and the best estimator is a simple mean.
It is however common for real astronomical situations to be less
straightforward than this.
Other contributors are likely to be present, such as non-random noise,
bad pixels, cosmic rays, and the presence of other objects in the background.
Even when the possible contaminating objects are very faint compared to the
object to be measured the histogram of pixel values can be sufficiently
skewed to result in the mean giving an estimate of the sky too poor for high
precision photometry.
In this case it is usual to use some sort of clipping (or filtering) to
remove the effects of such contamination.

There are conflicting interests at work here. On the one hand it is
desirable to use a large background aperture to get good statistics, but
on the other hand this increases the probability of introducing extra
contamination or of sampling areas which are uncharacteristic of the
background near the object.

Of course if there is contamination in the background aperture then there
will almost certainly be some present in the object aperture. The effects
of this on the measurement depend on the density of objects and the ratio
of the sizes of the object and sky apertures. If the sky aperture is
larger than the object aperture and the objects are randomly distributed,
then there is a greater chance of having more contaminating objects in the
sky aperture than in the object aperture.
If the density of objects is large then the proportion in each aperture will
be similar, but when the number of objects is small then the chances of
the larger aperture being disproportionately endowed will increase. This
is best seen by considering the limiting case of one contaminating object
and its most probable location. In astronomical situations the smaller
populations tend to be the brighter objects and thus have an even greater
effect on the results.

An ideal filter would therefore include the many faint objects which
inhabit each aperture equally, but exclude the rare bright objects, which
are more likely to occur in the larger aperture. Unfortunately in reality
the spectra of densities and brightnesses are continuous and a clean
rejection scheme is difficult to construct.

The best scheme would seem to be to take many independent samples
using the same sized aperture as for the object. A new population is made
from the mean sky value in each aperture, and the peak of the histogram of
values, here called the mode, is used as the sky value. The mode is a
maximum likelihood estimator and this scheme ensures that the most likely
sky value averaged over the aperture size is used.
The problem in this case
is to get sufficient independent samples close to the object aperture and
therefore individual pixel values are usually used to construct the
sample population.

What these arguments are leading to is that there is no unique answer to
the question which is the best estimate for the sky; it depends on the
circumstances.
PHOTOM offers a choice of three estimators, a simple mean, a mean with
$2\sigma$ clipping and the mode.
When running jobs non-interactively it is best to use one of the estimators
that performs clipping: either the mode or the mean with $2\sigma$ rejection.
In the presence of positive contamination the mode will, in general,
provide the most rejection, the 2 sigma clipping the next and the mean
will provide no rejection. If the you suspect that one of the
estimators may be giving wrong results then try one of the
others.

\section{\xlabel{Explaining_optimal_photometry}Explaining \xlabel{explaining}\label{explaining}optimal photometry}

Optimal extraction offers serveral advantages over the normal aperture
method of photometry. Formally optimal extraction is equivalent to profile
fitting, however it offers more robust error estimation and a freedom of
the bias introduced by mis-estimating the point spread function (PSF). It has been found to offer a gain of around 10 per cent in signal-to-noise over normal aperture photometry.

A general formula for summing flux ($F$) within an aperture is

\[F=\sum_{i,j}W_{i,j}(D_{i,j}-S_{i,j}),\]

where sum is over all the pixels $i$,$j$ within the aperture, where the total
count in a pixel is $D_{i,j}$, the estimated sky level is $S_{i,j}$ and $W_{I,j}$ is the weight given to each pixel. For normal aperture photometry
this is one within the aperture, and zero outside it.

Finding the optimal value for $W_{I,j}$ for each $i$,$j$ within the aperture is a two step process. Firstly a model profile is fitted to a nearby star (a 2-D Gaussian has proved adequate for this purpose), the resulting estimated stellar proifle $P_{i,j}^{E}$ is normalised to one.

As shown by Horne (\htmladdnormallink{PASP, 1986, 98, 609}{http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986PASP...98..609H&db_key=AST&nosetcookie=1&high=375ea70ad608221}) once the estimated profile is known the best signal-to-noise is obtained for

\[W_{i,j}=\frac{P_{i,j}^{E}/V_{i,j}}{\sum_{i,j}(P_{i,j}^{E})^2/V_{i,j}},\]

where $V_{i,j}$ is the variance for each pixel. Substituting this into our
first equation we obtain the basic formula governing optimal extraction. However at this stage we make a further assumption, that the variance for each pixel is the same. For very faint stars this is clearly the case (since the counts in each pixel is dominated by the sky count), for brighter stars though this means that the extraction will be non-optimal. Hence we have that

\[F=\frac{\sum_{i,j}P_{i,j}^{E}(D_{i,j}-S_{i,j})}{\sum_{i,j}(P_{i,j}^{E})^2}.\]

From this we note that if the PSF is wrong there will be no systematic bias in the results, provided one is interested in the relative brightness of one star with respect to another in the same frame.

A full treatment of optimal extarction can be found in Tim Naylor's MNRAS paper
``An optimal extraction algorithm for imaging photometry'' (\htmladdnormallink{MNRAS, 1998, 296, 339}{http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998MNRAS.296..339N&db_key=AST\&{}high=365efe227210385}) to which the reader is directed for further information.

\section{\xlabel{calculation_of_the_errors}Calculation \xlabel{errors}of \label{errors}the errors}

The errors are calculated in one of four ways, as discussed in the section
on command P. The first method assumes true photon statistics and the
error is calculated from the following definitions:

\begin{quote}
Number of pixels in object aperture  $= a_o$\\
Number of pixels in sky aperture     $= a_s$\\
Sum of data in object aperture       $= D_o$\\
Sum of data in sky aperture          $= D_s$\\
Offset in one pixel                  $= BIASLE$\\
Number of photons per data unit      $= PADU$
\end{quote}

The contribution of the sky in the object aperture can now be calculated:

\begin{quote}
Number of photons in object aperture $= P_o = PADU * ( D_o - a_o * BIASLE )$\\
Number of photons in sky aperture    $= P_s = PADU * ( D_s - a_s * BIASLE )$\\
Number of photons in object aperture due to sky
$= P_{so} = PADU * ( D_s - a_s * BIASLE ) * ( a_o / a_s )$
\end{quote}

The signal due to the object is the difference of the total number of
photons in the object aperture minus the number due to the sky:

\begin{quote}
Object signal $= S_o = P_o - P_{so} = PADU * ( D_o - D_s * ( a_o / a_s ) )$
\end{quote}

The error on the object signal is the quadratic sum of the errors on the
individual measurements. Using $\varepsilon$ to signify the error:

\[\varepsilon( S_o )^2 \sim \varepsilon( D_o )^2 + \varepsilon( D_s )^2 *
( a_o / a_s )^2\]

Assuming the errors are solely from photon statistics then the error on
the signal is:

\[\varepsilon( S_o )^2 = \varepsilon( P_o )^2 + \varepsilon( P_s )^2 *
( a_o / a_s )^2\]

The error from photon counting is the square root of the number of photons:

\begin{center}
$\varepsilon( P_o ) = \sqrt{ P_o }$ and $\varepsilon( P_s ) = \sqrt{ P_s }$
\end{center}

Therefore:
\begin{equation}\underline{
\varepsilon( S_o )^2 = P_o + P_s * ( a_o^2 / a_s^2 )
                      = PADU * ( D_o + D_s *( a_o^2 / a_s^2 ) -
                        BIASLE * a_o ( 1 + a_o / a_s ) )}\end{equation}


The second method of calculating the errors assumes that the variance in
the sky aperture corresponds to the photon noise. This allows the photon
errors to be calculated without knowing BIASLE. One additional definition
has to be given:

\begin{quote}
Standard deviation in sky aperture per pixel in data units $=\sigma_s$
\end{quote}

If the photon error $\sqrt{P_s}$ is equated to the standard deviation
$PADU * \sigma_s$ then the total number of photons in the sky aperture is
given by:

\[P_s = a_s * PADU^2 * \sigma_s^2\]

The offset in the sky aperture can now be calculated:
\[BIASLE = ( D_s / a_s ) - ( PADU * \sigma_s^2 )\]

Substituting this into the calculation of the error gives:
\[\varepsilon( S_o )^2 = PADU * ( D_o - D_s * ( a_o / a_s ) +
                         PADU * \sigma_s^2 * a_o * ( 1 + a_o / a_s ) )\]

or
\begin{equation}\underline{
\varepsilon( S_o )^2 = S_o + PADU^2 * \sigma_s^2 * a_o * ( 1 + a_o / a_s ) )
}\end{equation}

The third method of calculating the errors sums the data variances from
the variance component of an NDF. Two additional definitions
have to be given:

\begin{quote}
Sum of variance in object aperture       $= V_o$\\
Sum of variance in sky aperture          $= V_s$
\end{quote}

The error is then calculated from:
\begin{equation}\underline{
\varepsilon( S_o )^2 = PADU^2 * ( V_o + V_s * ( a_o / a_s )^2 )
}\end{equation}

The magnitude error is calculated from differentiating the magnitude equation:
\[m=-2.5\log_{10}S_o\]

thus:
\[\underline{dm=\frac{-2.5}{\ln10}*\frac{\varepsilon(S_o)}{S_o}}\]

The fourth method is like method two, but the sky variations are
interpreted by a gaussian error source, so PADU and BIASLE are not
required. With guassian errors the source signal is effectively zero
(since it has the same noise per pixel as the sky), so
\begin{equation}\underline{
\varepsilon( S_o ) = PADU * \sigma_s * \sqrt( a_o )
}\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\underline{
S_o = PADU * ( D_o - D_s * ( a_o / a_s ) )
}\end{equation}
so the PADUs cancel out in the $dm$ calculation.


\section{PHOTOPT \xlabel{PHOTOPT}- examining PHOTOM's performance}

PHOTOPT is an auxiliary package to examine the performance of the various
sky estimators used by PHOTOM. As indicated in section \ref{techniques} the
best choice of estimator depends on the circumstances.
The idea behind PHOTOPT is to put down an aperture on a random piece of sky,
estimate the background from a concentric aperture using one of the sky
estimators offered by PHOTOM, and subtract this estimated sky from the
flux in the central aperture. If the sky estimator correctly estimates
the sky then the difference of the two will be zero. Since an automatic
procedure cannot be certain of selecting a representative piece of sky,
the procedure is repeated a number of times to increase the statistics.

PHOTOPT selects regularly spaced points within an image, puts down an
aperture at each of the points and calculates the difference between
the central aperture and the sky estimate from the surrounding annulus.
Each of the three sky estimators offered by PHOTOM are tried in turn on
the same set of points so that a comparison can be made between the three
methods. The output is in the form of two graphs for each estimator. The
first shows the difference between the central aperture and the sky
estimator for each of the samples. The sample number forms the x-axis
and the difference (object - sky) given in photons per pixel forms
the y-axis. The second plot shows a histogram of the differences for
the samples. The differences are binned into suitable intervals and form
the x-axis of the histogram, with the y-axis giving the number of samples
in each difference bin.

PHOTOPT has a number of parameters in common with PHOTOM: the aperture
shape parameters, SEMIM, ECCEN and ANGLE, the scaling factors PADU and
SATURE and the background annulus size INNER and OUTER. The two
parameters unique to PHOTOPT are NP, the number of points to sample, up
to a maximum of 100, and the RANGE, which defines the bounds of the
data value used in the plot. The number of points sampled may not exactly
equal the number requested as the program automatically positions the
points to be on a rectangular grid which evenly covers the whole data array.
The program also ensures that the density of points does not result in
the central apertures overlapping.

PHOTOPT can be run from ICL or the C-shell. From ICL use :
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ICL> photopt
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
From the C-shell use (assuming photomstart has been executed) :
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% photopt
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
