1 Update_to_PHOTOM

  PHOTOM is described in SUN/45, which you can view with the command 
  "showme sun45". The support programmer can be reached my emailing
  photom@star.rl.ac.uk

  Major Changes
  -------------
   v 1.10
    A new aperture photometry error estimator has been added. This
    uses the variance in the sky regions to estimate a gaussian noise
    for the object measurement. This does not require that the PADU and 
    BIASLE values are known (which can be difficult to estimate for combined
    data that do not have data variances), but is not a proper value and can 
    only give guidance for an upper limit on the error.
   
    v 1.9
    PSF algorithim changes, algorithim should be more robust.

    v 1.8
    The option to use the optimal extraction algorithim has been added
    to both PHOTOM and AUTOPHOTOM. The additional parameters OPTIMA,
    CLIP and SEE have been added to support this facility.

       9th February 1999  
  
    v 1.7
    The PHOTOM application AUTOPHOTOM has been extended so that
    annular sky regions may also be defined in pixels (in addition 
    to the existing method of two scale factors).

  Bug Fixes 
  ---------
    Since v1.10
    -----------

    A memory fault in the optimal photometry code when stars where close to
    the edges of the image has been fixed. Various initialisation issues have
    also been fixed.
  
    AUTOASTROM: extended error messages when parsing bad input catalogues
    have been added (previously unspecific error reports where made).
  
    Since v1.9
    ----------

    Problem with PSF star centroiding resolved.

    Increased robustness of centroiding algorithim for extreme cases.

    Bug in handling position files with PHOTOM under optimal extraction
    resolved.

    Fixed some GIRD/PIXEL co-ordianate inconsistences when reporting the
    final fitted $X,Y$ co-ordinatles.

    Since v 1.8
    -----------

    Fixed a bug which meant that the error in the flux was not corrected
    for the exposure time, although the flux itself had been.
   
    Fixed bug where the error code for a PSF star was returned incorrectly. 
    Added functionality to handle bad pixels inside the PSF mask.

    Fixed photom_init problem which caused some previously written 
    scripts to fail for v1.8

    Fixed AUTOPHOTOM bug, sky value now initalised to zero.   

    Fixed bug which caused a fatal IO error during PSF fitting in a 
    (very) limited range of cases.
       
    A bug in the error estimation routine for optimal extraction
    was found and fixed

      30th December 2000
 
    Since v 1.7
    -----------

    A harmless FIO__EOF message, which appeared in PHOTOM's automatic
    mode has been stopped.
