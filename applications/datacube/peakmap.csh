#  Name:
#     peakmap.csh
#
#  Purpose:
#     Builds a map of emission-line strength from a spectral-cube NDF.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     C-shell script.
#
#  Usage:
#     peakmap [-a] [-c number] [-ci index] [-f] [-i filename] [-l logfile] 
#             [-o filename] [-p] [-v] [-z/+z]
#
#  Description:
#     This shell script reads a three-dimensional spectral-cube NDF and 
#     presents you with a white-light image of the cube.  You can then select
#     an X-Y position using the cursor.  The script will extract and display
#     this reference spectrum.  You will then be prompted to specify various
#     fitting parameters, such as the peak position, using the cursor.  The
#     script will then attempt to fit the emission line.  The fit will be 
#     displayed and you are consulted regarding the goodness of fit.  If you
#     consider the fit to be good enough, the script will attempt to perform
#     similar fits to all spectra within the cube, building a two-dimensional
#     NDF image of the strength of the line.  These will use the same initial
#     parameters as the reference spectrum, unless option -a is selected.
#     You may view this image drawn with a key (option -d), and overlay a 
#     contour plot (with a key) of the white-light image (option -c).
#
#     If you do not force the fit to be considered "good" by using the -f
#     command-line option, the script will offer the opportunity to manually
#     refit the spectral feature for individual pixels, such as those that
#     were unsuccessfully fitted by the automatic procedure.  In this case,
#     the line-strength map will be plotted and replotted after the new fit, 
#     regardless of the -p option.
#
#  Parameters:
#     -a
#       Requests that each fit may be inspected then approved or re-fit, not 
#       just the initial reference fit.  A re-fit will change the initial 
#       parameter guesses for subsequent fits, so it is recommended that you 
#       note the co-ordinates of spectra to re-fit and tackle these
#       individually in the final manual re-fit stage.  [FALSE]
#     -c number
#       Number of contours in the white-light image.  Set to fewer
#       than 1 means no contours are overlaid.  [15]
#     -ci index
#       The palette colour index of the contours.  It should be an
#       integer in the range 0 to 15.  It is best to choose an index
#       corresponding to white, or black or another dark colour to make
#       the contours stand out from other elements of the plot.  0 is
#       the background colour.  KAPPA:GDSTATE will list the current
#       palette colours.  [0]
#     -f
#       Force the script to accept the first attempt to fit a Gaussian to
#       the line.  This is a dangerous option; if the fit is poor, or
#       unobtainable the script may terminate abruptly if it is forced to
#       accept the fit.  This will additionally suppress manual re-fitting 
#       of bad pixels at the end of the run of the script.  [FALSE]
#     -i filename
#       The script will use this as its input file, the specified file should
#       be a three-dimensional NDF.  By default the script will prompt for the
#       input file.
#     -l filename
#       The name of an text log file containing the fitted Gaussian 
#       coefficients for each spatial pixel.  The file is written as a
#       Starlink Small Text List (STL) described in SUN/190.  The STL file 
#       comprises a schema to locate and describe the columns, and store 
#       global properties; and a formatted table of the coefficients.  The 
#       schema includes the units and a brief description of each column, and 
#       the name of the input NDF used.  The table lists the Gaussian centre, 
#       peak height the FWHM, and integrated flux, each with its fitting error.
#     -o filename
#       The filename for the output NDF of the line-strength map.
#     -p
#       The script will plot the final image map to the current display 
#       as well as saving it to an NDF file.  It will additionally overplot
#       the white-light image as a contour map for comparison.  [FALSE]
#     -v
#       The script will generate a variance array from the line fits and
#       attach it to the peak-intensity-map NDF. [FALSE]
#     -z 
#       The script will automatically prompt to select a region to zoom
#       before prompting for the region of interest.  [TRUE]
#     +z 
#       The script will not prompt for a zoom before requesting the region
#       of interest.  [FALSE]
#
#  Notes:
#     -  The line-strength image map display scales between the 15 and 98 
#     percentiles.  The map uses a false-colour lookup table. 
#     -  CURSA:CATCOPY may be used to convert the STL log file (see the -l 
#     option) to FITS format for analysis with the likes of TOPCAT, provided 
#     the STL has the ".txt" file extension.  If you want just the tabulated
#     data for your own favourite tool, the schema can be easily removed 
#     manually, or with sed excluding the lines up to and including the line
#     beginning "BEGINTABLE".
#
#  Implementation Status:
#     This script invokes a collection of A-tasks from the KAPPA and
#     Figaro packages.

#       Changed input method of inputing the continuum measurement.
#     10-NOV-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Added bad fit check, modified plot colour for contour lines.
#     12-NOV-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Modified to work under Solaris 5.8, problems with bc and csh.
#     20-NOV-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Incorporated changes made to source at ADASS.
#     23-NOV-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Added lots of command line options.
#       Added interrupt handling.
#     31-DEC-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Allowed single-character responses to yes/no prompts.
#     03-JAN-2001 (AALLAN)
#       Added manual refitting of data points.
#     08-JAN-2001 (AALLAN):
#       Variance calculation made more robust.
#       Fixed bug in magic-value propogation.
#       Major bug in manual refitting routine fixed.
#     18-OCT-2001 (AALLAN):
#       Modified temporary files to use ${tmpdir}/${user}.
#     2005 September 1 (MJC):
#       Replaced COPYAXIS with KAPPA:SETAXIS.
#     2005 September 2 (MJC):
#       Replaced PUTAXIS with KAPPA:SETAXIS in WCS mode.  Some tidying:
#       remove tabs, spelling corrections.  Added section headings in the
#       code.  Replace explicit wavelength in prompts with the current WCS
#       Frame's label for the spectral axis, and also used the corresponding
#       units in the output commentary.  Avoid :r.
#     2005 October 11 (MJC):
#       Replaced unused -r with -c option, and all prompts pertaining
#       to obtaining a rest value.  Described the option to refit spectral
#       line for individual spatial pixel.  Fixed bugs converting the cursor
#       position into negative pixel indices.  Ensured that the plots of
#       spectra use the axis co-ordinate system.  Called KAPPA:CALC for
#       floating-point arithmetic using appriopriate precision, and ensure a
#       digit before a decimal point, unlike bc.  Plot spectra in histogram
#       mode for clarity.  Added defaults to parameter descriptions.
#       Appended data unit to reported peak values, or replace spurious fixed
#       "ms^-1".  Inserted blank lines to structure the commentary better.
#       Correct some output and comments: e.g. "spectra" singular to
#       "spectrum".
#     2005 November 3 (MJC):
#       Add options waste disposal.
#     2006 March 2 (MJC):
#       Allow for NDF sections to be supplied with the input filename.
#       Use a new script to obtain cursor positions.
#     2006 March 9 (MJC):
#       Corrected the NDF name extraction when both the file extension and 
#       an NDF section are supplied; this is via the new checkndf script that
#       also checks for a degenerate third axis.
#     2006 March 16 (MJC):
#       Use any supplied spectral-axis section when ripping each spectrum for 
#       line fitting.  Reset KAPPA:DISPLAY parameters.
#     2007 May 5 (MJC):
#       Obtain and use spectral units.  Call the new getfitcon script to
#       determine the fit's initial-guess parameters.  Added -c option.
#     2007 May 8 (MJC):
#       Added -l option.
#     2008 June 19 (MJC):
#       Intepret non-positive number of contours to mean no contour
#       overlay required.  Added -ci option.  Provide case insensitive 
#       prompting.  Remove overloading of the fitgood variable.  Fixed bug 
#       that stored the peak-height error as the variance in the output NDF.
#       Remove duplicate token.  Added Licence.
#     2008 June 25 (MJC):
#       Added STL schema for log of fit parameters.
