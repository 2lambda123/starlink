#  Name:
#     velmoment.csh
#
#  Purpose:
#     Builds a velocity map from a three-dimensional IFU NDF from the
#     intensity-weighted spectral co-ordinates.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     C-shell script.
#
#  Usage:
#     velmoment [-b string] [-c number] [-ci index] [-i filename] 
#               [-o filename] [-p] [-r number] [-s system] [-z/+z] 
#
#  Description:
#     This shell script processes a three-dimensional IFU NDF to form
#     a velocity map.  
#
#     If you request zooming the script first presents you with a 
#     white-light image of the cube.  You can then select the lower 
#     and upper spatial limits to plot using the cursor.  You can
#     instead supply an NDF section with the filename to define both 
#     spatial and spectral limits to analyse, and from which to create
#     the output velocity map.  You may average spectra in the chosen
#     region by specifying compression factors in the spatial domain.

#     The script then derives the intensity weighted co-ordinate of
#     each spatially averaged spectrum, and converts the data units 
#     into a velocity.  You may view this image drawn with a key 
#     (option -d), and overlay a contour plot of the white-light image
#     (option -c).
#
#  Parameters:
#     -b string
#       The number of spectra to block average along the x and y axes
#       respectively.  This should be a comma-separated list or a single
#       number; the latter case applies the same compression factor to
#       both spatial axes.  The numbers must be positive integers.  [1]
#     -c number
#       Number of contours in the white-light image.  Set to fewer
#       than 1 means no contours are overlaid.  [15]
#     -ci index
#       The palette colour index of the contours.  It should be an 
#       integer in the range 0 to 15.  It is best to choose an index
#       corresponding to white, or black or another dark colour to make
#       the contours stand out from other elements of the plot.  0 is
#       the background colour.  KAPPA:GDSTATE will list the current
#       palette colours.  [0]
#     -i filename
#       The script will use this as its input file, the specified file 
#       should be a three-dimensional NDF.  By default the script will 
#       prompt for the input file.  If there are multiple spectral lines
#       present, you should supply an NDF section after the name to
#       restrict the spectral range analysed to a specific line and 
#       its environs.
#     -o filename
#       The filename for the output NDF of the velocity map.
#     -p
#       The script will plot the final image map to the current display 
#       as well as saving it to an NDF file.  Additionally it will over-
#       plot the white-light image as a contour map for comparison.  [FALSE]
#     -r number
#       Rest-frame spectral unit of the line being fitted.
#     -s system
#       The co-ordinate system for velocities.  Allowed values are:
#          "VRAD" -- radio velocity;
#          "VOPT" -- optical velocity;
#          "ZOPT" -- redshift; and
#          "VELO" -- relativistic velocity.
#       If you supply any other value, the default is used.  ["VOPT"]
#     -z 
#       The script will automatically prompt to select a region to zoom
#       before prompting for the region of interest.  [TRUE]
#     +z 
#       The program will not prompt for a zoom before requesting the region
#       of interest. [FALSE]
#
#  Notes:
#     -  The compression is trimmed, so that only compression-factor
#     multiples of original pixels are included in the plot. 
#     -  The spatial averaging is aligned to obtain the expected number
#     of pixels irrespective of the pixel origin of the input cube.
#     Note that this may not be suitable if you wish to preserve alignment
#     with another compressed dataset.  See KAPPA:COMPAVE parameter ALIGN 
#     for more details.
#     -  The velocity map display scales between the 2 and 98 percentiles.
#     The map uses a false-colour spectrum-like colour table so that
#     low-velocity regions appear in blue and high-velocity regions 
#     appear in red.
#     -  If the cube is compressed spatially, so is the contour map.
#     -  For NDFs in the UK data-cube format, where there is no SPECTRUM
#     or DSBSPECTRUM Domain in the WCS Frames, the data are first 
#     collapsed in their native wavelengths in Angstrom, then the pixel 
#     values are converted to VOPT using the simple formula 
#     c * (w -R) / R, where w is the intensity-weighted wavelength, R is 
#     the rest-frame wavelength for the chosen spectral line, and c is the
#     velocity of light in km/s.
#
#  Implementation Status:
#     This script invokes a collection of A-tasks from the KAPPA package.

#  History:
#     2006 March 6 (MJC):
#       Original version.
#     2006 March 9 (MJC):
#       Added -ci option.  Corrected the NDF name extraction when both
#       the file extension and an NDF section are supplied; this is via 
#       the new checkndf script that also checks for a degenerate third
#       axis.
#     2006 March 16 (MJC):
#       Formed VOPT velocities for UK data-cube format NDFs that do
#       not have a SpecFrame.  Collapsed the spatially averaged cube
#       for the contour plot so that its co-ordinate system matches
#       the velocity map.  Retain any supplied spectral-axis section
#       if a spatial region is selected by cursor.  Corrected the logic
#       when deciding whether or not to create a new SpecFrame.
