1 DATACUBE_Version_1.1

  A new release of DATACUBE (v1.1) has been made.  Further
  details can be found in SUN/237.  This can be viewed with 
  the commands "showme sun237".  The main changes are:

2 New_Commands

The following new scripts have been added:

   o gridspec
     Averages groups of spatially neighbouring spectra of a 
     three-dimensional IFU NDF and then plots these averaged spectra
     in a grid.
   o velmoment
     Builds a velocity map from the collapsed intensity-weighted 
     spectral co-ordinates.  It supports spatial compression.

2 Modified_Commands
The following applications have been modified:

   o  compare has a -i option for input filename for non-interactive
      scripting.

   o  multistack and stacker plot ordinate limits now always
   make visible all the spectra, regardless of the chosen offset.

   o  peakmap now has -c option to specify the number of contour 
   levels to plot; this may be zero to prevent contours be overlaid. 

   o  passband  does not dump WCS mappings in NDFCOPY.  Ensured that 
   the plots of spectra use the axis co-ordinate system.  Removed 
   unused -r option.

   o  step now plots the image slices in an optimally shaped grid
   rather than full size in quick succession, and thereby permits
   comparison of the slices. 

   o  velmap generalised the transformation of the measured line 
   displacements from the rest-frame co-ordinate in the current 
   spectral system into one of four velocity measurements using
   WCSTRAN.  Added a SpecFrame to achieve this functionality for
   UK data-cube files.

   Added the -s option to define the co-ordinate system of the
   derived velocities.  Ensured that the plots of spectra use the 
   axis co-ordinate system.  The script inquires the WCS for the 
   rest-frame frequency to avoid unnecessary prompting.

   Changed lower percentile for display from 15 to 2.  Use spectrum
   colour table.  Added a velocity key.

   Additional -c option to specify the number of contours; this may
   be zero to prevent contours be overlaid.  Added -ci option to
   specify the colour index of contours.

2 General_changes

   o  The package applications COPYAXIS, GETBOUND, and PUTAXIS have
   been withdrawn.  The scripts that invoked these now call 
   KAPPA:SETAXIS, NDFTRACE, and SETAXIS respectively.

   o  The scripts have been generalised to spectral co-ordinate systems
   other than Wavelength in Angstrom.  Units are reported too.

   o  A bug displacing by +1 pixel negative pixel indices determined
   by the cursor has been fixed.  It was present in most of the 
   scripts.

   o  Spectrum plots now use the histogram style for greater clarity.

   o  Reset KAPPA:DISPLAY parameters in a few scripts, so that 
   features enabled in other scripts, like a key, do not bleed 
   through.

   o  Tidied the scripts.  Changes included the silent removal and
   creation of files, alphabetical ordering of the options, 
   documentation of default values of options, corrections to grammar 
   and punctuation, avoidance of :r, and aligned output.

   o  Accepts .sdf extension and/or allows NDF sections to be supplied.
