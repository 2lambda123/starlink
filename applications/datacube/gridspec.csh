#  Name:
#     gridspec.csh
#
#  Purpose:
#     Averages groups of neighbouring spectra of a three-dimensional IFU
#     NDF and then plots these averaged spectra in a grid.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     C-shell script.
#
#  Usage:
#     gridspec [-b string] [-i filename] [-z/+z] 
#
#  Description:
#     This shell script reads a three-dimensional IFU NDF as input and
#     if you request zooming the script presents you with a white-light
#     image of the cube.   You can then select the lower and upper 
#     spatial limits to plot using the cursor.  You can instead supply 
#     an NDF section with the filename to define both spatial and 
#     spectral limits to plot.
#
#     The script averages spectra in the chosen region by specified 
#     compression factors in the spatial domain.  It then displays the 
#     average spectra in a grid, where the exterior axes indicate the
#     spatial co-ordinates of the averaged spectra, and the interior axes
#     the data values against spectra co-ordinates.
#
#  Parameters:
#     -b string
#       The number of spectra to block average along the x and y axes
#       respectively.  This should be a comma-separated list or a single
#       number; the latter case applies the same compression factor to
#       both spatial axes.  The numbers must be positive integers.  [2]
#     -i filename
#       The script will use this as its input file, the specified file should
#       be a three-dimensional NDF.  By default the script will prompt for the
#       input file.
#     -z 
#       The script will automatically prompt to select a region to zoom
#       before prompting for the region of interest.  [TRUE]
#     +z 
#       The program will not prompt for a zoom before requesting the region
#       of interest. [FALSE]
#
#  Notes:
#     -  The compression is trimmed, so that only compression-factor
#     multiples of original pixels are included in the plot.  There
#     -  The spatial averaging is aligned to obtain the expected number
#     of pixels irrespective of the pixel origin of the input cube.
#     Note that this may not be suitable if you wish to preserve alignment
#     with another compressed dataset.  See KAPPA:COMPAVE parameter ALIGN 
#     for more details.
#
#  Implementation Status:
#     This script invokes a collection of A-tasks from the KAPPA package.

#  History:
#     2006 March 1 (MJC):
#       Original version.
#     2006 March 2 (MJC):
#       Use a new script to obtain cursor positions.
#     2006 March 9 (MJC):
#       Corrected the NDF name extraction when both the file extension and 
#       an NDF section are supplied; this is via the new checkndf script that
#       also checks for a degenerate third axis.
#     2006 March 16 (MJC):
#       Retain any supplied spectral axis section if a spatial region is
#       selected by cursor.
