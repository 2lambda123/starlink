#  Name:
#     step.csh
#
#  Purpose:
#     Steps through the each X-Y plane of a three-dimensional IFU NDF
#     in the spectral direction using KAPPA:DISPLAY to display the output.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     C-shell script.
#
#  Usage:
#     step [-i filename] [-l number] [-p] [-s number] [-u number] 
#
#  Description:
#     This shell script reads a three-dimensional IFU NDF as input and
#     allows you to step through the datacube in the spectral direction
#     in slices.  The output goes to files and (optionally) to the screen.
#
#  Parameters:
#     -i filename
#       The script will use this as its input file, the specified file should
#       be a three-dimensional NDF.  By default the script will prompt for the
#       input file.
#     -l number
#       Lower spectral-axis bound of the region of interest.
#     -p 
#       The script will plot the extracted images to the current display 
#       as well as saving it to an NDF file. [FALSE]
#     -s number
#       Spectral-axis step size for each passband chunk.
#     -u number
#       Upper spectral-axis bound of the region of interest.  
#
#  Implementation Status:
#     This script invokes a collection of A-tasks from the KAPPA package.

#  History:
#     05-SEP-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Original version.
#     06-SEP-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Modified to use GETBOUND A-Task
#     06-SEP-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Modified to use PUTAXIS A-Task
#     20-SEP-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Shifted some floating point calculation to use the CALC A-task
#     20-NOV-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Incorporated changes made to source at ADASS
#     21-NOV-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Moved image display to end of script.
#     23-NOV-2000 (AALLAN):
#       Added interrupt handler.
#       Added -i, -l, -u and -s command line options.
#     18-OCT-2001 (AALLAN):
#       Modified temporary files to use ${tmpdir}/${user}
#     2005 September  1 (MJC):
#       Replaced GETBOUND with NDFTRACE, accessing frame-bound
#       parameters FLBND/FUBND.
#     2005 September  2 (MJC):
#       Replaced PUTAXIS with KAPPA:SETAXIS in WCS mode.  Some tidying:
#       spelling & punctuation corrections, sorted parameters in 
#       alphabetical order.  Added section headings in the code.  Replace
#       explicit wavelength in prompts with the current WCS Frame's label for
#       the spectral axis, and also used the corresponding units in the 
#       output commentary.
#     2005 November 3 (MJC):
#       Plot the image slices in an optimally shaped grid rather than
#       full size in quick succession, and thereby permit comparison.  
#       Surmised the units for a UK data-cube format NDF.  Add options
#       waste disposal.
#     2006 March 2 (MJC):
#       Allow for NDF sections to be supplied with the input filename.
#     2006 March 9 (MJC):
#       Corrected the NDF name extraction when both the file extension and 
#       an NDF section are supplied; this is via the new checkndf script that
#       also checks for a degenerate third axis.
