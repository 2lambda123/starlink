#  Name:
#     make_fitgauss_table.csh
#
#  Purpose:
#     Creates an STL file for recording spectral-cube Gaussian-fitting results.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     C-shell script.
#
#  Usage:
#     make_fitgauss_table.csh [-c units] [-f filename] -l logfile [-v units]
#
# Description:
#    This primitive creates a Starlink small text-file (STL) catalogue.
#    It contains the scxhema for the tabulated data made by FITGAUSS
#    invocations in the DATACUBE package, such as in scripts peakmap and 
#    velmap.  In addition to the regular headers there is a formatted
#    comment line immediately before the BEGINTABLE presenting the column
#    headings.  The co-ordinate and value units, if supplied, are recorded 
#    in the header in each relevant field.  The name of the cube being
#    analysed, if supplied, is recorded as a parameter of the table.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The format for output values is 
#    %6i %6i %12.5g %12.5g %12.5g %12.5g %12.5g %12.5g %12.5g %12.5g
#    representing the followingf parameters; X abnd Y pixel indices,
#    centre and its error, peak height and its error, FWHM and its error,
#    and the intgral flux and its error respectively.
#
#  Parameters:
#     -c units
#       The units of the spectral co-ordinates used for the centre and FWHM 
#       fields, and  their respective errors.  If not supplied, the UNITS 
#       field of the schema will be not written for these fields.
#     -f filename
#       The name of the NDF being analysed.
#     -l filename
#       The name of the log file to contain the table of fit parameters.
#     -v units
#       The data value units used for the peak height and flux fields, and 
#       their respective errors.  If not supplied, the UNITS field of the
#       table schema will be not written for these fields.
