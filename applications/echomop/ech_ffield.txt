|  Flat field: ech_ffield/echmenu option 5
|  ---------------------------------------
|
|  The next step in the default sequence is to model the flat-field
|  frame to derive per-pixel balance factors.  These factors, which
|  have close-to-unity values, are multiplied into the object-frame
|  pixels to normalise their values with respect to their near
|  neighbours.  This process only corrects for `local' effects at
|  the pixel scale.  Removing the `blaze' function is a separate task
|  (ech_blaze/option 11) which is performed on the extracted orders.
|
|  The program determines the mean flat-field behaviour in both the
|  spatial and (optionally) the wavelength directions.  Per-pixel
|  balance factors are then found by reference to the fitted values.
|  The derived balance factors are used during the extraction by
|  multiplying each object-frame pixel by its balance factor.
|
|  Interactive flat-field modelling is also available; this permits
|  user-control of the fit functions, order of fit and so on.
|  Interctive fitting is enabled by setting TUNE_FFINTERACT=YES.
