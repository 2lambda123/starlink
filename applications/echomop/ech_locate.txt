|  Frame checking & order location: ech_locate/echmenu option 1
|  ------------------------------------------------------------
|
|  A substantial menu of items has now been displayed.
|  Fortunately the task attempts to be as helpful as possible
|  in guiding the user through the selections.  As this is
|  the beginning of a new reduction, the suggested menu option
|  is Option 1 - Start a reduction.  The program offers this
|  as a default, which can be accepted by simply typing Y<return>.
|
|  NOTE: The demonstration drives the package and provides
|  all the its input directly, you cannot respond to the prompts
|  yourself.
|
|  When Option 1 runs it prompts for the names of two data
|  frames: the frame to be used to trace the paths of the orders
|  across the frame, and the object frame from which to extract the
|  spectrum.  The use of either a bright `star' data frame, or a
|  flat-field frame (through a narrow dekker), for order tracing is
|  recommended.
|
|  The task then checks the two data frames to ensure that they
|  have consistent X and Y dimensions.  It may optionally check for
|  saturated pixels, bad rows/columns, and cosmic rays in the trace
|  frame, these features being enabled via the use of tuning
|  parameters.
|
|  The task then proceeds to estimate the slope of the orders and
|  their positions (in Y) at the central column of the frame.
