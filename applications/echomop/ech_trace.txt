|  Order validation: ech_ordloc/echmenu option 1.1
|  -----------------------------------------------
|
|  The program has now produced a graph of the variation of intensity
|  up the central column of the trace frame. It also indicates where
|  it has located any orders. The user normally has the opportunity to
|  correct any bad identifications by using the graphics cursor
|  and the commands  A (to add an order), D (to delete an order).
|
|  Once the displayed order positions are validated, then typing
|  E will cause the program to accept them. (For situations where
|  the user is confident that the programs identifications will be
|  reliable (and for BATCH/DEMO use), this graphics interaction has been
|  disabled by using the parameter TUNE_AUTLOC=YES.)
|  The positions (rows) of the orders are then listed and an
|  estimate of the width of the orders is made.
|
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
|  The program then displayed an abbreviated version of
|  the main menu. This abbreviated form is used from now on, EXCEPT
|  when a full menu is explicitly requested by the user, or after
|  detailed HELP has been given on a menu topic. The abbreviated
|  menu consists of the previous/current/next suggested options,
|  along with any closely related options (which will typically
|  provide additional functionality/diagnostics), plus general utilities.
|  The program has also altered its suggested next option to
|  number 2 - Trace the orders, and to accept this choice we
|  need only to hit Y<return>.
|
|  The tracing option prompts for parameters which control the
|  process. The second prompt is for the number of polynomial
|  coefficients to use in fitting the order traces.

|
|  Order tracing: ech_trace/echmenu option 2
|  -----------------------------------------
|
|  The program then prompts for values for other tracing control
|  parameters.  The demo accepts the default values as these will
|  normally produce decent traces.  A large number of different
|  methods for tracing orders are supported.
|
|  Once the necessary parameters have been supplied the program
|  traces each order in turn (starting at lowest Y value) and
|  reports on the sucess of each trace.
