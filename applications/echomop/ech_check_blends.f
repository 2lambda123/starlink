*  Name:
*     ECHOMOP - ECH_CHECK_BLENDS

*  Purpose:
*     Check for potential blends amongst identified arc lines.

*  Description:
*     This routine uses the feature lists to check for potential blends which
*     have so far been treated as single-point features.  The status of the
*     features it recorded by setting flag bits in the array FEATURE_STATUS()
*     for each feature.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ECH_CHECK_BLENDS(
*     :    MAX_FEATURES,
*     :    FTR_LIST,
*     :    MAX_PERM_FTRS,
*     :    IDENTIFIED_FTRS,
*     :    WAVELENGTHS,
*     :    FEATURE_STATUS,
*     :    DELTA,
*     :    BLENDS,
*     :    STATUS
*     :   )

*  Arguments:
*     MAX_PERM_FTRS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Maximum number of features per order.
*     IDENTIFIED_FTRS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of identified features.
*     WAVELENGTHS = REAL( MAX_PERM_FEATURES ) (Given)
*        Wavelengths of features from fit.
*     FEATURE_STATUS = INTEGER( MAX_PERM_FEATURES ) (Given)
*        Flag words for feature stati.
*     DELTA = REAL (Given)
*        Maximum difference in wavelength for unblended features.
*     BLENDS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of potential blends found.
*     MAX_FEATURES = INTEGER (Given)
*        Maximum number of observed features per order.
*     FTR_LIST = REAL( MAX_FEATURES ) (Given)
*        List of known arc line wavelengths.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Input/Output status conditions.

*  Method:
*     Find the maximum and minimum indicies into ftr_list referenced
*     Loop through the identified features wavelengths
*         Loop through feature list entries
*             If two features in the list are so close to each other
*                   in wavelength, that they may be blended then
*                Increment possibly matched feature count
*             Endif
*         End loop
*         Clear 'not-processed' flag
*         If no possible identifications for this feature in the list then
*            Flag observed feature as 'Not automatically identifiable'
*         Else if only 1 possible match in feature list then
*            Flag observed feature as 'Automatically identified'
*         Else  (its a possible blend)
*            Increment count, and flag feature as 'Possible blend'
*            List potential components
*         Endif
*     End loop
*     Report on success rate

*  Bugs:
*     None known.
