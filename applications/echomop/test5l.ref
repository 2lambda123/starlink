 Starting processing task:     Model flat field.                (ECH_FFIELD)

 TUNE_FFLSMP is set to non-default value: 31.
 TUNE_FFNXPLY is set to non-default value: 5.

 Processing order 1...
 Fitting (coeffs=3) POLY to flat-field spatial dependence.
 (this usage is appropriate when the dekker is filled by bright pixels,
 if the dekker extends beyond the bright section then unwanted edge effects
  may cause problems.  Use X-fit and TUNE_FFSUBSMP in this case.)
