<h1>Echomop reductions using a ramdisk</h1>

<p>I've been doing a little experimenting with ECHOMOP on our alphas.

<P>We found that when one user is running an echelle data reduction job this
takes a fair while, and that the machine is very slow for all other users
(You can type faster than the machine can echo the characters...).  This
appears to be because the echelle process is spending a lot of time in WAIT
states while accessing data on disk.
<P>

I've run a single reduction (options 1 to 8 in ECHOMOP) in a few different
configurations: with data on a local disk, with data on an nfs mounted disk
and with data on a local RAM disk.  The data were all 1024x512 pixel CCD
frames.
<P>

These are the results:
<P>

Machine: zuaxp0, DEC Alpha 2000/300, OSF/1 v3.2.

<PRE>
Data location  U.CPU  S.CPU  Elapsed  %CPU
Remote disk      73    156    20:20     19
Local disk       85    113    13:54     23
RAM disk         71     95     4:32     60
</PRE>

These were one-off tests with the echelle job being the only "CPU-hungry"
user process (I did the timed tests one evening).
<P>

It's clear that running with data on a local disk instead of remote saves
time - as you would expect.
<P>

The RAM disk used was 50Mbytes - more than enough for a single dataset of
this type.  We found that apart from the faster echelle reduction process
the general performance of the machine for other users was "better" when
using the RAM disk.  Of course, this depends what everyone else is doing at
the time...
<P>

Some extra time should be added for copying the dataset to and from the
ram disk (&lt;3s CPU time, &lt;30s elapsed time) and the CPU time required by
the mount_mfs process which runs the ramdisk (~25% of the echelle CPU time).
<P>

It's not at all difficult to set up a ramdisk on the alphas - Adrian did so
in a couple of minutes.  Anyone using ECHOMOP (especially using it a lot)
may like to experiment with a ramdisk at their site.
