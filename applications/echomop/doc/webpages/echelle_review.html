<H1>Echelle Data Reduction Review</H1>
<HR>

I'm reviewing existing Echelle and multi-object data reduction
techniques with a view to finding the most suitable facilities to improve,
upgrade and so on in the future.  All input on this topic is
welcome.  Anyone with experience of more than one of the existing packages
may be able to contribute useful advice or observations upon the problems
of Echelle data reduction.
<P>

Part of my review process will involve considering what's likely to be
needed in the near future, so, again, any significant new instruments I'd
like to know about (hopefully I'll be aware of them anyway...)
<P>
