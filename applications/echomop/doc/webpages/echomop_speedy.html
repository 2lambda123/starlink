<H1>ECHOMOP on OSF/1 Systems</H1>
<HR>

It has recently become possible to implement the Starlink NDF/HDS system file
mapping features under OSF/1.  A new version of echomop will be released in
1995/Q4 which will be linked to use the new HDS.  This should give significant
performance gains under OSF/1, typically echomop reduction operations 1 to 8
are completed in one fifth of the time.  The overall loading of your machine
will also be reduced.
<P>

It is possible to implement a ramdisk (as described recently in a Starlink
newsgroup) to achieve a further improvement in reduction speed.  My own tests
gave the following results:
<P>

Machine: zuaxp0, DEC Alpha 2000/300, OSF/1 v3.2.<BR>
Data: UCLES, 1024x512 pixel CCD images.<BR>
NDisk = data on remote nfs disk.<BR>
LDisk = data on local disk.<BR>
RDisk = data on RAM disk.<BR>

<PRE WIDTH=72>
Test           U.CPU  S.CPU  Elasped  %CPU
Nomap/NDisk      72    165    21:30     18
Nomap/RDisk      73     96     5:12     54
Map/NDisk        43     11     4:07     22
Map/Ldisk        43      6     3:35     22
Map/RDisk        42     10     2:03     41
</PRE>

You can see that the mapping-HDS/ramdisk combination is about ten times faster
than a "normal" reduction.  Allowing for to-from ramdisk copying (~30s), a
factor eight recuction in elapsed time is still possible.
<P>

Generally it's a good idea to run echomop on <B>the same machine</B> as the
disk which is storing the data.  You can expect to save about 12% on elasped
time by this means.
