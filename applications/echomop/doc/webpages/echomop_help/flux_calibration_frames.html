<HR><H2>Flux Calibration Frames</H2><HR>
<P>
 If flux calibration is to be done then the calibration frame must
 be presented in a Starlink sdf in the same form as the data frame.
 ECHOMOP presently insists that ALL frames are of the same x and
 y dimensions (a pretty safe bet).  The user should take care to
 ensure the correct extraction of the calibration frame.  For example
 a different CCD bias voltage may have been used to that which
 was used for the object data frame, etc.
<P>
 Flux calibration is not usually performed on the very high
 resolution spectra produced by UCLES.  This is due in the main
 to the lack of suitable reference tables.  As more UCLES data
 becomes available this situation should improve.
