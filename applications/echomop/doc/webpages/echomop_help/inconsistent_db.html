<P>
 The program has detected a potential inconsistency between the .ARC
 file and the .FDB database file for the arc line list specified by
 the user. The database is generated using the .ARC list and
 includes a specification of the location of the list used within
 it. The most likely cause is that although the list has not been
 changed, it has been moved to a new location. In this case there is
 no need to re-generate the database. A task will be provided to
 update the databases' arc list reference  for this case (future).
<P>
 If the arc line list HAS been changed, then it is necessary to
 regenerate the .FDB database file before proceeding. This is a very
 CPU intensive task and the user may prefer to perform it in batch
 using the supplied command file ECH_MAKE_FDBS. Note that if the arc
 line list is a standard one then the system manager will need to be
 asked to perform the operation.
