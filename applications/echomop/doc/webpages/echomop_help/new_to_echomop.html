<HR><H2>New to ECHOMOP</H2><HR>
<P>
 ECHOMOP may be used in a variety of ways depending upon the
 expertise of the user.
<P>
 The most convenient method for the first time user is to start
 ECHOMOP with a menu interface (command ECHMENU). This provides a
 guided path through the processes in a standard reduction.
<P>
 ECHMENU is the monolith program which drives all the other programs
 in the package. The ECHMENU task will always provide a default for
 the next task to be performed, and this will usually be the correct
 one for a standard reduction. To accept the recommended next step,
 it is only necessary to hit Y/return/.
<P>
 The package uses a disc based 'reduction file' to pass objects
 between its various component tasks. The user will be asked to
 provide a filename for this file, which will be created in the
 current directory. This file is  permanently associated with a
 particular set of data frames (object,arc,flat etc.) thereby
 providing the ability to replay any aspect of the reduction at a
 later date. Reduction files can occupy a large amount of disk space
 however, and many users will wish to delete them as soon as the
 reduced spectrum has been obtained.
<P>
 To start ECHOMOP using a guided menu type
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
    ECHMENU /return/
</PRE>
<P>
 at the command line prompt.
<P>
 To run any particular ECHOMOP command just type its name at the
 command line prompt.
<P>
 For example:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
    ECH_LOCATE /return/
</PRE>
<P>
 would run the order location task.
