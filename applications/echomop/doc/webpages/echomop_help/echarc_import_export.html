<HR><H2>ECHARC import/export</H2><HR>
<P>
 In order to provide backward compatibility with the extensive
 line fitting ECHARC software, ECHOMOP provides the ability to
 import/export sets of line positions/identifications between
 itself and ECHARC. These facilities are provided from the main
 menu of the ECH_IDWAVE option/task. The exchange of information
 takes place on two levels. ECHARC requires an arc spectrum
 array organised on a nx by number of orders basis, plus a
 set of order numbers (1...n) in another array. These are setup
 in a .sdf file with a name chosen by the user. This filename
 should be provided to ECHARC as its input image name. ECHARC
 automatically read/writes the other file, an ASCII file
 listing the order number,position,wavelengths of all identified
 features. This file has the name ECHARC.LIS and is placed in the
 current directory. ECHARC also uses the  arc line reference
 lists (i.e. /arctype/.ARC) and the same file should of course be used
 with both programs.
<P>
 Note that ECHOMOPs' ECHARC export option must be used first in
 order to create the .sdf file required to use ECHARC, this MUST
 be done even if no lines are identified before ECHARC is run.
