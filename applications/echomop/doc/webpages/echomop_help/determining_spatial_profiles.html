<HR><H2>Determining Spatial Profiles</H2><HR>
<P>
 The determination of the position of the object data within the
 slit proceeds by first locating the slit jaws. To do this either an
 ARC frame or (ideally) a flat-field frame may be used.
<P>
 The profile is calculated along the slit and the edges are then
 located by determining the points where the profile intensity drops
 below a (tunable) threshold. For problem cases the dekker positions
 may also be indicated manually on a graph of the ARC/Flat field
 profile.
<P>
A typical interactive plot appears below.

 Once the dekker limits have been determined, the object profile
 is measured.  The object is sampled by averaging the profile
 over all orders (using the central columns of the frame only).
<P>
 The median intensity of the profile inside the dekker limits
 is then calculated and used to set an expected sky threshold.
<P>
 The profile is then examined by stepping outwards from its peak
 until the profile intensity falls to the expected sky threshold.
<P>
 Masks are then created in which each pixel along the slit is
 flagged as sky or object.  The user may also interactively
 edit these masks and flag particular sections of the profile
 as sky or object.  Only pixels flagged as 'object' will contribute
 to an extraction.
<P>
A typical interactive plot appears below.

 Therefore the profile editing provides a (tedious) simple mechanism
 for producing spatially resolved spectra (each spatial increment in
 turn is flagged as the only object pixel in the profile, and
 extracted).
<P>
 The default behaviour is to average all the orders together thus
 generating a composite profile.  In certain circumstances it may be
 necessary to derive a separate profile for each order (for instance
 for multi-fibre spectra).  To select this option the tuning
 parameter TUNE_USE_NXF=1 must be set.
