<HR><H2>Sloping Orders</H2><HR>
<P>
 A common problem when extracting Echelle orders is that they are
 significantly sloped with respect to the pixel rows/ columns.
<P>
 The ECHOMOP package can cope with highly sloping orders because it
 works by first locating a single point in each order and then using
 this as the start point for tracing the order path.
<P>
 ECHOMOP also calculates the approximate slope of the orders prior
 to tracing, and uses this information to predict the order position
 when tracing fails (usually due to contaminated pixels).
<P>
 The slope is estimated by taking averaged samples of the frame
 along two lines. One running from top-left to bottom-right and the
 other from top-right to bottom-left, of the frame.
<P>
 These diagonals are then searched for peaks, starting from the
 frame centre outwards towards the corners. This convoluted method
 is immune from problems due to partial orders which affect other
 algorithms, as each must be identified twice to allow its slope to
 be estimated. Partial orders which are only sampled once by the
 diagonals will not confuse the estimate.
<P>
 The estimate obtained by this method is however, an average value
 over all orders. It is therefore not applicable when the orders are
 highly distorted, or when each order has a different slope.
<P>
 The slope as calculated by the program may be overridden manually
 using the FIGARO command SETOBJ:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
    SETOBJ object=/rdctn-file/.MORE.ECHELLE.ORDER_SLOPE value=n.nnnn
</PRE>
<P>
 where n.nnnn= the x/y pixel ratio.
