<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>
 The program could not trace the order at all. The user should check
 the the frame being used is the correct one and that is correctly
 orientated with the long axis of the orders in the x direction
 (horizontal).
<P>
 If tracing is being attempted using a cosmic ray contaminated frame
 then the ECH_DECOS1 option/task should be used to clean the frame
 prior to tracing.
<P>
 The tunable parameter TUNE_MXSMP determines the number of sampled
 increments across the frame and thus their separation. In general
 increasing TUNE_MXSMP will assist the program in tracing difficult
 orders. The user should also experiment with the various modes of
 tracing (controlled by TRACE_MODE parameter) which should allow
 most cases to be traced. As a last resort the program also provides
 a manual trace mode in which points specified using a graphics
 cursor (ICUR program) can be used as the basis for the tracing
 process.
