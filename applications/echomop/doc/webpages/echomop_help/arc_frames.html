<HR><H2>Arc Frames</H2><HR>
<P>
 The wavelength calibration process may be performed using either
 a single ARC frame, or by using two frames (before and after the
 object exposure) and having the wavelength scale interpolated.
<P>
 The advantage of using a single frame (possibly generated by
 co-adding the before and after arc frames) is that this allows
 the resolution of the final spectrum to be easily investigated.
<P>
 This is because the arc spectrum is always extracted in an
 identical manner to that of the object; using the first (and in this
 case only) supplied arc frame.
<P>
 Using two frames and having to interpolate the wavelength scale
 will be most useful when there is a significant shift during the
 exposure such that co-adding the two arcs would produce a frame
 with 'doubled' lines.
<P>
 The user should note that in this situation
 the generated wavelength scale is only a guess based on the
 assumption that difference between the two arcs was due only to a
 stable linear variation during the exposure. It is the users
 responsibility in this case to ensure that the fractional weights
 assign to the two arcs (user parameter TUNE_SCFRACT) is appropriate
 to the specific situation.
