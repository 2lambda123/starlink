<HR><H2>Tracing the Orders</H2><HR>
<P>
 The tracing of the paths of the orders across the data frame is
 often a source of difficulty as it is fairly easy for blemishes in
 the frame to fatally deflect order tracing algorithms from the
 actual path of the order. ECHOMOP provides a variety of options to
 help combat these problems.
<P>
 EHCOMOP order tracing first locates the positions of the orders at
 the centre of the frame, and estimates the average order slope.
<P>
 It uses this information to predict the existence of any partial
 orders at the top/bottom of the frame which may have been missed by
 the examination of the central columns during order location.
 Tracing then proceeds outwards from the centre of each order.
<P>
 At each step outwards a variable size sampling box  is used to
 gather a set of averages for the rows near the expected order
 centre. The centre of this data is then evaluated by one of the
 following methods:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Gaussian</B> <DD>Attempts to fit a Gaussian profile
                across the data. Works well for
                bright object frames.
<P>
<DT><B>Centroid</B> <DD>Calculates the centroid of the data.
                Most generally applicable method.
<P>
<DT><B>Edge</B> <DD>Detects the upper and lower 'edge's
                of the data and interpolates. Is
                less accurate but works well for
                difficult flat fields  (e.g. saturated)
<P>
<DT><B>Balance</B> <DD>Calculates the centre of gravity
                balance point). Works well for
                difficult data when G and C methods
                are having problems.
<P>
<DT><B>Retrace</B> <DD>Uses a previous trace as a template
                to predict the trace whenever it
                cannot be centred. Will normally be
                used in conjunction with automatic
                trace consistency checking to improve
                poorly traced orders.
<P>
 <DT><B>User</B> <DD>The last resort allows the user to
                manually indicate a set of points
                close to the order centre. Then functions
                as for Retrace by using a polynomial
                through the supplied points to predict
                order position whenever it is lost.
</DL>
<P>
 The trace algorithm will loop increasing its sampling box size
 automatically when it fails to find an explicit centre. The sample
 box can increase up to a size governed by the measured average
 order separation.
<P>
 When a set of centres have been obtained for an order, a polynomial
 is fitted to their coordinates. The degree being selectable by the
 user. For ideal data, these polynomials will represent an accurate
 reflection of the path of the order across the frame.
<P>
 For real data it is usually helpful to refine these polynomials by
 clipping the most deviant points, and re-fitting. Options are
 provided to do this automatically or manually.
<P>
 When dealing with distorted data it is often necessary to use a
 high degree polynomial to accurately fit the order traces.
<P>
 This in turn can lead to problems at the edges of the frame when
 the order is often faint. Typically the polynomial will 'run away'
 from the required path. The simplest solution is of course to
 re-fit with a lower order polynomial, however, this may not be
 satisfactory if the high degree is necessary to obtain a good fit
 over the rest of the order.
<P>
 In these circumstances, and others where one or more orders
 polynomials have 'run away', ECHOMOP provides an automatic
 consistency checker. The consistency checking task works by fitting
 polynomials to order-number/y coord at a selection of positions
 across the frame.
<P>
 The predicted order centres from both sets of polynomials are then
 compared with each other and then mean and sigma differences
 calculated. The 'worst' order is then corrected by re-calculating
 its trace polynomial using the remaining orders (but excluding its
 own contribution). This process is repeated until the mean
 deviation between the polynomials falls below a (tunable) threshold
 value.
<P>
 The consistency checker will also cope with the 'bad' polynomials
 which can result when partial orders have been automatically
 fitted.
<P>
 The order traces may also be viewed overlaid on the trace frame if
 DISPLAY=YES is used.
