<P>
 The ECHOMOP package is primarily orientated to processing
 single frame observations.  Facilities exist in ADAM for
 the combining of multiple spectra obtained from the
 reduction of a set of data frames.  ECHOMOP does however
 provide assistance for the situations where the data frames
 are well registered, removing the necessity for steps such
 as Order location, tracing, and profiling, to be performed
 for each frame.  The 'clone' option allows the selective
 copying of sections of a previous reduction file, which
 then becomes the baseline for the reduction of another
 similar frame.  Optionally the definition file itself can
 be altered to permit the extension of the reduction file
 structure to include multiple spectra from a single observed
 source (See 'Redefining Object paths' for an example of this).
