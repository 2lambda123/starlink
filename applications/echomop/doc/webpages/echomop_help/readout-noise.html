<HR><H2>Readout Noise</H2><HR>
<P>
 CCD detectors are subject to an error due to the final
 amplification immediately prior to the data leaving the chip.
<P>
 This is called readout noise and is due to uncertainty in the
 operation of the on chip amplifier. Recent developments have led to
 very significant improvements in this area (giving readout noise of
 less than 1 count per pixel), but many older chips are still in
 use.
<P>
 The package expects the value for readout noise to be specified in
 the data frame itself (for CCD frames).  The user should check that
 the package has obtained the correct value.
<P>
 Some of the more modern CCD's use multiple on-chip amplifiers in
 order to provide a more rapid readout facility. In theory each of
 these will have its own independent readout noise value. Currently
 this package provides no additional support for such cases and
 assumes that a single readout noise value is applicable for the
 whole frame.
