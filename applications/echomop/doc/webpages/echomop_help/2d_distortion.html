<HR><H2>2D Distortion</H2><HR>
<P>
 Detectors such as the IPCS often cause major geometric distortions
 in the image created using them. ECHOMOP provides a mechanism for
 modeling such distortion, and using that model to provide
 corrections during the extraction process. It is also possible
 to generate a 'corrected' version of each order, for visual
 examination, or processing by other (single spectra) software.
<P>
 The distortion modeling uses a coordinate system based on
 x = calibrated wavelength at trace, y = pixel offset from trace,
 and is thus performed independently for each order in turn.
<P>
 The ARC frame is used to locate the positions of each identified
 are line at a variety of offsets from the trace centre. The
 difference between its wavelength (as identified) and that predicted
 by the wavelength polynomial for its observed position is then
 calculated. It is these differences which are fitted using the
 2D polynomial routine E02CAF/E02DAF (from the NAG library).
<P>
 Once a 2D fit has been obtained, it is refined by either manual
 or automatic clipping of deviant points. When done manually
 the positions of all the points being fitted (i.e. arc line centres)
 may be plotted in a highly exaggerated form, in which systematic
 distortions of sub-pixel magnitude are readily apparent.
<P>
 As the wavelength scale produced by the distortion fitting leads
 inevitably to some re-binning when the extraction takes place,
 it is normal to extract into a scrunched wavelength scale (e.g.
 constant bin size) and this is the default behavior of the 2D
 extraction task/option.
