<P>
 The sky intensity may be modeled using a poly/spline at each
 increment along the order. The degree of the polynomials is tunable
 and by default is set to 0 to obtain the 'mean' sky behavior.
<P>
 The use of polynomials of higher degree is useful when there is a
 significant gradient to the sky intensity along the slit, as the
 polynomials are used to predict the sky intensity at each object
 pixel in the order independently. Note that the meaning of
 'increment' differs between regular and 2D distortion corrected
 extractions.
<P>
 For a simple extraction an increment is a single pixel column. For
 a 2D extraction each increment is a scrunched wavelength scale
 unit, thus ensuring the accurate modeling of distorted bright
 emission lines in the sky.
<P>
 The determination of which pixels are sky pixels is done using the
 masks determined by the profiling task/option. These masks can be
 freely edited to cope with any special requirements as to which
 regions of the slit are to be used for the sky.
<P>
 This facility is of particular use when processing frames where
 'periscopes' have been used to add in 'sky' regions when observing
 an extended source. In such cases ECHOMOP currently provides no
 special treatment and the periscope sky pixels' positions will have
 to be edited into the sky mask using the ECH_SPATIAL task/option.
