<P>
 An attempt has been made to access a reduction object using
 dimensions different from those operative at the time of its
 creation. This will usually be due to the changing of a user tuning
 (TUNE_???) parameter which is used to specify the dimension, or due
 to a change in wavelength scale during scrunching (which changes
 dimensioning objects NX_REBIN and NO_OF_BINS). The name of the
 parameter is shown along with its 'old' and current value.
<P>
 If a tuning parameter is involved then there are two courses of
 action available. The first option is to reset the parameter to its
 previous value and continue with the reduction. The second option
 is to delete from the reduction file the object which has been
 created using the 'old' value. Such objects must then be re-created
 using the new parameter value by invoking the relevant processing
 options. The program will prompt the user as to which course of
 action is required. It should be noted that in some cases deleting
 an object may necessitate the re-running of an earlier option in
 order to re-create it, and re-calculate its contents. In this case
 the program will inform the user which step needs repeating.
