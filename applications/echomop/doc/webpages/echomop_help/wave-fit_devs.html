<P>
 The fitted polynomial has been rejected due to an excessive RMS
 deviation measure. Usually the rejection will be valid and the
 program will proceed to locate the a better set of identifications.
 However, if looking at the other orders the user determines that
 this identifications was likely to be correct for the order, then
 ECH_IDWAVE should be used in its manual mode of operation.
 Specifying an appropriate search range for the  order and using the
 AI option will let the program relocate the set of identifications
 it rejected when running automatically. The user can then accept
 the set and interactively improve it by adding/removing individual
 line identifications.
