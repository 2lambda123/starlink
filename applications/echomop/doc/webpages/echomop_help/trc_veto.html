<H2>Usage</H2>
<H3>TRC_VETO=_LOGICAL</H3>
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
 Set to YES if the order consistency to be checked interactively.
 Automatic checking is performed otherwise.  When automatic checking
 is engaged there are two tuning parameters which may be adjusted to
 optimise the performance of the program.  These are TUNE_CLPMAXDEV
 which defines the clipping point, and TUNE_CLPBY which is the number
 of points to clip in each iteration.  When TRC_VETO is set, the user
 is given the chance to reject a re-fitted order at each iteration.
 It is strongly recommended that this option is not used until the
 user has a clear understanding of the algorithm used by the
 consistency checker, as it is possible to 'drive' the fit off by
 injudicious rejection of the re-fits proposed by the program.
