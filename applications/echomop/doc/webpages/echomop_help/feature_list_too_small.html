<P>
 The package uses a special arc line information database to
 optimise its search algorithm. This algorithm requires sets of
 approx. 12 lines with which to work. The database consists of lines
 and their 10 nearest neighbours on each side (l/r). The arc line
 list supplied (.ARC file) by the user does not contain sufficient
 lines for the database to be useful. Either more lines must be
 added to the list, or another program (such as ECHARC) must be used
 for the line identification phase. It is permissible to add dummy
 entries to the line list just to overcome this limitation, however
 in this case it is unlikely that automatic identification will work
 and the program will probably need to be run interactively.
