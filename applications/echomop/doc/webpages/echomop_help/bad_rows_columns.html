<HR><H2>Bad Rows/columns</H2><HR>
<P>
 It is still common for CCD detectors to suffer from bad rows or
 columns. These typically present anomalously high counts (usually
 identical for each pixel in the row/column). A facility is provided
 to check frames for this problem, any such pixels are then flagged
 as having bad data quality and omitted from consideration in the
 subsequent processes.
<P>
 As the presence of bad rows/columns is normally a static process
 (i.e. all images from a particular chip exhibit the same bad
 row/column), the package only examines one frame at the start of
 the reduction. This should be the object frame, as the check will
 append a data quality array to the frame, and it needs to be
 attached to the object frame to be 'seen' by subsequent processing.
<P>
 The checking for bad row/columns is disabled by default and may be
 selected using the tunable parameter TUNE_FCHECK.
<P>
 An additional parameter allows for 'saturated' pixels to also be
 flagged as bad, by setting the tunable parameter TUNE_SATRTN to the
 minimum saturated pixel intensity.
