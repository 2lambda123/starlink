<H2>Function</H2>
Write results sdf files.
<P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
 The package provides a set of different ways of generating results
 in the forms of graphs, ascii listings of intensities, and STARLINK
 standard sdf files which are ideal for further analysis.
<P>
 This option controls the construction of sdf container files which
 may contain single orders, 2D arrays containing all orders, or
 scrunched and merged whole frame spectra.
<P>
 Spectra may be from the object or arc and may be either scrunched
 or as-extracted. In all cases the accompanying variance arrays and
 wavelengths are included in the container file.  The module can
 also optionally list the stored values in ascii format to a .DMP
 file.
<P>
 The module also provides the automatic archiving capability.
 Whenever a set of orders, or a fully merged spectrum is output, the
 package will construct an additional container file containing a
 copy of the results along with all the header information from the
 raw data frame and the names of any other frames used in the
 extraction.
<P>
 The name of this file is then passed to the central archiving site
 which will include it in the archive and delete the local copy.
<P>
 Archived results files are protected against access by other
 astronomers until two years after their submission date (although
 their observer may explicitly release them for general access if
 required).
<P>
 The archive indexes files according to the categories defined in
 the Astronomy and Astrophysics Abstracts classification scheme and
 the module will prompt the user for the information necessary to
 establish the correct classification.
<P>
 Once the archive reaches critical mass, functions will be provided
 to search and retrieve files from it over the networks. At present
 a simple LIST command is provided which lists details of any files
 submitted by the sender. See HELP  Archiving_functions for more
 information.
