<HR>

This page lists the changes made to ECHOMOP between the current release
<A HREF="echomop_v320.html">version 3.2-0</A>, and the next release version 
3.3-0.
<P>

<B>
This will be an interim release of ECHOMOP.
<P>

This file will often be updated as and when fixes and changes are
implemented, until version 3.3-0 is made available for release.
Contact <A HREF="mailto:mjc@star.ucl.ac.uk">Martin Clayton</A> if you
need access to a fixed version of ECHOMOP prior to the release.

<UL>
<LI>The output option (Option 14) can now produce DIPSO stacks of
   echelle data.  For example, to output a stack called 'ECHOMOP_STK.sdf'
   containing the extracted object orders:

<PRE>
   % ech_result result_format=stack result_type=extobj stack=ECHOMOP
</PRE>

   See the on-line HELP for more details.
<LI>When writting an ASCII file in Option 14 the name of the file can
   now be changed by setting the parameter ASCII_FILE.
<LI>In the plotter, the ASCII-dump option now produces a files which
   DIPSO SP2RD can read.  The output filename is no longer fixed.
</UL>

<H2><IMG SRC="gifs/ball.green.gif" ALT="o"> Other changes</H2>
<UL>

<LI>The Thorium-Argon arc-line list and database have been expanded.
<LI>A line list and database for Thorium-Neon arcs has been added.
   The relevant files are THNE.ARC and THNE.sdf.
<LI>An extra line has been added to the Copper-Argon line list and 
   database.
<LI>Non-standard PGPLOT calls have been removed from the source code.
   This will lead to a minor performance improvement.
<LI>Deferred PGPLOT errors (which would be reported on exit from
   ECHOMOP) have been removed.
<LI>HELP is now available within the plotter task.

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>The program now reports an error when unable to successfully
   access an input file.  The program reprompts the user.
   Previously the program would crash when trying to use "unaccessed"
   data.
<LI>The "Path syntax" in the plotter is now correctly displayed.
<LI>In browse mode in the plotter SPLINE traces are now supported.
   Previously POLY was assumed with unpredictable side-effects.
<LI>Limits in plotter browse mode are now correctly enforced, avoiding
   common crashes.
<LI>All advertised style options in the plotter now work.
<LI>A bug in Option 3 (Trace clip), which would decrease the number of
   knots for a SPLINE fit by 2 on each invocation, has been removed.
<LI>In Option 14 (Output results) the OSPECT output product can now
   be used without causing a crash.
<LI>The conversion from air to vacuum wavelengths enabled by
   TUNE_AIRTOVAC is applied to the output data file when requested.
   Previously, the correction was applied to the reduction database
   wavelengths, not to the output file.
