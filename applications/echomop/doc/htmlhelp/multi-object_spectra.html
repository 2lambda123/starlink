<HR><H2>Multi-object Spectra</H2><HR>
<P>
 Although ECHOMOP was produced for the reduction of data taken with
 the UCLES Echelle Spectrograph, it is in no way limited to processing
 data from this particular instrument, or even, to data from echelle
 spectrographs.  The package can equally well be used on multi-object
 spectra obtained, for example, using the popular fibre based
 instruments.  If you are processing this type of data the following
 points need to be remembered.
<P>
 Each spectrum will need to be independently wavelength calibrated
 as the expected inter-order relationship checked for by completely
 automatic calibration will not be valid.  Automatic identification
 of lines will however, still be possible on an object-by-object
 basis and if all the spectra have the same range (in wavelength),
 then the wavelength limits obtained on successfully calibrating
 the first object can be used as constraints for the others.
 In this instance the ech_idwave option/task would be run
 interactively for the first object, and then via a command such
 as the example below (for object 2), for all the remaining objects.
<P>

                 ...other parameter settings...\
                 MIN_WAVE=3250. \
                 MAX_WAVE=3295. \
