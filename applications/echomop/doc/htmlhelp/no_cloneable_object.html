<P>
 The program is unable to copy reduction structure objects from the
 specified reduction structure file.
<P>
 The possible causes are that the object in question does not exist
 in the reduction file specified (either using TUNE_CLONE or the '<'
 indirection operator in echmenu), or that the object is dimensioned
 differently from the corresponding object in the primary reduction
 structure file.  Objects can only be copied when their
 dimensionalities are identical (i.e., they have the same number of
 X-pixels, number of orders etc.)
<P>
 To check the dimensions of the object you are trying to clone from,
 use the hdstrace command and the object path as reported by the
 program.  If the only dimensions which differ are controlled by
 TUNE_??? parameters, then you may adjust the relevant parameter to
 allow the object to be successfully copied (Note that this in turn
 may necessitate re-running parts of the reduction to re-generate
 other objects also dimensioned using the same TUNE_??? parameter).
