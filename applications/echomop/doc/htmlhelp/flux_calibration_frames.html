<HR><H2>Flux Calibration Frames</H2><HR>
<P>
 If flux calibration is to be done then the calibration frame must
 be presented in a Starlink sdf in the same form as the data frame.
<P>
 ECHOMOP presently insists that all frames are of the same X- and
 Y-dimensions (a pretty safe bet).  Care should be taken to ensure
 the correct extraction of the calibration frame.  For example,
 a different CCD bias voltage may have been used to that which used
 for the object data frame, etc.
<P>
 Flux calibration is not usually performed on the very-high-resolution
 spectra produced by UCLES.  This is due in the main to the lack of
 suitable reference tables.  As more UCLES data become available this
 situation should improve.
