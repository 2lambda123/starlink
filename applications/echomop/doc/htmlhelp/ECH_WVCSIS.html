<H2>Function</H2>
Enforce consistent wavelength scales.
<P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
 This function performs a function analogous to that performed by
 Option 16 (order traces), only operating upon the wavelength fits.
<P>
 It is used after option 10 has calculated the wavelength scales.
<P>
 The wavelength-consistency check is confined to those areas beyond
 the range within which lines have been identified.  It therefore
 only corrects the very ends of the orders wavelength scales.
<P>
 These are the regions where problems are most likely to occur, as
 the polynomial fits can become unstable when a high number of
 coefficients has been used, and there are no fitted points for a
 substantial fraction of the order (e.g. first 20%).
