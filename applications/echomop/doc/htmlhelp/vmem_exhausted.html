<P>
 The program has run out of virtual memory space.
<P>
 In some cases erroneous setting of some of the TUNE_ parameters can
 lead to virtual memory exhaustion.  To check if this is the problem,
 use a second process to run "top" whilst repeating the commands
 which led to the problem.  The size of virtual memory used by the
 process is shown on the display and the exact point at which it
 exceeds its limiting value determined.
<P>
 In many cases the problem may be solved by re-starting the program,
 but frequent occurrences should be investigated as described above.
<P>
 A diagnostic listing is also produced which specifies the current
 state of allocated memory.  This listing is saved in
 ECH_MEM_USAGE.DMP and should be kept for examination by the package
 maintainer in difficult cases.
