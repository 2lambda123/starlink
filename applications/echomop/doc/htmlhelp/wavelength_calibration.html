<HR><H2>Wavelength Calibration</H2><HR>
<P>
 The wavelength calibration is done using a reference feature list,
 usually provided by an arc-lamp exposure.  The routine allows any
 candidate features to be identified and used as 'knowns' for the
 calibration (as position/intensity pairs).
<P>
 These features may then be manually identified using a reference
 lamp atlas.  Facilities are provided for adding/deleting lines and
 altering the degree of polynomial fit performed.
A typical interactive plot appears below.

<P>
 An automatic line identifier is included which works by searching
 the suppled line list for multi-line 'features'.  This search can
 be optimised by constraining the space to be searched in terms of
 permissible wavelength and/or dispersions (in pixels/Angstrom).  In
 addition, the program will automatically constrain the search range
 further if it can determine the central order number and wavelength
 (by looking in the data frame header).
<P>
 As soon as two orders have been successfully calibrated, the search
 range for the remaining orders is re-evaluated to take this into
 account.  In general the automatic method will be most useful when
 you are unsure of the exact wavelength range covered.
<P>
 When the level of doubt is such that the wavelength scale may
 decrease from left to right across the frame, then the software may
 be instructed to automatically check for this 'reversed' condition.
 The parameter TUNE_REVCHK controls this process and defaults to NO
 to avoid wasting CPU time.
<P>
 Finally, the software is flexible as to the vertical orientation of
 the orders, i.e., higher wavelength orders may be at the top or
 bottom of the frame (for echelle data).
<P>
 Calibration may be performed using either 1 or 2 (before and after)
 arc frames at present.  See ARC_FRAMES for details.
