<P>
 A data frame has been specified whose dimensions are orthogonal to
 those of an already processed frame for this reduction.
<P>
 The most likely cause is that one of the frames has been rotated and
 the other not.  The required frame geometry for the package is to
 have the orders long axis aligned with the horizontal (X-axis).  The
 solution is to ensure that all frames are consistent and then
 re-start the reduction.  In the case that the first frame specified
 needs to be rotated then the reduction process must be re-started
 from the beginning using a new reduction file (delete the current
 reduction file).  In the case that that the first frame specified
 was OK, then simply correcting the other frame and continuing with
 the reduction will suffice.
