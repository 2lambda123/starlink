<P>
 The fitted polynomial has been rejected due to an excessive RMS
 deviation measure.
<P>
 Usually the rejection will be valid and the program will proceed
 to locate a better set of identifications.  However, if looking at
 the other orders it is determined that this identifications was
 likely to be correct for the order, then ech_idwave should be used
 in manual mode.  Specifying an appropriate search range for the
 order and using the AI option will let the program relocate the set
 of identifications it rejected when running automatically.  The set
 can then be accepted and interactively improved by adding or
 removing individual line identifications.
