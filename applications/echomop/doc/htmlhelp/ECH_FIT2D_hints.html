<P>
 The calculation of the 2-D polynomials and the location of the data
 points upon which they are based are CPU intensive tasks that should
 not be performed unless it is really needed.  The best way of
 determining whether or not they are needed is of course visual
 inspection of the arc frame.  If you are unable to detect systematic
 distortion visually then there is little chance that it will impact
 severely upon the reduced spectrum.  If reassurance is required then
 the top or bottom order in the frame should be 2-D fitted and the
 View (V) option selected from the clipping menu.  This shows a
 highly exaggerated view of the fitted points and any systematic
 distortion will be immediately noticeable.
A typical interactive plot appears below.
