<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>
   ECHOMOP provides a set of tasks to assist in the reduction of
   echelle spectra.  The options available range from full-scale
   automated reduction to step-by-step order-by-order manually
   assisted processing.  Facilities to deal with image contamination
   by cosmic-ray events, and distortion due to instrument/detector
   characteristics are provided.  The programs were written primarily
   for the reduction of data from the University College London
   Echelle spectrograph (UCLES), but the algorithms are sufficiently
   flexible to permit reduction of spectra from a wide variety of
   sources.
<P>
   This version of the package runs under the Starlink environment,
   and this environment must be set up before the tasks can be
   used.  This will usually be automatically done by the system
   login procedures (check with your system manager).
