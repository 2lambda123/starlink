<HR><H2>20: Check Wave Scales</H2><HR>
<P>
 This function performs a function analogous to that performed by
 Option 16 (order traces), only operating upon the wavelength fits.
<P>
 It is thus used after option 10 has calculated the wavelength scales.
<P>
 The wavelength-consistency check is confined to those areas beyond
 the range within which lines have been identified.  It therefore only
 corrects the very ends of the order wavelength scales.
<P>
 These are the regions where problems are most likely to occur,
 as the polynomial fits can become unstable when a high number of
 coefficients has been used, and there are no fitted points for a
 substantial fraction of the order (e.g. first 20%).
