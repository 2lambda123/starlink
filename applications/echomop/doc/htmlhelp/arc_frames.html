<HR><H2>Arc Frames</H2><HR>
<P>
 The wavelength calibration process may be performed using either
 a single arc frame, or two frames between which the wavelength scale
 is interpolated.
<P>
 The advantage of using a single frame (possibly generated by
 co-adding 'before' and 'after' arc frames) is that this allows
 the resolution of the final spectrum to be easily investigated.
<P>
 This is because the arc spectrum is always extracted in an
 identical manner to that of the object; using the first (and in this
 case only) supplied arc frame.
<P>
 Using two frames and having to interpolate the wavelength scale
 will be most useful when there is a significant shift during the
 exposure such that co-adding the two arcs would produce a frame
 with 'doubled' lines.
<P>
 It should be noted that in the two-arc situation the generated
 wavelength scale is only an estimate based on the assumption that
 difference between the two arcs was due only to a stable linear
 variation between the exposures.
