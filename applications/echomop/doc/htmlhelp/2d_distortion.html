<HR><H2>2D Distortion</H2><HR>
<P>
 Detectors such as the IPCS often cause major geometric distortions
 in images created using them.  ECHOMOP provides a mechanism for
 modelling such distortion, and using the model to provide
 corrections during the extraction process. It is also possible
 to generate a 'corrected' version of each order for visual
 examination, or processing by other software.
<P>
 The distortion modelling uses a coordinate system based on
 X = calibrated wavelength at trace, Y = pixel offset from trace,
 and is thus performed independently for each order in turn.
<P>
 The arc frame is used to locate the position of each identified
 arc line at a variety of offsets from the trace centre.  The
 difference between the identified wavelength and that predicted
 by the wavelength polynomial is then calculated.  These
 differences are fitted using Chebyshev polynomials.
<P>
 Once a 2-D fit has been obtained, it is refined by either manual
 or automatic clipping of deviant points.  When done manually
 the positions of all the points being fitted (i.e. arc line centres)
 may be plotted in a highly exaggerated form, in which systematic
 distortions of sub-pixel magnitude are readily apparent.
<P>
 As the wavelength scale produced by the distortion fitting leads
 inevitably to some re-binning when the extraction takes place,
 it is normal to extract into a scrunched wavelength scale (e.g.
 constant bin size) and this is the default behavior of the 2-D
 extraction task/option.
