<H2>Function</H2>
Identify arc line wavelengths.
<P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
 This routine performs wavelength calibration using a reference
 feature list, usually provided by an arc-lamp exposure.  The routine
 expects the candidate features to be identified and used as
 'knowns' for the calibration (as position/intensity pairs).  It then
 attempts to match using a reference database; and finally generates
 polynomials to fit the observed positions of features.
<P>
 The routine allows selection of the major optional operations
 during wavelength calibration.  Options are presented in a menu
 form and selected by typing a one- or two-character string, followed
 by carriage return.  The following options are supported:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
 AI (automatic identification), initiates a search and match of the
 feature database.  Any preset limitations on the wavelength and
 dispersion range will be taken into account.  When a solution is
 found, a report of probable status is made and the options to
 investigate the solution further (I), or search
 for further solutions by re-selecting (AI) are available.
<P>
<LI>
 AF (automatic polynomial fitting), performs a cycle of fitting
 polynomials to identified lines, then clipping away any badly-deviant
 lines, and re-fitting, etc.  Fitting ceases when a stable set of
 identified features remains.
<P>
<LI>
 E (exit), leaves the line-identification menu and updates the
 reduction structure copy of the wavelength polynomial to reflect the
 latest calculated fit.
<P>
<LI>
 F (fit), does a single-shot polynomial fit to the currently
 identified lines.  A report of deviations is generated but no
 automatic clipping of deviant lines is performed.
<P>
<LI>
 H (help), provides interactive browsing of the relevant sections
 of the help library for line identification.
<P>
<LI>
 I (interactive identification), enters the interactive line
 specification/examination section.  This section provides features
 for addition/deletion/re-fitting/listing etc of identified lines.
<P>
A typical interactive plot appears below.

<LI>
 IM (import ECHARC data), is used to provide an interface to the
 ECHARC arc line identification program.  In general the XP option
 would first be used to export data for ECHARC processing.  ECHARC
 would then be run, and finally the data IMported back into this
 package.
<P>
<LI>
 O (order selection), is used to change the currently selected order
 when operating manually.  The order number to be selected is prompted
 for.
<P>
<LI>
 P (polynomial degree), is used to alter the degree of polynomial
 to be used for the wavelength fitting.  This may vary up to the
 maximum specified by the parameter TUNE_MAXPOLY.
<P>
<LI>
 XP (export data for ECHARC), is used to provide an interface to the
 ECHARC arc line identification program.  In general the XP option
 would first be used to export data for ECHARC processing.  ECHARC
 would then be run, and finally the data IMported back into this
 package.
