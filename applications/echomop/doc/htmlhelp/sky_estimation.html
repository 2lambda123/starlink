<P>
 The sky intensity at each increment along the order may be
 modelled using a polynomial or spline curve.  The degree of the
 curve fit is adjustable.  By default it is set to zero to obtain
 the mean sky behavior.
<P>
 Higher-degree polynomials are useful when there is a gradient to
 the sky intensity along the slit, as they are used to predict the
 sky intensity at each object pixel in the order independently.
<P>
 Note that the meaning of 'increment' differs between regular and
 2-D distortion corrected extractions.
<P>
 For a simple extraction an increment is a single pixel column.
<P>
 For a 2-D extraction each increment is a scrunched wavelength scale
 unit, thus ensuring the accurate modelling of distorted bright
 emission lines in the sky.
<P>
 The selection of sky pixels is done using the masks determined by
 the profiling task/option.  These masks can be freely edited to
 cope with any special requirements as to which regions of the slit
 are to be used for the sky.  This facility is of use when
 processing frames where 'periscopes' have been used to add in sky
 regions when observing an extended source.  In such cases ECHOMOP
 currently provides no special treatment and the periscope sky
 pixels' positions will have to be edited into the sky mask using
 the ech_spatial task/option.
