<P>
 An attempt has been made to access a reduction object using
 dimensions different from those operative at the time of its
 creation.
<P>
 This will usually be due to the changing of a parameter TUNE_???
 which is used to specify the dimension, or due to a change in
 wavelength scale during scrunching (which changes dimensioning
 objects NX_REBIN and NO_OF_BINS).  The name of the parameter is
 shown along with its 'old' and current value.
<P>
 If a TUNE_??? parameter is involved then there are two courses of
 action available.  The first option is to reset the parameter to its
 previous value and continue with the reduction.  The second option
 is to delete from the reduction file the object which has been
 created using the 'old' value.  Such objects must then be re-created
 using the new parameter value by invoking the relevant processing
 options.  The program will prompt asking which course of action is
 required.  It should be noted that in some cases deleting an object
 may necessitate the re-running of an earlier option in order to
 re-create it, and re-calculate its contents.  In this case, ECHOMOP
 will inform you which step needs repeating.
