<HR><H2>ECHARC import/export</H2><HR>
<P>
 In order to provide backward compatibility with the extensive
 line fitting FIGARO ECHARC software, ECHOMOP has the ability to
 import and export sets of line positions/identifications between
 itself and ECHARC.
<P>
 These facilities are provided from the main menu of the ech_idwave
 option/task.  The exchange of information takes place on two levels:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>ECHARC requires an arc spectrum array organised on an
     NX by number-of-orders basis, plus a set of order numbers
     (1...n) in another array.
<P>
<LI>ECHARC requires an ASCII file listing the order number,
     positions and wavelengths of all identified features.
</UL>
<P>
 The first file is created by ECHOMOP ech_idwave, option XP.  The
 name of the file should be given in response to the ECH_ECHAR prompt.
 The second file has the name ECHARC.LIS and is placed in the
 current directory automatically by XP.
<P>
 When starting ECHARC, give the first file name in response to the
 IMAGE prompt.  You should respond YES to the PREVIOUS prompt and
 the second file name should be given inreponse to the ARFILE
 prompt.
<P>
 ECHARC also uses the arc line reference lists (i.e. /arctype/.ARC)
 as ECHOMOP and the same file should of course be used with both
 programs.
<P>
 Note that the ECHOMOP ECHARC export option must be used first in
 order to create the sdf file required to use ECHARC, this must
 be done even if no lines are identified before ECHARC is run.
