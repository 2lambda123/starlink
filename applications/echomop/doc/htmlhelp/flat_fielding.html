<P>
 ECHOMOP will use a flat-field frame if one is available.  The
 flat-field frame should be produced using a continuum lamp exposure
 with the instrument in an identical configuration to that used for
 the object exposure (to ensure that any wavelength-dependent
 behaviour of pixel response is taken into account).  The exposure
 should be of sufficient duration to attain high counts in the
 brightest parts of the image.
<P>
 ECHOMOP fits polynomials/splines in two directions; along the traces,
 and along the image columns.  The degree of function fitted can be
 changed, but the default (low) degree will normally be perfectly
 reasonable.  Each flat-field pixel in an order is then used to
 calculate a 'balance' factor.  This is a number close to unity which
 represents the factor by which a given pixel exceeds its expected
 value (predicted by the function).
<P>
A typical interactive plot appears below.

 Note that this technique requires that the flat-field orders vary
 slowly and smoothly both along and across each order.
<P>
 If required, many flat-field frames (with identical instrument
 configuration) may be co-added to produce a single high
 signal-to-noise flat-field frame prior to using ECHOMOP.
<P>
 At present no special facilities are provided for calculating the
 actual error on such a co-added flat field; the expected error (derived
 from root N statistics) is what is used to calculate the error on the
 balance factors unless appropriate variances are provided in the
 flat-field frame error array.
<P>
 A special mode of operation is selected by setting the parameter
 FLTFIT=MEAN.  In this case the balance factors are calculated using the
 local mean value based on a 5-pixel sample.  This will normally be used
 when the flat field at the dekker limits cannot be modelled because its
 intensity changes too rapidly on a single-pixel scale due to
 under-sampling of the profile.
<P>
A typical interactive plot appears below.

<IMG SRC=ffmean.gif>
 Other special modes are available to help model difficult data,
 and the type of fit used is primarily selected using the FLTFIT
 parameter:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>FLTFIT=POLY, normal polynomial fitting.
<LI>FLTFIT=SPLINE, bi-cubic spline fits.
<LI>FLTFIT=MEAN, local means.
<LI>FLTFIT=MEDIAN, local medians.
<LI>FLTFIT=SMOOTH, Gaussian smoothing.
<LI>FLTFIT=SLOPE, local slope.
</UL>
<P>
 In the situation where a balance factor frame is independently
 produced, this may be fed to ECHOMOP as the flat-field frame.
 The parameter TUNE_PREBAL should then be set to YES.
<P>
 In this case the modelling will not take place and the balance factors
 will simply be copied from the supplied frame.  This should be used for
 special cases where the polynomial model cannot generate appropriate
 values.
<P>
 In cases where no flat-field frame is available then the parameter
 TUNE_NOFLAT=YES can be specified; or alternatively FFIELD=NONE
 set when prompted for the name of the flat-field frame.  In
 either case, all balance factors will be taken to be unity.
