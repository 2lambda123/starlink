<HR><H2>Reduction File</H2><HR>
<P>
 The reduction file is a Starlink sdf file used to contain objects
 produced during the various stages of the reduction.  For example,
 a list of order locations, wavelength polynomial fits, etc.
<P>
 The file is created at the start of a reduction cycle with a user- 
 provided name, and grows in size until the reduction is complete.
 At this point it contains a fairly complete record of any
 intermediate results, thus allowing particular sections of a
 reduction to be tuned and repeated as required.
<P>
 Usually it will not be necessary to access the file except via
 ECHOMOP commands.  The package provides facilities for examining
 and plotting data from all the objects in the file.
<P>
 The reduction file also contains a HISTORY object which provides a
 record of all significant processing decisions taken, and the data
 frames involved.  Options are provided to trim the size of
 reduction files once a reduction is complete.  They should, however,
 be saved alongside the resulting data file (spectrum) to assist any
 future analysis.
