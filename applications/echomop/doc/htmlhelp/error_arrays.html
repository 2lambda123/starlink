<HR><H2>Error Arrays</H2><HR>
<P>
 The ECHOMOP package can deal with errors from the following
 variety of sources:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Errors on the flat field frame which should be provided in
     the flat-field frame error array.   If no error array is
     provided then ECHOMOP will estimate the error using root-n
     statistics.
<P>
<LI>Errors due to the readout-noise on CCD type detectors.
     The readout noise value is supplied as a parameter and
     is applied to the whole frame when calculating the variances
     on extracted pixels.
<P>
<LI>Linear error sources determined manually may be treated
     by providing an error array associated with the object data
     frame. The values should represent an error source that does
     not vary with the intensity of the particular pixel involved.
<P>
     An example of this type of error source would be the bias
     subtraction.  If many bias frames are available then error could
     be determined for each detector pixel.  Supplying these errors
     as the object error array would then cause them to be correctly
     included in variance calculations during extraction.
<P>
<LI>Multiplicative errors such as those due to errors on the
     balance factors (from the flat field) may be taken into
     account by incorporating the appropriate values in the
     error array supplied with the flat-field frame.  You must
     ensure that these variances correctly represent the combined
     effect of both the flat-field noise and any additional
     multiplicative error sources.
<P>
<LI>Errors due to sky modelling and subtraction are calculated and
     processed internally by the extraction task.
<P>
<LI>Errors due to detected cosmic-ray hits are treated by
     ignoring the contaminated pixel and rescaling the variance
     on the remaining pixels in that wavelength increment.
<P>
<LI>All output spectra have an error array associated with them,
     these error arrays always contain the variance for the
     parallel entry in the data arrays.
