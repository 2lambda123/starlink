<HR><H2>Readout Noise</H2><HR>
<P>
 The signals from CCD detectors are subject to an uncertainty due to
 the charge-to-voltage conversion on the chip.
<P>
 This is called readout noise.  Most modern CCDs are run to not
 under-sample the noise signal, so the noise level is a couple to
 a few counts in each pixel.  Older chips with higher readout noise
 levels are still in  use.
<P>
 ECHOMOP expects the value for readout noise to be specified in
 the data frame itself (for CCD frames).  You should check that
 the correct value has been obtained.
<P>
 Some CCDs use multiple on-chip amplifiers to provide a more rapid
 readout facility.  Each of these will have its own readout noise
 value.  The best procedure for processing such frames is to split
 the image in to two sub-frames (or four for quad-amplifier chips).
 Each sub-frame should be separaetly processed in the normal way.
