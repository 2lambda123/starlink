<H2>Function</H2>
Model 2-D distortion using an arc frame.
<P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
 This routine fits a 2-D polynomial surface to the distortion present
 in an echelle order.  The order trace is used as an origin and axis,
 the X-distance running along it, and Y-offset below/above, are the
 coordinates of the fitted points.  The fitted quantity is the
 delta-wavelength of an identified arc line.  The identified line
 centres are located at all offsets above and below the trace.  These
 centres are all assigned the identified wavelength for the line,
 and then their offset (in wavelength) relative to the same lines
 position on the origin axis calculated.  This provides the following
 dataset for input in the surface fit:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
  X - coord of a line centre
  Y - Offset from trace of the line centre
  Difference in wavelength from 1-D fit prediction for coord X.
</PRE>
<P>
 Thus if no 2-D correction were necessary, all the differences would
 be zero.  Formulating the fit in this way allows maximum significance
 of the quantity of interest.
<P>
 Once a fit has been obtained, deviations from the fit of all sample
 points (line-centres) are calculated.  Theses are then either
 interactively or automatically clipped until an acceptable fit is
 obtained.
A typical interactive plot appears below.

 In addition it is possible to request a plot showing an exaggerated
 view of the modelled arc lines.  This make is easy to see if there
 is any systematic 2-D distortion present.
