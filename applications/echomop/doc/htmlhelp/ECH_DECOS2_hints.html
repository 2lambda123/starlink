<P>
 The algorithm used relies on the input frame being in the
 following state (the standard for all ECHOMOP processes).
<P>
<UL>
<LI>No pre-processing has been performed which
    impacts on pixel intensities.
<LI>The Bias has been subtracted.
<LI>The readout-noise is known.
<LI>The ADU-to-electron conversion ratio is known.
</UL>
<P>
 If the above conditions can not be satisfied then the algorithm
 will probably be unable to reliably detect the faintest cosmic
 ray pixels and the acceptance of final fit probability will have
 to be set very low, however, the majority of cosmic ray pixels
 will still be detected and flagged correctly.
<P>
 If you have many `identical' object frames then these may
 be processed together to provide a more reliable cosmic-ray
 rejection.  The script
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
    $ECHOMOP_SOURCE/decos_many
</PRE>
<P>
 provides this facility and should be the preferred method when
 multiple frames are available.
<P>
 The procedure calculates a median image and then rejects pixels
 which deviate by more than n sigma from the median value (note
 that this means that all the frames must be of equal exposure
 time).  Bad pixels are flagged by placing values in the quality
 array of the frame concerned.
