<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>
 This option is used to perform a full 2-D distortion-corrected
 extraction and is provided for cases where the distortion
 of the frame is significant.
<P>
 The option consists of four steps as follows:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
    13.1  Calculate wavelength scale.
<P>
    13.2  Fit 2D polynomials to the distortion.
          A typical interactive plot appears below.

<P>
    13.3  Re-bin the order into a corrected 2-D form.
<P>
    13.4  Extract from the re-binned form.
</PRE>
<P>
 Distortion correction is done on a per-order basis, each order
 having it's own distortions mapped independently.  The distortion
 is modelled by using a tie-point data set composed of the
 positions and wavelength of all identified arc lines in the order.
<P>
 Thus, a wavelength calibration is a pre-requisite to the
 distortion corrected extraction operation.  A 2-D Chebyshev
 polynomial is then fitted to the wavelength deviations of each
 arc line pixel, relative to the wavelength at the trace/arc line
 intersection.  The polynomial is used to generate delta-wavelength
 values at pairs of (X,Y-offset) coordinates:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
    delta-wavelength = 2dPoly( X-pixel, Y-offset from trace )
</PRE>
<P>
 for all X- and all Y-offsets within the dekker.
<P>
 This map of wavelength delta values is then used to drive a
 2-D scrunch of the order into a form where each column (X=nn)
 corresponds to consistent wavelength increment.
<P>
 The final step is to extract the data from this re-binned form.
 The extraction algorithm used is identical to the 1-D case from
 this point on (See 1-D extraction option for more information).
