<P>
 The reduction cycle has been split into a set of steps, most
 of which perform some form of image analysis.  The results of
 these analysis steps provide various models describing the
 features of the image.
<P>
 All these steps take place before any extraction of data from
 the raw image.  The extraction is performed in a single step
 taking into account the previously established data characteristics.
<P>
 This provides for the efficient processing of multiple data frames
 where the same object has been observed, as many of the processing
 steps need only be done once for the first frame of the series.
<P>
 All the discrete processing steps are available as both individual
 tasks (providing efficient execution of single steps), and as
 options from a menu driven control task (providing automatic
 processing and context sensitive assistance).
<P>
 To execute a particular step you can either:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
  - select the appropriate option from the main echmenu menu.
  - type its name at the command line.  For example:
<P>
    % ech_linloc
</PRE>
