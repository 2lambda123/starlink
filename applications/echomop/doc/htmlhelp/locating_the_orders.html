<HR><H2>Locating the Orders</H2><HR>
<P>
 Orders can usually be located completely automatically by ECHOMOP.
 The algorithm takes the central few columns of a the frame and
 cross-correlates them to provide an estimate of the average order
 separation.
<P>
 It then uses this estimate to size a sampling box.  The central
 columns are then re-sampled using averaging and a triangle filter
 to enhance the central peaks.  The resulting data is then searched
 to find the peaks representing the centre of each order.
<P>
 This technique can be severely affected by cosmic rays and other
 high-energy contaminants in the image.  It is recommended that only
 flat-field (or bright object) frames are used to perform order
 location and tracing.
<P>
 In cases where the algorithm cannot locate all the orders which are
 apparent by visual inspection, the orders may be located manually.
 To control this TUNE_AUTLOC=NO  should be set.  In this case ECHOMOP
 will display a graph of the central portion of the frame and wait for
 interactive verification of, or correction to, the located order
 positions.  For cases where the user is confident that the located
 orders will be correct, TUNE_AUTLOC=YES can be specified.
<P>
A typical interactive plot appears below.
