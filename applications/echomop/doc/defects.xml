<date>$Date$</date>

<p>This list contains the current defects list for the ECHOMOP
application.  As well as specific deficiencies, these `defects'
include items which are merely suggestions or TODOs.</p>

<p>If it's not in here, I don't plan to do anything about it.  That
probably means it's slipped through the (unfortunately rather ragged)
net, and you should remind me about it.</p>

<p>These are in chronological order, and some have a higher priority
than others.</p>

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF ELEMENTS IN THIS FILE.
     They're numbered when they're formatted, and it'd be nice to keep
     those numbers correct.

<title>ech_dekker and ech_object apparently yoked together</title>
<p>Michael Albrow:
<blockquote>
<p>When using
echmenu, options "4.1" and "4.2" (these are the tasks ech_dekker and
ech_object)
don't seem to be able to be invoked separately anymore. Instead, trying
either option seems to do the same as option "4" (ech_spatial).</p>

<title>Exporting arc orders</title>
<p>Rachel:
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, I can't seem to export(XP) or import(IM) the arc orders from 
ech_idwave (option 10) so that the arc can be identified using the FIGARO 
command ECHARC. This is the error message I'm getting:

<verbatim>%echarc
>echarc >IMAGE - (IMage) Collapsed echelle arc image to be fitted
>/@ECH_ARC/ >ECH_ECHAR 
>ARCTYPE - (ARctype) Type of arc /'thar'/ >
>UNINITIALISED 
>.Y.LABEL above not order number

<title>Incorrect rounding of pixel values</title>
<p>Pixel numbers in reduction output often seem to have been rounded
to integers!  Possibly only when they've been optimally extracted,
rather than profile extracted.</p>
