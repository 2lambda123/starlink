<date>$Date$</date>

<p>This list contains the current list of defects and issues for
ECHOMOP.  As well as specific deficiencies, these `defects' include
items which are merely suggestions or TODOs.</p>

<p>These are in no particular order, and some have a higher priority
than others.</p>

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF ELEMENTS IN THIS FILE.
     They're numbered when they're formatted, and it'd be nice to keep
     those numbers correct.

<title>ech_dekker and ech_object apparently yoked together</title>
<p>Michael Albrow:
<blockquote>
<p>When using
echmenu, options "4.1" and "4.2" (these are the tasks ech_dekker and
ech_object)
don't seem to be able to be invoked separately anymore. Instead, trying
either option seems to do the same as option "4" (ech_spatial).</p>

<title>Rounding of pixel numbers</title>

<p>ECHOMOP 3.3-4: optimal extraction, as opposed to profile
extraction, seems to round pixel numbers much more often than seems
plausible.</p>

<title>Interface problems</title>

<defect status="open" originator="Rachel North"
originatoremail="rcn@astro.soton.ac.uk" date="12-May-2000">
<title>ech_idwave, XP and IM</title>
<p>Basically, I can't seem to export(XP) or import(IM) the arc orders from 
ech_idwave (option 10) so that the arc can be identified using the FIGARO 
command ECHARC. This is the error message I'm getting:

<verbatim>
%echarc
>echarc >IMAGE - (IMage) Collapsed echelle arc image to be fitted
>/@ECH_ARC/ >ECH_ECHAR 
>ARCTYPE - (ARctype) Type of arc /'thar'/ >
>UNINITIALISED 
>.Y.LABEL above not order number
</verbatim>
</p>

<p>Also, the single order toggle (option 24) doesn't seem to have any effect.
In addition, when I tried to use the AI option of ech_idwave, the program 
crashed...</p>

<p>Finally, when I try and save the scrunched object orders (option 14: 
RESULT_TYPE: SCROBJ) the program crashes out with this message:
<verbatim>
>*** TERMINATING  /star/bin/echomop/echmenu
>*** Received signal 11 SIGSEGV
>Segmentation fault
</verbatim></p>
