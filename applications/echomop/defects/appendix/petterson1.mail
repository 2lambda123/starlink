I can send you some of our data so you can see what we are working with.
Its data we have gathered locally.  I'll send you some compressed FITS
files.

We are able to extract information from the reduction database using the
"convert" package of commands.  This output the data as an ascii file which
we can then feed into other programs.

Below is the file that have been written to do this:

#!/bin/csh -f
#
source /star/etc/cshrc
source /star/etc/login
figaro
convert

foreach file ( $* )
  creobj type=NDF dims=0 object=tempid
  creobj type=ARRAY dims=0 object=tempid.data_array
  copobj source=$file:r".more.echelle.id_lines" \
         object=tempid.data_array.data
  ndf2ascii tempid out=$file:r"idl.asc" fixed noperec=1
  /bin/rm tempid.sdf
  creobj type=NDF dims=0 object=tempid
  creobj type=ARRAY dims=0 object=tempid.data_array
  copobj source=$file:r".more.echelle.id_waves" \
         object=tempid.data_array.data
  ndf2ascii tempid out=$file:r"idw.asc" fixed noperec=1
  /bin/rm tempid.sdf
end


-----------------------------------------------

If you want I can also send my reduction scripts in case there is something
there that might be of use.

I'll send the CCD image files in a separate email.

Regards

Orlon
