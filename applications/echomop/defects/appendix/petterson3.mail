Hi Norman

Part 2, the first file is the RV standard beta aqr, like all the files it
has already been preprocessed and dark subtracted so is ready to go.  The
second file is a composite flat image made from several images.

Hope this goes a long way to recreating the line identification problems.

Regards

Orlon
