Norman took over maintenance of ECHOMOP in late 1998.

Only in late-ish 2000 did I get around to much of a reorganisation of
the source, and importing it properly into CVS.  The source is all in
a single big directory, along with the SUN documentation, and the HTML
version of the help.  As well, there was a separate collection of web
pages from Martin Clayton.  This is a mess, but doing much
reorganisation would require major reworking of the makefile, which I
can't face just now.

The HTML help appears to be generated from the echomop.hlp file, but
I don't think I have the processing tool here.

I don't have the sources for SC/3 and SG/9, which were also written by
Martin Clayton.

I think I've tidied it all up, but because of the change in structure,
I need more work to get it to build and package up.  I've got a bundle
of ECHOMOP bug reports now, so I need to do _something_ with it.

Structure
---------

Echomop is wierd.  I'm having great difficulty understanding how the
menu works.

When you start up, echmono.f gets the `action' and passes it to
echomop.f.  This goes through a dirty great big IF, and sets
AUTO_OPTIONS to some sequence of menu selections, such as '6,EXIT' for
ech_sky and '14,EXIT' for ech_result.  This turns auto_options into a
numeric OPTION, by a very convoluted route, and then (from line 685)
starts testing the value of the string option_module(option).  After
that (around 814), it calls CALL ECH_ECHOMOP_OPTION
(OPTION_MODULE(OPTION), ORDER_NUMBER, STATUS).  Thus option_module()
maps numbers to strings, and is initialised in ech_initialise.f (hard
to find!).  ech_echomop_option then has _another_ big IF, and calls
routines from there.

Thus after option 4, ech_spatial, is invoked, option_module
refers to Submenu_2, which points to ech_get_slit_extent and
ech_get_obj_profile.

The keywords recognised in ech_echomop_option are:

ECH_2D_EXT_OPT
ECH_CHECK_FRAME
ECH_COUNT_ORDERS
ECH_DECOSMIC_1
ECH_DECOSMIC_1
ECH_DECOSMIC_2
ECH_DETERMINE_SLOPE
ECH_DISABLE_ORDER
ECH_EXT_OPT
ECH_EXTR_QUICK
ECH_EXTR_QUICK
ECH_FIT_2D_DISTORTION
ECH_FIT_ORDER_TRACE
ECH_FIT_REF_FWHMS
ECH_FLATTEN_ORDERS
ECH_FLATTEN_YBLAZE
ECH_FLATTEN_YBLAZE
ECH_GEN_REBIN_SCALE
ECH_GEN_REBIN_SCALE
ECH_GET_OBJ_PROFILE
ECH_GET_REF_FWHM
ECH_GET_SLIT_EXTENT
ECH_GET_STAR_PROFILE
ECH_IMAGE_COSMIC
ECH_IMAGE_TRACE
ECH_LOCATE_ORDERS
ECH_LOCATE_REF_LINES
ECH_MODEL_BACK
ECH_MODEL_FLAT
ECH_MODEL_PROFILE
ECH_MODEL_SKY
ECH_MODEL_SSKY
ECH_MULTI_MERGE
ECH_MULTI_MERGE
ECH_NORMAL_YBLAZE

ECH_POLY_PROFILE
ECH_REBIN_ARCORDER
ECH_REBIN_ORDER
ECH_SCRUNCH_ARC
ECH_SCRUNCH_OBJ
ECH_SCRUNCH_STAR
ECH_SET_PARAMETER
ECH_SET_PARAMETER
ECH_SET_PARAMETER
ECH_SET_PARAMETER
ECH_TRACE_CONSISTENCY
ECH_WAVE_CONSISTENCY
ECH_WAVELENGTH_CALIB
ECH_WAVELENGTH_CALIB
ECH_WRITE_RESULTS

these typically, but not always, call a routine with the same name.

ECHOMOP builds OK, as long as I reuse the sun152.htx_tar tarball I
inherited.  Because of some fancy postprocessing, I'm unable to run
star2html on the documentation source.  At some point, I might convert
this to SGML rather than fight with star2html.

26-Sep-2000
-----------

I put everything into CVS, more or less properly, but with a certain
amount of faffing around as I swithered about rearranging the source
(with the result that there's an .../echelle/ directory in the
repository which was an abortive attempt at this).  I made and
committed some changes to the makefile, but it wasn't until
26-Sep-2000 (18:08) that I got around to tagging the initial state: I
used `cvs rtag start echomop', and it warned me that aaa_indexing.f,
ech_plotter.f and makefile already had that tag on them and it wasn't
moving it.  That probably meant that exporting the stuff tagged with
`start' won't produce _exactly_ the initial state, but it'll be close
enough.

I've been fiddling with the echomop web pages fairly ad lib., fixing
up broken references and the like.  It's probably now in a reasonably
stable state, and I can start working on it.

20-Jan-2002
-----------

Bit the bullet and removed the failed
CVS/starlink/{echomop-old,echelle} directories from the repository.

It turns out that it's easy to build the documentation, using the
preprocessing script included in sun152.tex, so that was
added to the doc/sun152/Makefile.  So I don't need to hang on to the
sun152.htx_tar tarball.

Fiddled with the documentation, updating dates and little more.


25-Jan-2002
-----------

The Bug: it's something to do with SLITIM, since it appears that the
bug consists of being reprompted for SLITIM each time round (though
this has yet to be confirmed):
    SLITIM - Frame for dekker measurement /''/ > test_flat
but grepping for SLITIM doesn't show up anything obvious.  Hmm, I
think that SLITIM is the IMAGE passed to ech_get_profile and thence to 
ech_spatial_profile and ech_spatial_avgprof, but
where does it come from?  ech_setup_object_ref, perhaps?  But then
where's the link to the SLITIM parameter made?  Ooooh.

No, I don't think it _is_ anything to do with SLITIM.  I think the
problem after all this time was to do with the twisted option-parsing
code in echomop.f, so that suboptions were never being recognised.  I
created ech_parse_option.c, and now things _seem_ to work.  I'll
release this as 3.3-6b1 and see if anyone breaks it.



Things it would be nice to do
-----------------------------

Make a bash version of the initialisation and demo scripts
(echomop.csh and echomop_demo.tar).

Some conflicts between documentation and actual files.  For
example, ech_demo.txt doesn't exist.  Done, 20-Jan-2002.

Demo uses more, but this should be changed to `more -w', so that the
demo doesn't fly through the demo when the displayed text is less than
a pageful.  Fixed.

In the demo, the ech_idwave demonstration produces an error: 

  !! SUBPAR: Keyword TUNE_WCAL_INDEX is not defined in the interface file
  !  Application exit status SUBPAR__CMDSYER, syntax error in command line

Problem: Alison Ford <af@astro.keele.ac.uk>, 16 December.
False claim of no more disk space
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I looked through ech_write_results.f, which was one of the two
routines implicated, but couldn't find anything obviously amiss.  Not
entirely surprising, since there seems to be a panoply of different
ways to save files, any one of which could have a wrinkle.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem: Michael Albrow <phys170@cantua.canterbury.ac.nz>, 1 Feb 1999.
ech_dekker and ech_object apparently yoked together
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should be easy to fix.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem: Ignacio Negueruela <ignacio@tocai.sdc.asi.it>, 4 May 1999.
Seems to be a ripple superimposed on the continuum (sounds nasty...)
