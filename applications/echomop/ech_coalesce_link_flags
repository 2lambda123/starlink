#  Name:
#     ech_coalesce_link_flags

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking echmono
#     Note, this is for use when building the application; it is not
#     installed, and is not intended for general use.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by the ECHOMOP makefile alone.
#     The arguments generated are written to the standard output.
#     The awk magic below is based on the various *_link scripts, originally
#     written by RFWS.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a compiler command line,
#     such as:
#
#        f77 -o program -L/star/lib `ech_coalesce_link_flags pgp_link one_link_adam` program.f
