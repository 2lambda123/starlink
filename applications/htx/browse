#  Name:
#     browse

#  Purpose:
#     Display a document using a WWW browser.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Invocation:
#        browse doc
#     or cat doc | browse

#  Description:
#     This script displays a document using a WWW browser. If necessary, it
#     starts a new invocation of the browser. Otherwise, it uses an existing
#     one and passes the document to it by "remote control".
#
#     Documents may be specified using URLs or local file names, or temporary
#     documents may be given by supplying their contents (in HTML format)
#     on standard input. These options are controlled by the setting of the
#     HTX_WHERE environment variable.

#  Parameters:
#     doc
#        The optional specification of the document to be displayed, given
#        either as a URL or the name of a local file which is accessible to the
#        browser.

#  Notes:
#     -  Subject to the limitations imposed by each browser, this script
#     attempts to use the most appropriate current browser invocation for
#     displaying documents.
#     -  It also attempts to manage temporary file space used to store any
#     documents read from standard input.

#  Implementation Deficiencies:
#     -  Management of temporary files is somewhat imperfect due to the
#     difficulty of knowing when the browser has finished with them. The
#     strategy adopted is to leave the last 3 of these around but to remove
#     older ones whenever a new one is created (the configuration files used
#     by Mosaic are handled somewhat more precisely than this, however).
#     -  In the case of Mosaic, temporary files are associated with a specific
#     browser process ID, so it is possible to periodically determine if the
#     associated browser has been stopped and remove all unnecessary files.
#     With Netscape, however, the process ID is not known (it could be running
#     on another machine) so some files will generally be left around. The
#     main objective in this case is simply to prevent the number of files
#     growing without limit.

#  Environment Variables Used:
#     HTX_BROWSER
#        This should be used to select the web browser to be used
#        to view documents.  The variable should contain a string corresponding
#        to one of the supported WWW browsers (currently firefox,
#        mozilla, netscape and Mosaic) in order that the browser
#        being used can be recognised. If this variable is not
#        defined, then each of the browsers will be checked: see
#        findbrowser for the priority used.  If it is not recognised,
#        then an error will result.  On Mac OS X the system default
#        browser will be used if HTX_BROWSER is not set; if it is
#        set, it should be set to the application name of the chosen
#        browser (eg, 'Safari'), not a path.
#     HTX_SCRIPT
#        The name of the script originally invoked by the user. This is used
#        in the generation of warning and error messages.
#     HTX_TMP
#        The name of the directory in which to create temporary communication
#        files. If this variable is not set, or is null, $HOME/.htxtmp is used
#        instead.
#     HTX_TTY
#        The name of the controlling terminal. This may be needed on some
#        systems if a document is being read from standard input, because the
#        Starlink "xdisplay" utility may examine standard input to identify
#        the terminal. If given, and not null, HTX_TTY is supplied to
#        "xdisplay" in place of standard input.
#     HTX_WARN
#        If this has the value '1', then any warning messages generated by
#        the browser (e.g. during startup) will be written to standard error.
#        Otherwise, these warnings will be suppressed.
#     HTX_WHERE
#        -  If this has the value "l", then the "doc" parameter is interpreted
#        as the name of a local file.
#        -  If it has the value "i", the document contents (in HTML format)
#        will be read from standard input by this script and stored in a
#        temporary file for access by the browser.
#        -  If it has neither of these values, the "doc" argument is
#        interpreted as a URL.

#  History:
#     17-OCT-1995 (RFWS):
#        Original version.
#     5-JAN-1998 (RFWS):
#        Made Netscape the default browser.
#     5-JAN-1998 (RFWS):
#        Fixed problems with openFILE no longer working properly in Netscape.
#     6-JAN-1998 (RFWS):
#        Use HTX_TMP for temporary communication files.
#     6-JAN-1998 (RFWS):
#        Re-define standard input to be ${HTX_TTY} for "xdisplay" if possible.
#     29-OCT-2003 (SER)
#        Added Mozilla. Fixed bug for Solaris when starting
#        netscape (redirection command for sh).
#     17-MAY-2004 (SER)
#        Added Netscape 7.1 code (same as Mozilla). Made some alterations
#        with "file://". The file:// part of the url is now added in the
#        urlgen and showme scripts.
#     9-SEP-2004 (BEC)
#        Added support for OS X by opening URLs and HTML files with "open".
#     7-JUN-2005 (SER)
#        Added support for Firefox, just a copy of Mozilla setup. Will need
#        testing.
#     9-MAY-2006 (PWD):
#        Changed to use find_browser script so that a list of preferred
#        browsers can be used as the default.
#     9-MAY-2006 (TIMJ):
#        OSX ignores all the clever stuff and calls the Apple "open"
#        command directly. If HTX_BROWSER is not set the default browser
#        is used.
#     10-MAY-2006 (PWD):
#        Merge all netscape, mozilla and firefox code into one.
#     8-JAN-2008 (PWD):
#        Use SUSV3 "tail -n +3" command, "tail +3" is non-standard.
#     19-JAN-2010 (PWD):
#        Add provisional support for google-chrome. Remove cruft checking if
#        DISPLAY variable is set. No longer needed as X should be secure now
#        and not bypass that.
