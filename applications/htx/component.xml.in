  <description>Hypertext Cross-reference Utilities</description>
  <abstract>
  <p>This document describes a set of ``Hypertext Cross-Reference
  Utilities'' (HTX) which are designed to help maintain large
  documentation sets whose constituent documents are written using the
  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
  </p>
  <p>The central part of HTX is a hypertext linker, hlink. This allows
  hyper-links (or cross-references) to be established between related
  documents in such a way that it is easy to maintain their integrity as
  individual documents are updated. Information produced by this linking
  process is also used by other HTX utilities to provide document search
  facilities and the ability to randomly access any part of a documentation
  set. This latter capability forms a basis for constructing hypertext
  help systems for use by other software.
  </p>
  <p>The expected readership of this document includes those who read hypertext
  documentation, those who write it, and those who maintain it, especially
  those who write and maintain Starlink documentation. Software developers
  may also be interested in the possibilities for hypertext help that
  HTX provides.
