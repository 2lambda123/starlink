#  Name:
#     findbrowser

#  Purpose:
#     Find a suitable browser for HTX.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This script returns the name of a supported browser on the PATH, 
#     unless the environment variable HTX_BROWSER is already defined, 
#     in which case it returns the value of that. The supported browsers
#     are checked using a priority list, which may need to be updated 
#     from time-to-time.

#  Invocation:
#        HTX_BROWSER=`findbrowser`

#  Environment Variables Used:
#     HTX_BROWSER
#        An optional command which will be used to invoke the WWW browser.
#        This should contain a string corresponding to one of the supported
#        WWW browsers (firefox, mozilla, netscape, safari and mosaic).

#  Notes: 
#     Both the PATH and HTX_BROWSER variables may contain spaces in the
#     path names. 
#
#     It returns an error message for wrapping in a context if it cannot find
#     any browsers.
#
#     We avoid using 'which', which doesn't return a useful exit status on
#     some platforms.  A possible alternative would be 'command -v' but
#     that isn't POSIX (though we don't know of any platforms where it
#     doesn't work).
