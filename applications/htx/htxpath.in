#  Name:
#     htxpath

#  Purpose:
#     Output the default list of directories to be searched for documents.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This script writes a colon-separated list of directories which specifies
#     the default sequence of locations to be searched for hypertext documents
#     to standard output.

#  Invocation:
#     htxpath

#  Environment Variables Used:
#     The script outputs the value of:
#
#       "$INSTALL/docs:$INSTALL/help:$INSTALL/starjava/docs:$STARLINK/docs:$STARLINK/help:$STARLINK/starjava/docs"
#
#     where the environment variable INSTALL defaults to "$HOME/star" and
#     the environment variable STARLINK defaults to "/star" if not defined.
#     If $INSTALL and $STARLINK have the same value, then the first half of
#     this search path is omitted.
#
#     If this script has been installed using the HTX makefile, this value
#     will be "hard-wired" into this script during installation, and will
#     therefore reflect the values of $INSTALL, $STARLINK and $HOME at the
#     time of installation. If it has not been installed (e.g. during software
#     development), then these variables will be translated at the time the
#     script is invoked.
#
#     The above is still true, but if the environment variable STARLINK_DIR is
#     defined it will be used as the value of STARLINK, rather than the baked
#     in version. This allows the whole tree of documents to be relocated
#     following the standard fashion for the applications.

#  Notes:
#     The value of the environment variable HTX_PATH (if defined and not null)
#     should normally be used to override the default provided by this script.

#  The following lines should be edited to define the values used during
#  software installation.
      install='|INSTALL|'
      starlink='|STARLINK|'

#  Test if the above edits have been made. If not, then provide defaults.
      if test "${install}" = '|INS''TALL|'; then
         install="${INSTALL:-${HOME}/star}"
      fi
      if test "${starlink}" = '|STAR''LINK|'; then
         starlink="${STARLINK:-/star}"
      fi

#  Test if STARLINK_DIR is defined. That overrides any STARLINK value.
      if test "$STARLINK_DIR" != ""; then
         starlink="${STARLINK_DIR}"
      fi

#  If "install" and "starlink" have the same values, then output a simplified
#  search path.
      if test "${install}" = "${starlink}"; then
         echo "${starlink}/docs:${starlink}/help:${starlink}/starjava/docs"

#  Otherwise, output the full search path.
