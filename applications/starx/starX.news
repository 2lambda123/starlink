 This is the news file for the starX environment package.

 StarX is the X11 library link-compatability package to allow system
 independent linking against the X11 libraries.  This system allows
 for system dependencies in the X11 link requirements, particularly for
 Solaris 2.4 and above.

 It should be built in the Starlink Software Environment Library system,
 before any systems that require X11 linking.
