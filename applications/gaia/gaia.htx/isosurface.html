    <p>
      Using this window you can view 3D surfaces that represent the same data
      value throughout a data-cube, these are called iso-surfaces. Each
      iso-surface, as well as having a data level, has a colour and an
      opacity. Using opacity allows you to see one surface within another. An
      opacity of 1 is completely opaque and 0 transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible to add iso-surfaces from 
      <a href="extracubes.html">other cubes</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>Defining levels</h3>
    <p>
      The simplest way to define levels is to select the <tt>Generate</tt> tab
      and press the <tt>Generate</tt> button. This will guess three levels
      that present typical data in the currently viewed image (not
      cube). Generation can also be based on percentile levels within the
      image, or by using magnitude intervals. You can of course just type in
      values directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are defining more than one level you should make sure that the
      opacities chosen run in the same direction as the levels (assuming you
      have positive data), that ensures that you can see inside the outermost
      surface (hint start at level 0 with your highest value). Using the same
      opacity for all levels sometimes works well, but when the levels and
      opacities run opposite to each other you will see confusing effects (the
      drawing order for isophotes is from level 0). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you have some levels press <tt>Draw</tt> to see the rendered scene.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default the levels you give are sorted into increasing order before
      being drawn. This makes sure (for positive data) that inner surfaces are
      drawn before outer ones. To switch this behaviour off toggle the
      <tt>Options->Sort levels</tt> menu item.
    </p>

    <h3>Interacting with the scene</h3>

    <h4>Mouse and keyboard interactions</h4>
    <h5>Lost in space?</h5>
    <p>
      If you can no longer see any graphics then try pressing the <tt>r</tt>
      key. That resets scene to view all the data.
    </p>
    <h5>Mousing</h5>
    <p>
      There are two modes of mouse interaction, joystick and trackerball,
      these are position sensitive and motion sensitive modes. In joystick
      mode, the default, motion of the scene occurs as long as a button is
      pressed, in trackerball mode you need to press a button and move the
      mouse as well.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>Button 1</tt>: rotates the scene. The rotation is in the direction
        defined from the centre of the scene towards the current mouse
        position. In joystick mode the speed of rotation is proportional to
        the distance from the centre. If the <tt>Control</tt> key is also
        pressed the scene rolls about the centre.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>Button 2</tt>: pan the scene. In joystick mode the pan motion
        continues until the mouse is released.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>Button 3</tt>: zoom the scene. Zoom in if the mouse position is in
        the top-half of the scene, zoom out if in the bottom half. In joystick
        mode the amount of zoom is determined by the distance from the
        horizontal centre line.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>Scroll-wheel</tt>: the scroll-wheel of a mouse will zoom the scene
        in and out.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Keys</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>7</tt>: toggle the window into and out of stereo mode. Requires
        red-blue glasses or other hardware support.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>j/t</tt>: toggle between the two mousing modes, joystick and
        trackerball.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>f</tt>: fly to the point under the cursor. Also sets the rotation
          centre.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>r</tt>: reset the scene so that everything is visible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>s</tt>: change representation of scene to surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>w</tt>: change representation of scene to wireframe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>1</tt>,<tt>2</tt>,<tt>3</tt>: reorient the scene so that axis 1, 2
        or 3 points out of the screen. Also aligns the other axes so that they
        are parallel to the window edges.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Arrow Keys</h5>
    <p>
      The <tt>Up/Down/Left/Right</tt> keys rotate the scene. Combining with
      <tt>Control</tt> slows the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>Shift-Up/Down</tt> keys zoom the scene in and out. Combining with
      <tt>Control</tt> slows the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>Alt-Up/Down/Left/Right</tt> keys pans the scene.
      Combining with <tt>Control</tt> slows the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>Shift-Left/Right</tt> keys roll the scene about the centre.
      Combining with <tt>Control</tt> slows the movement.
    </p>

    <h3>Interacting with GAIA</h3>
    <h4>The image plane</h4>
    <p>
      To view the position of the current slice that is displayed in GAIA you
      must enable the <tt>Image plane</tt>, do this by ticking the
      checkbutton. This draws a 2D image in the correct position. If you now
      change the index of the plane in the image sections toolbox this will
      move to reflect the new position, as will the image slice displayed in
      the main window (this is best seen on a machine with dual monitors). You
      can also move the plane itself and changes to its position will be
      reflected elsewhere (like an extracted spectrum), to do this you press
      and hold the middle mouse button somewhere over the image plane (not the
      edges, they have other interactions) and move the mouse. <b>Note</b>
      when the image plane is displayed the mouse interactions described above
      that control the scene are overridden, you need to move off the image
      plane to regain these (hint: use the keyboard interactions when working
      at high zooms).
    </p>
    <p>
      To change the extraction axis do the same interaction at the edges, this
      will rotate the image plane and snap to the nearest axis on release
      (when you press the middle button on the image plane an inner blue box
      is drawn, you need to press outside this).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is limited control over the opacity of the image plane in the
      <tt>Options->Image plane opacity</tt> menu. This allows you to make it
      see-through, so all the parts of the volume can be seen, or make it
      completely clear (in which case you see just an outline of its position,
      but note the mouse interactions will be disabled by this choice).
    <p>
    <p>
      Another option is to choose a colour table for the image plane.
    </p>
    <h4>The spectral extraction</h4>
    <p>
      To view the position of the extracted spectrum (if one has been
      extracted, you must do that first by clicking on the main image), you
      need to enable the <tt>Spectral line</tt> by ticking the
      checkbutton. The position of this line will be updated as you drag
      around on the main image. To move the line within the scene you press
      mouse button 1 on the image plane (which must also be enabled) and drag
      around. Note that this action also reports the current coordinates and
      data value at that point on the image plane in the cube.
    </p>

    <h3>Determining the directions</h3>
    <p>
      When rotating a cube it's easy to become disoriented and loose the
      directions of the celestial and dispersion axes. To see this enable the
      <tt>Direction axes</tt>, which draws an set of arrow lines pointing in
      the directions of the world coordinate axes (not the cube axes, RA and
      Dec are not necessarily aligned with those). These will remain
      permanently in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      For presentation purposes a set of annotated axes can be labeled and
      drawn using the <tt>Annotated axes</tt> checkbutton (this is drawn by the
      AST subroutine library). If the labels become reversed so you cannot
      read them just redraw the scene.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting a hardcopy</h3>
    <p>
      You save a copy of the current scene to TIFF, JPEG, PNG and EPS formats
      using the <tt>File->Print</tt> dialog. Make sure that the window is
      uncovered and fully drawn before using this.
    </p>

    <h3>Handling bad data</h3>
    <p>
      If your NDF data contain bad values, then you may need to replace these
      with some other value before you can successfully contour. For
      iso-surface work, unlike <a href="volume.html">volume rendering</a>, this
      will not generally be needed, so the default is to not replace bad
      values.  If you do need to do this then the downside of this is that a
      copy of your data is made. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The position for FITS data is more complicated, but much of the above
      applies to those as well. The greater complication is that FITS data has
      a fixed byte order (bigendian), so for some machines (notably those with
      Intel processors) the overhead of creating a copy cannot be avoided.
