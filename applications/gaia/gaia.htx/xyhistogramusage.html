    <p>
      This window displays a histogram of the image data bounded by the
      rectangle that you have drawn on the image. Normally this is with the
      data limits of the main image, but you can optionally use all the data
      range using the "Options->Use data limits" option.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other feature to control the histogram creation is the "Binning
      factor". This value represents the fraction of total counts that should
      be found in at least one bin, so increasing it will increase the bin
      width, but only if the default histogram requires this (the default
      histogram is based on the data range, displayed or complete, and 2048
      bins).
    </p>
    <p>
      The intensity and peak values are shown, along with an interactive
      readout of the intensity and count under the pointer and parabolic and
      gaussian fits (when using the full data range these fits are to a
      selected portion of that, the expectation being that a peak in the
      background will be found and that should be analysed).
    </p>

    <p>
      Other options include the ability to stop the histogram from being
      constantly updated when you move the rectangle, which is the
      <tt>continuous updates</tt> item (when this is switched off updates only
      happen when you release the rectangle), switched off is the default,
      note you can force an update by pressing the "Refresh" button.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <tt>Print...</tt> option will produce a dialog which allows you to
      print the histogram to a file or printer.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the "File" menu you can find an option to save the histogram as a
      text file to disk. This is just a simple format with two columns of
      data.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are various colour and line thickness items in the
      <tt>Options</tt> menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to have more than one histogram choose the <tt>New
      window</tt> item in the <tt>File</tt> menu to have an independent
      window, or pick the "Display previous histogram option" (only make's
      sense when the continuouos update option is disabled).
