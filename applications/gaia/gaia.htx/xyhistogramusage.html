    <p>This window displays a histogram of the image data bounded by the
    rectangle that you have drawn on the image. It also displays the intensity
    and count of the peak value and the limits of the rectangle drawn over the
    main image, as well as providing an interactive readout of the intensity
    and count.
    </p>

    <p>Options include the ability to stop the histogram from being constantly
    updated when you move the rectangle, which is the <tt>continuous
    updates</tt> item (when this is switched off updates only happend when you
    release the rectangle) 
    </p>

    <p>The <tt>Print...</tt> option will produce a dialog which allows you to
    print the histogram to a file or printer.
    </p>

    <p> There are various colour and line thickness items in the
    <tt>Options</tt> menu.
    </p>

    <p>If you want to have more than one histogram choose the 
      <tt>New window</tt> item in the <tt>File</tt> menu.
