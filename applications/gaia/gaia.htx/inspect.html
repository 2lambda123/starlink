<br>
<p>The simplest way to view your data values is by simply moving the
cursor over the region of interest and then reading off the value
shown in the control panel (in the "Value:" readout). Zooming and the
zoom window helps you position your cursor accurately. Greater
accuracy can be obtained by using the up and down arrow keys to move
the cursor (this only works when the focus is on the main image, click
on the main image if the arrow keys don't seem to work).

<h3>Viewing a slice through the image:</h3>
<p>To view a slice through the image open the "View" menu and select the
"Spectrum..." option. This allows you to draw a line on the canvas and
then shows the image data values along the line. The line can then be
moved and resized and the slice will be updated in real time. You move
the line by placing the mouse cursor over it and pressing button 1
(this "selects" the line). If you hold the button down and move the
mouse the line with move with the mouse. You can tell if the object is
selected when little boxes, known as the selection grips, appear at
its ends. If you drag one of the grips the end of the line will
follow.

<h3>View the image data values in pixels about the cursor:</h3>
<p>Open menu "View" and select the "Pixel Table..." option. This raises a
sub-menu from which you should select a size. This size is the side of
the box in which the image data values will be shown. Larger values
will be slower to update.

<h3>Getting a histogram of a region</h3> 
<p>This can be done using the 
<a href="xyhistogramusage.html">"Histogram of XY region..."</a>
option in the "Image-Analysis" menu. Follow the link for more details.
