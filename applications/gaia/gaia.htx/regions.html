<p>The image regions toolbox allows you to draw overlay shapes on your
image and then either extract or remove them, putting the results into
a new temporary image (which will be displayed in a new window by
default), or you can get basic statistics about the pixel values in
the regions.

<p>The regions that are drawn can also be saved into simple text files
and either redrawn (by re-reading the file) or used with other "ARD"
aware programs (ARD stands for Ascii Region Definition), such as found
in the Starlink packages KAPPA (SUN/95) and CCDPACK (SUN/139).

<p>To activate the toolbox select the "Image regions..." item in the
"Image-Analysis" menu of window displaying your image.

<p>Some help with using the toolbox is available.
