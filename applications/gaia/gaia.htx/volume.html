    <p>
      Using this window you can view all the data in a cube between two data
      limits as a single volume. Each value is given a colour based on the
      current colour choice and an opacity running linearly from zero to one
      (minimum to maximum data value).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible to add iso-surfaces from 
      <a href="extracubes.html">other cubes</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>Data limits</h3>
    <p>
      The data limits should encompass a range that covers the data values of
      interest. Default values are chosen based on the values in the currently
      displayed slice. To define your own limits just type in the values in
      the <tt>Min value</tt> and <tt>Max value</tt> fields and press
      </tt>Draw</tt>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Colours</h3>
    <p>
      The colour choice is made in two ways, either by selecting two colours
      to represent the high and low data values (linear interpolation in RGB
      is used to determine colours for data values between these limits), or
      by choosing a colour map (these are the same as used for images). Colour
      choice is clearly a matter of aesthetics. To choose a colour map just
      untick the <tt>Two colour</tt> checkbutton and select the <tt>Colour
      map</tt> menu.
    </p>

    <h3>Handling bad data</h3>
    <p>
      If your NDF data contain bad values, then you will probably need to
      replace these with some other value before you can successfully volume
      render (as each pixel along a line of sight is considered these odd
      numbers, which cannot be just ignored as usual, will have an
      effect). This is why the default operation of this toolbox (unlike the
      <a href="isosurface.html">isosurface</a> version) is to replace bad
      values with the value zero. The downside of this is that a copy of your
      data is made. If you know that your data do not have any bad pixels, or
      the bad value doesn't cause any rendering problems then choose not to do
      this by unticking the <tt>Replace bad</tt> checkbutton before pressing
      <tt>Draw</tt>. Clearly this is more important for larger cubes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position for FITS data is more complicated, but much of the above
      applies to those as well. The greater complication is that FITS data has
      a fixed byte order (bigendian), so for some machines (notably those with
      Intel processors) the overhead of creating a copy cannot be avoided.

    <h3>Interacting with the scene</h3>

    <h4>Mouse and keyboard interactions</h4>
    <h5>Lost in space?</h5>
    <p>
      If you can no longer see any graphics then try pressing the <tt>r</tt>
      key. That resets scene to view all the data.
    </p>
    <h5>Mousing</h5>
    <p>
      There are two modes of mouse interaction, joystick and trackerball,
      these are position sensitive and motion sensitive modes. In joystick
      mode, the default, motion of the scene occurs as long as a button is
      pressed, in trackerball mode you need to press a button and move the
      mouse as well.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>Button 1</tt>: rotates the scene. The rotation is in the direction
        defined from the centre of the scene towards the current mouse
        position. In joystick mode the speed of rotation is proportional to
        the distance from the centre. If the <tt>Control</tt> key is also
        pressed the scene rolls about the centre.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>Button 2</tt>: pan the scene. In joystick mode the pan motion
        continues until the mouse is released.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>Button 3</tt>: zoom the scene. Zoom in if the mouse position is in
        the top-half of the scene, zoom out if in the bottom half. In joystick
        mode the amount of zoom is determined by the distance from the
        horizontal centre line.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>Scroll-wheel</tt>: the scroll-wheel of a mouse will zoom the scene
        in and out.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      During mouse events the level of detail shown in the display will
      decrease to maintain an acceptable level of interaction. The fuller
      resolution should return when interactions stop (if not just press the
      <tt>Draw</tt> button to refresh the screen).
    </p>


    <h5>Keys</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>3</tt>: toggle the window into and out of stereo mode. Requires
        red-blue glasses or other hardware support.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>j/t</tt>: toggle between the two mousing modes, joystick and
        trackerball.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>f</tt>: fly to the point under the cursor. Also sets the rotation
          centre.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>r</tt>: reset the scene so that everything is visible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>s</tt>: change representation of scene to surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>w</tt>: change representation of scene to wireframe.
      </li>

      <li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Arrow Keys</h5>
    <p>
      The <tt>Up/Down/Left/Right</tt> keys rotate the scene. Combining with
      <tt>Control</tt> slows the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>Shift-Up/Down</tt> keys zoom the scene in and out. Combining with
      <tt>Control</tt> slows the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>Alt-Up/Down/Left/Right</tt> keys pans the scene.
      Combining with <tt>Control</tt> slows the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>Shift-Left/Right</tt> keys roll the scene about the centre.
      Combining with <tt>Control</tt> slows the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that during these events the level of detail shown in the display
      will remain set to the highest value, unlike for mouse events. 
    </p>

    <h3>Interacting with GAIA</h3>
    <h4>The image plane</h4>
    <p>
      To view the position of the current slice that is displayed in GAIA you
      must enable the <tt>Image plane</tt>, do this by ticking the
      checkbutton. This draws a 2D image in the correct position. If you now
      change the index of the plane in the image sections toolbox this will
      move to reflect the new position, as will the image slice displayed in
      the main window (this is best seen on a machine with dual monitors). You
      can also move the plane itself and changes to its position will be
      reflected elsewhere (like an extracted spectrum), to do this you press
      and hold the middle mouse button somewhere over the image plane (not the
      edges, they have other interactions) and move the mouse. <b>Note</b>
      when the image plane is displayed the mouse interactions described above
      that control the scene are overridden, you need to move off the image
      plane to regain these (hint: use the keyboard interactions when working
      at high zooms).
    </p>
    <p>
      To change the extraction axis do the same interaction at the edges, this
      will rotate the image plane and snap to the nearest axis on release
      (when you press the middle button on the image plane an inner blue box
      is drawn, you need to press outside this).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is limited control over the opacity of the image plane in the
      <tt>Options->Image plane opacity</tt> menu. This allows you to make it
      see-through, so all the parts of the volume can be seen, or make it
      completely clear (in which case you see just an outline of its position,
      but note the mouse interactions will be disabled by this choice).
    <p>
    <p>
      Another option is to choose a colour table for the image plane.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>The spectral extraction</h4>
    <p>
      To view the position of the extracted spectrum (if one has been
      extracted, you must do that first by clicking on the main image), you
      need to enable the <tt>Spectral line</tt> by ticking the
      checkbutton. The position of this line will be updated as you drag
      around on the main image. To move the line within the scene you press
      mouse button 1 on the image plane (which must also be enabled) and drag
      around. Note that this action also reports the current coordinates and
      data value at that point on the image plane in the cube.
    </p>

    <h3>Determining the directions</h3>
    <p>
      When rotating a cube it's easy to become disoriented and loose the
      directions of the celestial and dispersion axes. To see this enable the
      <tt>Direction axes</tt>, which draws an set of arrow lines pointing in
      the directions of the world coordinate axes (not the cube axes, RA and
      Dec are not necessarily aligned with those). These will remain
      permanently in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      For presentation purposes a set of annotated axes can be labeled and
      drawn using the <tt>Annotated axes</tt> checkbutton (this is drawn by the
      AST subroutine library). If the labels become reversed so you cannot
      read them just redraw the scene.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting a hardcopy</h3>
    <p>
      You save a copy of the current scene to TIFF, JPEG, PNG and EPS formats
      using the <tt>File->Print</tt> dialog. Make sure that the window is
      uncovered and fully drawn before using this. For a better drawing with
      fewer artifacts switch on the <tt>High resolution</tt> item in the
      <tt>Options</tt> menu.
    </p>
