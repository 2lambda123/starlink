    <p>
      If your image has a world coordinate system associated with it, you can
      query the ESO catalogue of HST guide stars about any located within the
      bounds of your image. These will then be listed and plotted over your
      image.  Similarly you can query the NED (NASA/IPAC Extragalactic
      Database) and SIMBAD databases and see lists of all the objects that
      they know about on your image. To see the full list of available
      SkyCat-format catalogues, look at the "Browse Catalog Directories..."
      item in the "Data-Servers" menu.

      Just for reference the catalogues shown in the "Catalogs" sub-menu are
      only a default set loaded from a local configuration file (you can add
      entries to this list using the "Add" button). Entries in the list that
      are shown as type "directory", should be expanded by pressing the
      associated plus sign (the names in this lists are returned from the
      remote server).
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also display an image returned directly from the Digital Sky
      Survey (and then perform queries in other catalogues about this
      field). Named objects from certain catalogues can have their full
      information displayed in a web browser and may even have bibliography
      links to the ADS abstract service.  Finally the HST archives are also
      available. Using these you can see what observations have been made of
      any objects on your image (and preview any generally available).
    </p>

    <p>
      Usage hints for the windows that actually display the catalogues are
      available:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="query.html">Catalogue query windows usage hints</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It also has facilities for obtaining images (from the DSS) and for
      finding out about any previous observations made by HST, NNT and the
      CFHT.
    </p>

    <h3>Remote catalogues</h3>
    <p>
      Remote catalogues are obtained from specially configured data-centres.
      Typically these data-centres return object coordinates (as Right
      Ascension and Declination) together with other useful information, such
      as magnitudes and possibly links to bibliographic (ADS) and archive
      (HST, NNT and CFHT) details.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main services used by GAIA and Skycat are provided by ESO, CADC
      and LEDAS.

      To see a list of all the catalogues available select the "Browse
      Catalog Directories..." item in the "Data-Servers" menu. This should
      reveal a window containing a directory-like listing of all the
      catalogues. Those marked with type "directory" may be expanded to show
      their full contents by pressing the plus sign against their names.
    </p>

    <p>
      The catalogues shown outside of the site directory listings are the
      default set and are those shown in the "Catalogs" sub-menus of the
      "Data-Servers" menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queries for images of a region of sky can be made by selecting the
      "Image Servers" item and queries of existing observations of a region
      of sky by the "Archives" items.
