<h3>Displaying a vector map</h3>
<p>Select a catalogue using the "Open" item in the "File" menu (or
click on one of the recently accessed file names in the "File"
menu). The catalogue must be either a FITS binary table, or any of the
other formats readable by the POLPACK package. The catalogue must
contain columns containing Cartesian X and Y coordinates for each
vector. If the names of these column are not "X" and "Y", then the
names should be specified in a text file called $HOME/.polpackrc as in
the following example (where the names of the two columns are
"PIXEL_X" and "PIXEL_Y"):
<pre>
% cat $HOME/.polpackrc
Column X PIXEL_X
Column Y PIXEL_Y
</pre>
This file can also contain the names of other columns; in particular
the names of columns containing RA and DEC values can be supplied if
these are not just "RA" and "DEC" (the defaults). RA and DEC values
are qualified by EPOCH and EQUINOX parameters supplied with the
catalogue, but these both default to J2000 if not supplied.

<p>If an image is displayed in the main image window, an attempt will
be made to align the vectors with the image. If both image and
catalogue contain RA and DEC values, then alignment will be in RA and
DEC.  Otherwise alignment will be in pixel coordinates (based on the X
and Y columns in the catalogue).

<p>If no image is displayed in the main window, a blank image will be
created covering the area of the catalogue. The colour of this image
can be controlled as usual using the colour maps and intensity scaling
controls in the main image control panel.

<p>The columns to use for the length and orientation of each vector
are specified on the "Rendering" tab, and default to "P" and
"ANG". This tab also contains controls for setting the appearance of
vectors. The appearance of selected vectors and unselected vectors can
be controlled separately. Note, entering a blank value in the "Vector
scale" box will cause a default vector scale to be calculated and
used.  If a blank value is entered in the "Thickness" box for selected
vectors, then selected vectors are rendered with the same thickness as
unselected vectors.

<h3>Binning vectors</h3>
<p>Click on the "Binning" tab, select the required binning parameters
and press the "Bin now" button. This will replace the displayed vector
map with a map formed by binning all the previously displayed vectors
(both selected and unselected). If you do not like the results, press
the "Un-do" item in the "Edit" menu to re-instate the original map!

<h3>Removing vectors</h3>
<p>Select the vectors to be removed using any of the techniques in the
"How to select vectors" section of this help, and then press the "Cut"
item in the "Edit" menu. The selected vectors will be removed from the
map. To re-instate the original map, press the "Un-do" button in the
"Edit" menu.

<h3>Saving the currently displayed vectors</h3>
<p>Click the "Save as" item in the "File" menu.

<h3>Selecting vectors</h3>
<p>Various operations within the toolbox require some vectors to be
selected in order for the operation to complete. Vectors can be
selected in several ways:
<ol>
<li>By clicking and dragging with the left mouse button over the
displayed vector map. The shape of the region dragged out by the
pointer can be either a rectangle or a circle, and is set on the
"Selecting" tab. If the control and shift keys are pressed when the
button is clicked, any selected vectors are added to the previous
selection.</li>

<li>By pointing at an individual vector and clicking with the left
button. This will select the single vector under the pointer. Again,
if the control and shift buttons are pressed, the selected vector is
added to the current selection.</li>

<li>By clicking and dragging in the table of vectors in the Polarimetry
toolbox window. Again, if the control and shift buttons are pressed,
the selected vectors are added to the current selection.</li>

<li>By entering an algebraic expression into the "Expression:" box on
the "Selecting" tab, and pressing &lt;Return&gt;. The variables within this
expression should be the names of catalogue columns, preceded by a
dollar sign ($). The expression should be a legal Tcl expression. The
expression is evaluated for each row in the catalogue, and if the
result is non-zero the row is selected. For example, "$P &gt; 50" selects
vectors which have a value larger than 50 in the P column; 
"$P &gt; 2*$DP" selects vectors with a signal to noise ratio better than 2. If
the control and shift buttons are pressed when the &lt;Return&gt; button is
pressed, the selected vectors are added to the current selection.</li>

<li>Pressing the "Select all" button in the "Selecting" tab, will
select all vectors.</li>
</ol>

<h3>De-selecting vectors</h3>
<p>The "Selecting" tab contains a menu labelled "Operation:", which is
set to "Select" by default. In this mode, the vectors chosen using the
techniques described in the previous section are <b>selected</b>, and
all other vectors are de-selected (unless control and shift are
pressed, in which case the states of other vectors are left
unchanged). If the "Operation:" value is set to "De-select", then this
is reversed, i.e.  the chosen vectors are <b>de-selected</b>, and all
other vectors are <b>selected</b> (unless control and shift are
pressed, in which case the states of other vectors are left
unchanged).

<p>If "Operation" is set to "Select", then clicking over a blank part
of the vector map will de-select all vectors (if "Operation" is set to
"De-select", then clicking over a blank part of the vector map will
select all vectors).

<p>To remove some vectors from the current selection (i.e. to
de-select them), set "Operation" to "De-select" and then use one of
the techniques described in the previous section to choose the vectors
to be de-selected. Be careful to press control and shift while
choosing them, otherwise the sates of all other vectors will be reset
to "selected".

<h3>Performing aperture polarimetry</h3>
<p>The "Integrate" tab displays a single row of values formed by
binning all the currently selected vectors into a single vector. This
is done by combining the Stokes parameters using the selected method,
and recalculating the other columns on the basis of the combined
Stokes parameters. The table is updated automatically when new vectors
are selected. So to perform simple aperture polarimetry, select all
vectors within the aperture, and then read off the integrated values
from the table in the "Integrate" tab. No facilities currently exist
for removing any "background" Stokes parameters (caused by
inter-stellar polarization for instance). Sky subtraction should
normally be performed prior to forming the catalogue of Stokes
vectors.

<p><b>Note</b>, if the catalogue contains error information in the form
of columns of standard deviations for the Stokes parameters, then
there is a limit of 100 on the number of vectors which can be
integrated into a single measurement. This limit does not apply though
if the Stokes parameters are combined using a simple mean (selected
using the "Method" menu on the "Integrate" tab).

<h3>Specifying columns containing Stokes parameters</h3>
<p>In order to use the "Bin" or "Integrate" tabs, assumptions must be
made about which catalogue columns contain Stokes parameters. By
default, it is assumed that the Stokes parameters are contained in
columns names "I", "Q", "U" and "V", with standard deviations in
columns "DI", "DQ", "DU" and "DV". To select other columns to use for
these quantities, either use the "Column Names" tab, or create a file
called $HOME/.polpackrc containing column names prior to using the
polarimetry toolbox. This file defines columns as in the following
example:
<pre>
% cat $HOME/.polpackrc
Column I STOKES_I
Column DI STOKES_DI
</pre>
etc

<p>The second word in each line is the standard column name, and the
third word is the column name you wish to use. The standard column
names are I, Q, U, V, DI, DQ, DU, DV, P, DP , ANG, DANG, PI, DPI, X,
Y, RA and DEC. So the above example uses column "STOKES_I" in place of
"I", and "STOKES_DI" in place of "DI". If no entry is included for a
given column, then the standard column name is used. If a catalogue
does not contain a given parameter, then a blank column name can be
given in the .polpackrc file. Thus, the line
<pre>
Column V
</pre>
implies that the catalogue does not contain any V values.

<h3>Displaying vector statistics</h3>
<p>The "Statistics" tab displays a table of statistics for the
currently selected vectors. The table is updated automatically when
new vectors are selected. These statistics are simple statistics of
the values in each column, and do not make any assumptions about the
content of each column. For instance, if column "P" contains
polarization values, the "mean P" displayed in the table is literally
the mean of the P values.  It is <b>not</b> the P value implied by the
mean of the Stokes vectors. Use the "Integrate" tab for such
"Stokes-aware" statistics.

<h3>Control the key</h3>
<p>A key to the vector scale can be produced, and is controlled using
the controls on the "Key" tab. The position of the key can be changed
by clicking and dragging over the key.

<h3>Display a plane from a spectropolarimetry cube</h3>
<p>A catalogue containing spectropolarimetry data is assumed to have an
extra column containing some indication of the spectral channel for each
vector (this may be velocity, wavelength, frequency, integer channel
number, etc). By default, it is assumed that this column is named "Z",
but an alternative column name may be specified by including a line in a
text file called $HOME/.polpackrc as in the following example, which
indicates that the column named "VEL" should be used as the spectral 
channel column:
<pre>
% cat $HOME/.polpackrc
Column Z VEL
</pre>
Only a single spectral channel may be displayed at any one time. The
spectral channel to use is selected using the "SpecPol" tab. The channel
may be specified in two ways:
<ol>
   <li>as a Z column value - only rows which have the specified value in the
       Z column are displayed.</li>

   <li>as an Z axis value - this is only available if your catalogue has 
   suitable WCS information which can be used to transform the column
   values into some other physically meaningful system of units such as 
   Angstroms, Hertz, etc. </li>
</ol>
If available, the units required by each box will be displayed to the
right of the box. Entering a value into either box will result in the
corresponding value being displayed in the other box (if possible). If no
vectors have the specified Z value, the nearest value for which some
vectors exist will be used instead of the specified value. If the
catalogue contains no Z column, or if the Z column value is the same for
all rows, the entry boxes will be disabled so that nothing can be typed
in them.

<p>All subsequent operations act only on the displayed vectors (i.e. vectors
for other spectral channels are ignored). Thus, for instance, dragging a
box over the map will only select vectors in the specified channel, not
in any other channel. If you save or bin the displayed map, the resulting
map will contain only vectors for the specified spectral channel.
