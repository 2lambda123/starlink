<h3>Drawing your first grid</h3>
<p>Just press the "Draw" button at the bottom of the window. Sensible
defaults exist for all parameters.

<h3>Drawing a grid showing pixels rather than celestial coordinates</h3>
<p>Just select the "System" tab, now select the "System:" menu and
choose the option "pixels".

<h3>Drawing a grid showing celestial coordinates</h3>
<p>If your image doesn't show celestial coordinates then it doesn't
have a recognised calibration. See the astrometry toolboxes for how to
add or define a calibration (assuming this doesn't mean that there's a
really problem with an existing one).

<h3>Getting a hardcopy</h3>
<p>To get a hardcopy pull down the "File" menu in the main window and
select the "Print..." "Image..." option. This creates a dialog window
in which you can either save the displayed image and grid to a
postscript file or have it spooled directly to a printer. If the grid
graphics extends beyond the edges of the image then you will need to
select the "Capture Whole Canvas" option.

<h3>Using a different celestial coordinate system</h3>
<p>Just select the "System" tab and the three fields "System:",
"Epoch:" and "Equinox:" will appear. There are 7 different coordinate
systems to choose from, just pick the one that you want. If
appropriate you'll also be able to set the epoch and equinox of the
system.

<h3>Changing the separation between the grid lines</h3>
<p>Press the "Spacing" tab and the fields headed "Relative Grid
Spacing:" will appear. To decrease the separation between the grid
lines move the "X Axis:" and "Y Axis:" sliders to the right
(increasing value). Now press the "Draw" button and the spacing
between the grid lines should be smaller. If it doesn't change then
you may need to increase the spacing factor some more (there is a
rounding algorithm that tries to keep the labels nice numbers, which
sometimes gets in the way).

<h3>Changing the positions of the grid lines (and the number labels)</h3>
<p>This can be done using the "Place Numeric Labels Along:" section
under the "Position" tab. In the entry fields identified for the X and
Y axes you need to enter an HH/DD:MM:SS value that describes the line
you want the axis drawn down. So for instance if you wanted to draw
the Y axis along the RA "03:19:50" you enter this value and vice versa
for the X axis. Note that you select an X axis value to draw the Y
axis along and a Y axis value to draw the X axis along. Any values you
enter must be visible on the image (and be in the correct celestial
coordinate system).

<h3>Changing the plot title</h3>
<p>The plot title and the X and Y axis labels can be changed by the
controls revealed when you press the "Labelling" tab. Just type your
new title into the "Main Title:" area and press "Draw".

<p>If you want to include any characters not available on your
keyboard then you need to know the escape sequence for them. The
values you need can be found out using the xfd command (the numbers
you require are those display on the right), so for instance if you
needed to display a copyright sign you'd enter "\251" as part of the
string.

<p>A symbol font is also available. You can view all the characters
available in this using the command:
<pre>
   %  xfd -fn "*symbol*"
</pre>
One thing to note before getting carried away is that you can only use
a single font at a time, so the range of options is very limited.

<h3>Saving the options for another day</h3>
<p>Using the "Save options..." option in the file menu you can select
a file which will have a description of the current options written to
it. This file can then be used, at a later time, to restore the
options using the "Restore options..." option. The file produced is a
simple text file, but is not really intended for editing by hand.

<h3>Moving the text positions, increasing the lines thickness, get
    rid of the grid <i>etc. etc. </i></h3>
<p>There are loads of options (far too many to detail here) so just
work your way through the tabs and have a play. If you have a very
fast machine you might like to select the "Options" menu and switch on
auto-redraw.
