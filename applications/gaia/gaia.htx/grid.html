    <h3>Drawing your first grid</h3>
    <p>
      Just press the <tt>Draw</tt> button at the bottom of the
      window. Sensible defaults exist for all parameters.
    </p>

    <h3>Drawing a grid showing pixels rather than celestial coordinates</h3>
    <p>
      Just select the <tt>System</tt> tab, now select the <tt>System:</tt>
      menu and choose the option <tt>pixels</tt>.
    </p>

    <h3>Drawing a grid showing celestial coordinates</h3>
    <p>
      If your image doesn't show celestial coordinates then it doesn't have a
      recognised calibration. See the astrometry toolboxes for how to add or
      define a calibration (assuming this doesn't mean that there's a really
      problem with an existing one).
    </p>

    <h3>Getting a hardcopy</h3>
    <p>
      To get a hardcopy pull down the <tt>File</tt> menu in the main window
      and select the <tt>Print...</tt> <tt>Image...</tt> option. This creates
      a dialog window in which you can either save the displayed image and
      grid to a postscript file or have it spooled directly to a printer. If
      the grid graphics extends beyond the edges of the image then you will
      need to select the <tt>Capture Whole Canvas</tt> option.
    </p>

    <h3>Using a different celestial coordinate system</h3>
    <p>
      Just select the <tt>System</tt> tab and the three fields
      <tt>System:</tt>, <tt>Epoch:</tt> and <tt>Equinox:</tt> will
      appear. There are 7 different coordinate systems to choose from, just
      pick the one that you want. If appropriate you'll also be able to set
      the epoch and equinox of the system.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing the separation between the grid lines</h3>
    <p>
      Press the <tt>Spacing</tt> tab and the fields headed <tt>Relative Grid
      Spacing:</tt> will appear. To decrease the separation between the grid
      lines move the <tt>X Axis:</tt> and <tt>Y Axis:</tt> sliders to the
      right (increasing value). Now press the <tt>Draw</tt> button and the
      spacing between the grid lines should be smaller. If it doesn't change
      then you may need to increase the spacing factor some more (there is a
      rounding algorithm that tries to keep the labels nice numbers, which
      sometimes gets in the way).
    </p>

    <h3>Changing the positions of the grid lines (and the number labels)</h3>
    <p>
      This can be done using the <tt>Place Numeric Labels Along:</tt> section
      under the <tt>Position</tt> tab. In the entry fields identified for the
      X and Y axes you need to enter an <tt>HH/DD:MM:SS</tt> value that
      describes the line you want the axis drawn down. So for instance if you
      wanted to draw the Y axis along the RA <tt>03:19:50</tt> you enter this
      value and vice versa for the X axis. Note that you select an X axis
      value to draw the Y axis along and a Y axis value to draw the X axis
      along. Any values you enter must be visible on the image (and be in the
      correct celestial coordinate system).
    </p>

    <h3>Changing the plot title</h3>
    <p>
      The plot title and the X and Y axis labels can be changed by the
      controls revealed when you press the <tt>Labelling</tt> tab. Just type
      your new title into the <tt>Main Title:</tt> area and press
      <tt>Draw</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to include any characters not available on your keyboard
      then you need to know the escape sequence for them. The values you need
      can be found out using the xfd command (the numbers you require are
      those display on the right), so for instance if you needed to display a
      copyright sign you'd enter <tt>\251</tt> as part of the string.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also possible to display an extended sequence of characters
      using their unicode values. For instance alpha is \u03B1 and delta
      \u03B4. Full lists of uncode symbols are at:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts">http://www.unicode.org/charts</a>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note you can also get some mathematical and subscripted characters
      using unicode, for instance \u2070 is a superscripted zero and
      \u00B1 is a plus/minus sign.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally you can also use special "AST" escape sequences to get effects
      like sub and superscripts. For instance "Hello%s200+\u03B1" would
      draw Hello with an alpha scaled by 200%. To see the list of available
      AST escape sequences do:
    </p>
    <pre>
    showme sun211 Escape
    </pre>
    <p>
      In a console window. Note these comments also apply to the X and Y axes
      labels.
    </p>

    <h3>Saving the options for another day</h3>
    <p>
      Using the <tt>Save options...</tt> option in the file menu you can
      select a file which will have a description of the current options
      written to it. This file can then be used, at a later time, to restore
      the options using the <tt>Restore options...</tt> option. The file
      produced is a simple text file, but is not really intended for editing
      by hand.
    </p>

    <h3>Moving the text positions, increasing the lines thickness, get rid of the grid <i>etc. etc. </i></h3>
    <p>
      There are loads of options (far too many to detail here) so just work
      your way through the tabs and have a play. If you have a very fast
      machine you might like to select the <tt>Options</tt> menu and switch on
      auto-redraw.
    </p>

    <h3>Drawing grids on channel map images</h3>
    <p>
      Channel map images are created by the KAPPA application CHANMAP, or by
      the GAIA cube toolbox, which just runs CHANMAP on your behalf. These
      have many rectangular panels in which the coordinates are repeated. The
      default settings of this tool do not show this effect well, so an
      additional set of defaults are available in the <tt>Options</tt>
      menu. These do not draw grid-lines, move the axes to the exterior of each
      panel and draw a border around the whole image.
    </p>
