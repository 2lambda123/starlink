<h3>Moving an image</h3>
<p>You only move one image at a time (the "mobile" image). This is the
one displayed when the window is first created. You can move it by
using the arrow button arrangement, or by using your arrow keys.

<p>If you want to use your arrow keys then you should place your mouse
cursor within the bounds of the region where the image is
displayed. The image can be moved in larger steps by pressing the
Control or Shift key and the arrow keys together.


<h3>Changing which image is moved</h3>
<p>Press the "View next image" button (after halting the blink) until
the image you want to move is visible. Now press the "Mark image
mobile" button. Now when you start the blink this image will move when
you press the keyboard arrows.

<h3>Adding a new image to blink or removing an image</h3>
<p>The images that are blinked are "views" of all the images displayed
in the main windows. To add a new image close the blink window create
a new window and display the new image in it. Now when you create a
new blink toolbox this will also be shown.

<p>To remove an image select the "Images" menu at the top of the
window and deselect the appropriate one. Note you must have at least
one image displayed.

<h3>Changing the display range or colours of the blinked images</h3>
<p>The blinked images are just "views" of the main images (like the
zoom and pan windows) and copy any changes made to the main images
(including colour changes and zoom, but not pan).

<h3>Increasing the speed of blinking</h3>
<p>Increased blinking speeds correspond to a lower "Speed factor". To
reduce the speed factor press the down arrowhead to the right of the
number. Speed factor 1 is as fast as it goes.

<h3>Getting a consistent blink rate</h3>
<p>The best way to use the blink window is to run it on a lightly
loaded machine with an integral X display (i.e. a local machine not a
server). Running over a network or on a heavily loaded machine will
give an inconsistent refresh rate, about which you can do little
except keep the speed factor high. If things are really bad on your
system then switch blinking off and use the "View next image" button
to cycle the image stack by hand.

<h3>Cycling though the images "by hand"</h3>
<p>You can cycle through the displayed images one-by-one by using the
"View next image" button. Alternatively you can get the same effect by
pressing the &lt;Return&gt; key when the mouse cursor is in the image
display region.

<h3>Recovering parts of my images that are missing!</h3>
<p>If you change the size of the blink window some of your images
(usually in the right extreme) may no longer be shown. To correct this
press the "Refresh" button (this causes a full redraw).
