<h3>How to use this window</h3>
<p>This window is designed for fitting an astrometric calibration to
your image. To use it you need to go through several stages:
<ol>
<li>Obtain reference positions (e.g.) from a catalogue or DSS image.</li>
<li>Accurately position these over the corresponding image features.</li>
<li>Perform a fit from sky to image coordinates.</li>
<li>Test the new coordinate system.</li>
<li>Accept it if you're happy.</li>
</ol>
See below for more about these stages.

<h3>Obtaining reference positions</h3>
<p>You can get reference position information from many sources
(consulting your co-workers about how they get such information is
often a good start), but the most easily available in GAIA is from the
Guide Star Catalogue (GSC) and US Naval Catalogue (USNO) which you can
query using the "Catalogues..." item under the "Data-Servers" menu on
the main window.

<p>Reference positions can also be copied from DSS or other
pre-calibrated images.

<h3>Copying positions from a DSS or pre-calibrated image</h3>
<p>Press the "Transfer" button. This will create a new dialog window
in which you can pick an object in the DSS image and then pick the
same object in the current image. Do this until you've got a
reasonable set, accept the positions and this will update the
reference positions used in this window. Press the "Fit/Test" button
and you'll have an approximate calibration.

</ul>

<h3>Copying positions from a catalogue window</h3>
<p>After you've made a query to a catalogue for some reference
positions, you can copy these to this window using the "Grab"
button. This creates a dialog window from which you need to select the
catalogue you're interested in.

<p><b>Note:</b> to successfully overlay reference positions, your
image will need an approximate calibration. Do this using the method
outlined above for DSS images, or use the "Type in known calibration"
toolbox.
 
<h3>Modifying a reference position</h3>
<p>All the reference positions are listed in rows the reference
table. To modify one of these values you either:
<ol>
<li>Select the required line in the reference positions table
    and now press the "Edit" button. This opens a dialog window in
    which you can edit the positions (take care to press the "Enter"
    button to update the entry).</li>

<li>Double click mouse button 1 over the corresponding image graphics
    marker. This will result in the same dialog window being revealed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Adding a reference position</h3>
<p>To do this just press the "New" button and fill in the dialog
window. Remember to give a valid "id" (which can be any unique string
or number) and press "Enter" to create the new object. You can enter
more than one object at a time by editing new values and pressing
"Enter" again.

<h3>Deleting a reference position</h3>
<p>Either select the row in the reference table and press the "Delete"
button, or press &lt;Control-Mouse-Button-1&gt; over the marker. Note
you can delete many rows at a time by selecting all their entries in
the reference table.

<h2>Positioning reference points on your image</h2>
<p>Each reference position is associated with a graphics marker that
is displayed over the image (the default is a small circle). The
position of this marker identifies the point on the image that
corresponds to the correct position on the sky.

<h3>Moving a graphics marker</h3>
<p>You do this by:
<ol>
<li>Dragging the marker around over the image (to do this
    press, and holding down, mouse button 1 and then move
    the mouse, when your cursor is over the marker).</li>

<li>Selecting the required line in the reference positions
    table and then pressing the "Edit" button. This opens a
    dialog window in which you can edit the positions (take
    care to press the "Enter" button to update the entry).</li>

<li>Double clicking mouse button 1 over the marker will also
    create a dialog window in which you can edit the values.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Moving graphics markers as a whole</h3>
<p>If you want to move all the markers as if they are coupled together
(so that for instance they all move by the same amount, or
rotate/scale about the same point). Then open the "Options" menu and
select the "Move markers individually" item to switch this option
off. Now when you move one marker they will all move together. You'll
also notice a cross marker appearing on the image, this identifies the
rotation/scale centre and can be moved just like any other marker. To
rotate or scale all markers, press mouse button 2 over one and drag
the marker to its new position.

<h3>Seeing which markers correspond to which reference positions</h3>
<p>Just place your cursor over the marker you're interested in and the
appropriate row in the reference table will be highlighted. Double
clicking the marker also shows the values associated with the object.

<p>Pressing mouse button 2 over a selected row in the table attempts
to centre the image about the associated marker.

<h3>Accurately centering all the markers on stars</h3>
<p>If your reference positions are all stars (or non-confused peaked
objects), then you can accurately position the markers by
centroiding. Just press the "Centroid" button.

<h2>Trying out a fit</h2>
<p>After you've got sufficient reference positions created and you've
positioned their graphics markers to your satisfaction, you can
attempt a fit by pressing the "Test" button. The results of the fit
are displayed in a scrollable window just below the "Test" button.

<h2>Checking the fit</h2>
<p>After doing a fit you can assess it visually by checking the new
marker positions, which are updated. You can also read off positions
using the main window facilities, check the axes orientations using a
grid overlay (see "Overlay axes grid..." under "Image-Analysis") and
replot any catalogues positions from query windows.


<h2>Saving the new astrometry</h2>
<p>When you're happy with the quality of your calibration press the
"Accept" button to close the window. This updates the image with the
new astrometric system, but to retain this information you need to
save the image to disk (see the "Save as..." item in the "File" menu).

<h2>Miscellaneous features</h2>

<h3>Changing the appearance of the object markers</h3>
<p>Open the "Graphics" menu. Under this are many options for setting
the size, shape and colour of the markers.

<h3>Clearing the markers from the image</h3>
<p>You can do this by closing the window, or by using the "Clear" item
under the "Graphics" menu.

<h3>Redrawing the markers</h3>
<p>Open the "Graphics" menu and select the "Redraw" item.

<h3>Removing markers which are not on the image</h3>
<p>Press the "Clip" button.

<h3>Saving the reference positions</h3>
<p>You can write a plain text file copy of the reference positions
using the "Write positions to a file..." item in the "File"
menu. These can be read back later using the "Read positions from a
file...".

<h3>Reading reference positions from places other than catalogue windows</h3>
<p>You can read in reference positions from plain text files using the
"Read positions from a file..." item in the "File" menu. The format of
these files should be either:
<ol>
<li>id ra dec x y</li>
<li>id ra dec</li>
<li>ra dec</li>
</ol>
Each field should be space separated, and ra's and dec's should be
written as either hh/dd:mm:ss.ss strings or dd.dd values. Note that
this format is different to that used by "Local Catalogues", which use
a tab-separated design that also allows parameters, column naming
etc. It is designed to be simple to create using text editors and
other programs. You can manipulate and save local catalogues, but you
will need to "Grab" the values on each occasion.

<h2>What are</h2>

<h3>All those fields in the "Table parameters:" section?</h3>
<p>The fields in this section define the type and system of your
reference coordinates. Usually these will be "Equatorial" (i.e.  right
ascension and declination), in the FK5 system and have an equinox of
J2000. However, they could potentially also be in the FK4 system, in
which case the usual equinox is B1950 with epoch also of 1950. You'll
need to check the source of your reference positions to find out this
information. Most standard catalogue positions (and certainly those
which are used on-line by GAIA) are in FK5/J2000 coordinates.

<h3>All those fields in the "Astrometric parameters:"</h3>
<p>If you are dealing with images which have been taken on optical
telescopes (not Schmidt) then you can probably leave the "Projection
type:" field in its default value (radio astronomers and others with
unusual configurations will need to worry more about this field).

<p>The "X coordinate type" field is used to say which image axes are
most like the corresponding "ra" and "dec" columns (you would select
"X coordinate type:" as Dec if your image had Declination running
along the X axis). If this occasionally necessary when fitting rotated
images and using fit options other than the one that allows shearing
terms.

<p>To learn more about projections and the different types of
celestial coordinate systems have a look at the various FITS documents
available, such as "Representations of celestial coordinate in FITS",
by Eric W. Greisen and Mark Calabretta
(http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.html).
