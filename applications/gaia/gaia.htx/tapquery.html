    <h1>Query TAP service</h1>

    <p>
      Using this window you can send a query to a TAP server to generate a
      results table, hopefully with some identifiable coordinate columns that
      can be used to plot over the displayed image.
    </p>
    <p>
      TAP queries are written using Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL).
      The scope of ADQL is outside of this document and you should consult
      various on-line resources about it, such as <a
      href="http://docs.g-vo.org/adql">http://docs.g-vo.org/adql</a> and the
      various documents about ADQL at the IVOA:
      <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/astronomers/index.html">
        http://www.ivoa.net/astronomers/index.html</a>.  There may also be
        information about the available tables kept with the primary source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important issues when writing a query are which tables are available,
      these are enumerated in the <tt>Tables...</tt> dialog, along with their
      columns and column descriptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Simple example</h2>
    <p>
      As a simple example, we can attempt to find out which SCUBA-2 images are
      available for a region of sky from the TAP service at CADC. To try this
      enter <tt>CADC</tt> in the <tt>Substring:</tt> field and press
      <tt>Query</tt>. At the time of writing this returned one entry <tt>CADC
      Table Query (TAP) Service</tt>, double click on this to open a new
      window. In the <tt>ADQL Query</tt> text area enter:
<pre>
SELECT * from caom2.SIAv1 WHERE 
</pre>
      now press <tt>Insert area fragment...</tt> (assumes you have a suitable
      image displayed, this example assumes that you have the NGC1275 area
      displayed, an image of that can be found in the
      <tt>$GAIA_DIR/demodata.tar.gz</tt> file). That will give you:
<pre>
SELECT * from caom2.SIAv1 WHERE
 &lt;RA&gt; BETWEEN 49.8427477105 AND 50.0577638558 
 AND 
 &lt;DEC&gt; BETWEEN 41.4259083699 AND 41.5971742773
</pre>
      Now you need to replace the <tt>&lt;RA&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;DEC&gt;</tt>
      strings with the names of the RA and Dec columns from the
      <tt>caom2.SIAv1</tt> table.  Those can be guessed using the
      <tt>Tables...</tt> window where you should select <tt>caom2.SIAv1</tt>
      to see the names of its columns. In this case the RA and Dec columns are
      <tt>position_center_ra</tt> and <tt>position_center_dec</tt>, so we now
      have:
<pre>
SELECT * from caom2.SIAv1 WHERE 
position_center_ra BETWEEN 49.8427477105 AND 50.0577638558 
 AND 
position_center_dec BETWEEN 41.4259083699 AND 41.5971742773
</pre>
      Pressing <tt>Query</tt> will now get a list of observations. The
      pointing centres of the observations will be overlaid on your image.  If
      the observations have images associated with them you can double click
      and display them, either in the same display or a new one.
  </p>
    <p>
      Now we can refine the query further by asking for exposures only from
      SCUBA-2 and with a good exposure time to give:
<pre>
SELECT * from caom2.SIAv1 WHERE 
position_center_ra BETWEEN 49.8427477105 AND 50.0577638558 
AND 
position_center_dec BETWEEN 41.4259083699 AND 41.5971742773
AND
instrument_name = 'SCUBA-2'
AND
time_exposure > 30
</pre>
      And so one until the observations we want to really look at have been
      discovered, improving on the scatter shot approach of the general show
      me all the images approach. Note there are better ways to 
      describe a region on the sky, see the ADQL documents, but this
      works for simple queries that don't include <tt>RA=0</tt> and
      <tt>Dec=+/-90</tt>.
  </p>
    
    <h2>STC regions</h2>
    <p>
      You can change the plotting symbols using the <tt>Markers</tt>
      menu or <tt>Options->Set plot symbols...</tt> window, in which you'll
      find the <tt>STC</tt> option. If your response has an STC region column
      that can be identified you can use this to plot more complex shapes,
      like the actual footprint of the observation. In the <tt>Tables...</tt>
      descriptions if a column has a <tt>xtype</tt> of <tt>adql:REGION</tt>
      this may work.
