    <p>
      This dialog helps you import a catalogue created by the CUPID
      (SUN/255) package.
    </p>
    <p>
      To import a catalogue just select it's name and press <tt>Import</tt>.
      By default this will open the catalogue and display the STC-S shapes
      that it describes over the image. The supported STC-S shapes are
      ellipses and polygons.
    </p>
    <p>
      To not use the STC-S shapes unselect <tt>STC Shape</tt> and choose which
      columns to use as RA and Dec. This will generally display rectangles
      based on the extents of the related columns.
