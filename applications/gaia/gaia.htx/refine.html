<p>This window is designed to allow you to tweak your astrometric
coordinate system by adding in a linear transformation that corrects
the positions on your image. To use it you need to go through several
stages:
<ol>
<li>Obtain reference positions (e.g.) from a catalogue.</li>
<li>Position them over the corresponding image features.</li>
<li>Perform a fit or assign a transformation.</li>
<li>Test the coordinate system.</li>
<li>Accept it if you're happy.</li>
</ol>
See below for more about these stages.

<h3>Obtaining reference positions</h3>
<p>You can get reference position information from many sources
(consulting your coworkers about how they get such information is
often a good start), but the most easily available in GAIA is from the
Guide Star Catalogue (GSC) and US Naval Catalogue (USNO) which you can
query using the "Catalogues..." item under the "Data-Servers" menu on
the main window.

<h3>Copying positions from a catalogue window</h3>
<p>After you've made a query to a catalogue for some reference
positions, you can copy these to this window using the "Grab"
button. This creates a dialog window from which you need to select the
catalogue you're interested in.

<h3>Modifying a reference position</h3>
<p>All the reference positions are listed in the reference table. To
modify one of these values you either:
<ol>
<li>Select the required line in the reference positions table
    and now press the "Edit" button. This opens a dialog window in
    which you can edit the positions (take care to press the "Enter"
    button to update the entry).</li>

<li>Double click mouse button 1 over the corresponding image graphics
    marker. This will result in the same dialog window being revealed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Adding a reference position</h3>
<p>To do this just press the "New" button and fill in the dialog
window. Remember to give a valid "id" (which can be any unique string
or number) and press "Enter" to create the new object. You can enter
more than one object at a time by editing new values and pressing
"Enter" again.

<h3>Deleting a reference position</h3>
<p>Either select the row in the reference table and press the "Delete"
button, or press &lt;Control-Mouse-Button-1&gt; over the marker. Note you
can delete many rows at a time by selecting all their entries in the
reference table.

<h2>Positioning reference points on your image</h2>
<p>Each reference position is associated with a graphics marker that is
displayed over the image (the default is a small circle). The position
of this marker identifies the point on the image that corresponds to
the correct position on the sky.

<h3>Moving a graphics marker</h3>
You do this by:
<ol>
<li>Dragging the marker around over the image (you do this by
    pressing, and holding down, mouse button 1 and then moving
    the mouse, when your cursor is over the marker).</li>

<li>By selecting the required line in the reference positions
    table and then pressing the "Edit" button. This opens a
    dialog window in which you can edit the positions (take
    care to press the "Enter" button to update the entry).</li>

<li>Double clicking mouse button 1 over the marker will also
    create a dialog window in which you can edit the values.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Moving graphics markers as a whole</h3>
<p>If you want to move all the markers as if they where coupled
together (so that for instance they all move by the same amount, or
rotate/scale about the same point). Then you can achieve this in two
ways:
<ol>
<li>Use the sliders and/or entry fields in the "Simple
    transformations" section. To enter a value by hand
    just type the new value into the appropriate entry field and
    then press &lt;Return&gt;. The markers will now be updated (note
    that you are not restricted to the range of values allowed by
    the sliders).</li>

<li>Deselect the "Move markers individually:" option. Now when
    you move one marker they will all move together. You'll also
    notice a cross marker appearing on the image, this identifies
    the rotation/scale centre and can be moved just like any
    other marker. To rotate or scale all markers, press mouse
    button 2 over one and drag the marker to its new position.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Seeing which markers correspond to which reference positions</h3>
<p>Just place your cursor over the marker you're interested in and the
appropriate row in the reference table will be highlighted. Double
clicking the marker also shows the values associated with the object.

<p>Pressing mouse button 2 over a selected row in the table attempts
to centre the image about the associated marker.

<h3>Accurately centering all the markers on stars</h3>
<p>If your reference positions are all stars (or non-confused peaked
objects), then you can accurately position the markers by
centroiding. Just press the "Centroid" button.

<h2>Trying out a fit</h2>
<p>After you've got sufficient reference positions created and you've
positioned their graphics markers to your satisfaction, you can
attempt a tweak by pressing the "Fit/Test" button. The results of
the fit are displayed in a scrollable window just below the "Test"
button.

<p>The fitting process uses a linear transformation between the
projected X and Y positions (i.e. those your current calibration
provide) and the new positions that you've determined. You can control
the level of refinement by selecting the "Options" menu and choosing a
different type of linear fit used to make the refinement (this is
useful when you know certain properties of the coordinate system). The
results that you see are those of this fit, not of the sky coordinate
system to the image.

<p><b>Note:</b> that if you've applied a simple transformation to the
markers (using the sliders and entry fields) then you should press the
"Assign" button rather than the "Fit/Test" button (actually this makes
little difference when you have many reference positions, as it is
almost identical to using "Fit/Test" with a solid body fit, but if you
want to apply a simple transformation to the coordinates without
reference positions, then it is essential).

<h2>Checking the fit</h2>
<p>After doing a tweak you can assess it visually by checking the new
marker positions, which are updated. You can also read off positions
using the main window facilities, check the axes orientations using a
grid overlay (see "Overlay axes grid..." under "Image-Analysis") and
replot any catalogues positions from query windows.

<h2>Saving the new astrometry</h2>
<p>When you're happy with the quality of your new calibration press
the "Accept" button to close the window. This updates the image with
the new astrometric system, but to retain this information you need to
save the image to disk (see the "Save as..." item in the "File" menu).

<h2>Miscellaneous features</h2>

<h3>Changing the appearance of the object markers</h3>
<p>Open the "Graphics" menu. Under this are many options for setting
the size, shape and colour of the markers.

<h3>Clearing the markers from the image</h3>
<p>You can do this by closing the window, or by using the "Clear" item
under the "Graphics" menu.

<h3>Redrawing the markers</h3>
<p>Open the "Graphics" menu and select the "Redraw" item.

<h3>Removing markers which are not on the image</h3>
<p>Press the "Clip" button.

<h3>Saving the reference positions</h3>
<p>You can write a plain text file copy of the reference positions using
the "Write positions to a file..." item in the "File" menu. These can
be read back later using the "Read positions from a file...".

<h3>Reading reference positions from places other than catalogue windows</h3>
<p>You can read in reference positions from plain text files using the
"Read positions from a file..." item in the "File" menu. The format of
these files should be either:
<ol>
 <li>id ra dec x y</li>
 <li>id ra dec</li>
 <li>ra dec</li>
</ol>
Each field should be space separated, and ra's and dec's should be
written as either hh/dd:mm:ss.ss strings or dd.dd values. Note
that this format is different to that used by "Local Catalogues",
which use a tab-separated design that also allows parameters, column
naming etc. It is designed to be simple to create using text editors
and other programs. You can manipulate and save local catalogues, but
you will need to "Grab" the values on each occasion.
