    <p>
      Using this tool you can query the current list of Simple Image Access
      servers for lists of any images that they have for the given region of
      sky. 
    </p>
    <h3>Defining the search region</h3>
    <p>
      You can define the sky region using either an object name lookup,
      entering the RA and Dec (FK5/J2000) coordinates, making it the same
      region as the displayed image (<tt>Set area from image</tt>) or by
      dragging out a region of the displayed image 
      (<tt>Select area...</tt>). You can define a height and width for the
      region, in arcminutes, but not all servers will make use of that
      information, using just the width. Some servers will also just return a
      plate containing the region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have defined the region to check for images press the 
      <tt>Query</tt> button. That will initiate a series of queries to all the
      known servers. Successful responses will add a new menu item to the
      <tt>SIAP server results:</tt> drop-down menu. Select an item to see the
      page of images available.
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying an image</h3>
    <p
      To download and display an image either double click on the selected
      row, or just select a row and press either <tt>Display</tt> or 
      <tt>Display in new</tt>. 
    </p>

    <h3>Changing the servers to query</h3>
    <p>
      Querying all the servers can take quite a long time and you may have a
      better idea of those which are relevant to your science goal. To change
      the list press the <tt>View image servers...</tt>. Using that you can 
      remove servers from the query list and query a VO registry about
      additional services not already available, as well as being able to
      apply a constraint like selecting only servers that have a string in
      their titles.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Blacklisting</h3>
    <p>
      Because the VO is an evolving service many servers have been put up for
      testing only and never return a good set of images. These servers are
      best just forgotten about and so can be blacklisted. GAIA defines a
      default set of such servers
      (see <tt>$HOME/.skycat/GaiaSIAPBlacklist</tt>) and any servers that fail
      in a response will be offered up addition to the blacklist.
