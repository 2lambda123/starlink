        Displaying additional iso-surfaces from other cubes
      </font></h2>
    <p>
      Using this toolbox you can open up additional cubes and draw
      iso-surfaces from them in the rendered scene (this works for both the
      iso-surface and volume rendering toolboxes). This allows you to compare
      data from different energies and sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choosing the data and selecting levels should be straight-forward (note
      that the <tt>Go</tt> menus provide a simple way to select a cube you've
      previously opened). A cube can be temporarily removed by de-selecting
      the <tt>Display:</tt> checkbox. <b>Note</b> that to display the
      iso-surfaces, or see any changes, you must press the <tt>Draw</tt>
      button in the rendering window.
    </p>

    <h3>Alignment</h3>
    <p>
      By default GAIA will use any coordinate system information to align the
      iso-surfaces of the extra cubes to that of the displayed cube. So you
      should see a scene in which the cubes are aligned correctly on the sky
      and along the spectral axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes you'll want to align cube using their simple grid
      positions. To do this you need to de-select the <tt>Match
      coordinates</tt> item in the <tt>Options</tt> menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other coordinate matching options are
      <tt>Match sidebands</tt> and <tt>Match using base system</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you select <tt>Match sidebands</tt> and you have heterodyne cubes
      with suitably defined dual-sideband spectral coordinates then this will
      be taken into account when matching (otherwise matching will just use
      the frequencies or velocites of the current sideband).
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>Match using base system:</tt> when matching spectral coordinates it
      is usual to achieve this by transforming all coordinate systems into a
      common system, this system is wavelength by default. For some systems it
      may be better to use another common system so by selecting this option
      (which is on by default) you can set the common system used to be that
      of the current spectral axes of the main cube. This option is most
      useful when working with velocities, when you want the alignment to
      happen in that system (because the spectra have different rest
      frequencies).
