<p>Automatic source detection is performed using the "Object
detection..." toolbox activated from the "Image-Analysis" menu.  This
provides the ability to automatically detect and parameterise all the
objects on an image. These objects are then identified by displaying
ellipses over the image and are available for interactive
inspection. The resultant measurements are displayed in a catalogue
window which can be used to inspect the individual values, select data
on the bases of range limits and change the appearance of the
ellipses.

<p>The toolbox uses the EXTRACTOR and SExtractor programs to do the
actual detections. EXTRACTOR is just a Starlink modified version of
Emmanuel Bertin's SExtractor. EXTRACTOR and SExtractor are briefly
described in Starlink User Note 226 (SUN/226). Consult this for
additional pointers to help. The internals of SExtractor are described
in other documents that are reference in SUN/226 (like the SExtractor
user manuals).
