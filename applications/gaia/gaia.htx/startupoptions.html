<h2 align=center><font color=red>Configuring startup options</font></h2>

    <p>This window allows you to set the various options that GAIA supports
    when starting up. These will be saved when applied and then used the next
    time that GAIA starts. All these options can also be specified on the
    command-line, or by using X properties.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Use a floating panel (-float_panel)</b><br> Create the control
      panel area in a detached window.</li>
      
      <li><b>Panel orientation (-panel_orient)</b><br > Set the orientation
      for the properties panel. If vertical if will appear on the left (makes
      the display area more square on wide display, moves the panel from under
      the spectral plot).
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Display a zoom window (-with_zoom_window)</b><br> Display, or
      not, the zoom window in the control panel.</li>
      
      <li><b>Display a panner window (-with_pan_window)</b><br> Display, or
      not, the panner window in the control panel.</li>

      <li><b>Display a color ramp (-with_colorramp)</b><br> Display, or not,
      the color ramp shown at the bottom of the main window.</li>

      <li><b>Focus follows mouse (-focus_follows_mouse)</b><br> Image and
      entry focus follows mouse pointer, alternative is to click on these
      first.</li>
      
      <li><b>Show image scrollbars (-scrollbars)</b><br> Display, or not, the
      scrollbars around the main image.</li>

      <li><b>Make toolboxes transient (-transient_tools)</b><br> Ask the
      window manager to make any toolboxes transient, or not. Transient
      windows may remain permanently above their parent window (depends on
      window manager properties).</li>

      <li><b>Make spectral plot transient (-transient_spectralplot)</b><br>
      Ask the window manager to make the spectral plot windows transient, or
      not. Transient windows may remain permanently above their parent window
      (depends on window manager properties).</li>

      <li><b>Exit without prompt (-quiet_exit)</b><br> When closing GAIA using
      the <tt>Exit</tt> item ask for confirmation before exiting, or not. Note
      that it is still possible to close GAIA without a request, if this is
      the last window and you use <tt>Close</tt>, or the window manager closes
      the last window.</li>

      <li><b>Display milli-arcsecs (-extended_precision)</b><br> The default
      precision for RA is three decimal places in seconds of time, for DEC two
      decimal places. If this option is selected an extra decimal place is
      added to give roughly milli-arcsecond resolution.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Linear CAR projections (-linear_cartesian)</b></br> Assume CAR
      projections are a linear mapping. Assumes that all Cartesian projections
      are simple linear mappings, ignoring the possibility of spherical
      rotations. Refer to the CarLin attribute of the AST (SUN/211) library
      for more about this option.
      </li>

      <li><b>Show HDU chooser (-show_hdu_chooser)</b><br> By default when you
      open a FITS or HDS file that contains more than one image the HDU
      chooser appears so that you can select between the images. This window
      can also be opened for any image using the "Select FITS HDU/NDF..." item
      in the "View" menu. On some occasions (mainly when running GAIA using
      remote control) this behaviour is unwanted and the chooser should remain
      inactive.
      </li>

      <li><b>Always merge MEF headers (-always_merge)</b><br> When looking for
      a WCS in a FITS extension some of the details may be only present in the
      primary data units headers (dates and systems usually). When this is
      true you will want to merge the primary and extension headers. An option
      as this can cause unanticipated problems.
      </li>

      <li><b>Check for cubes (-check_for_cubes)</b><br> When a data file is
      opened, from the the command-line, open dialog or Go history menu, check
      if it contains a cube and if so open it using the cube toolbox. It's
      more efficient to open such a file directly from the cube toolbox, so
      this is an option.
      </li>

      <li><b>Show Interop menu (-interop_menu)</b><br> Display the
      <tt>Interop</tt> menu (default), so that PLASTIC can be used for
      interoperating with other VO-enabled applications.
      </li>

      <li><b>Auto scale (-autoscale)</b><br> Scale the image and graphics so
      that they always fit within the main window (disables the zoom controls,
      but responds to resizing of the main window). See <tt>View->Auto
      scale</tt>.
      </li>

      <li><b>Auto fit (-autofit)</b><br> Scale the image so that it fits
      within the main window when first opened.  See <tt>View->Auto fit</tt>.
      </li>

      <li><b>Minimum zoom (-min_zoom)</b><br> The lowest scale factor to be
      offered in the <tt>Scale:</tt> menu. Negative values are lower factors.
      </li>

      <li><b>Maximum zoom (_max_zoom)</b><br> The highest scale factor to be
      offered in the <tt>Scale:</tt> menu. Note that the <tt>Scale:</tt> menu
      may run off the edges of the display if the difference between the
      minimum zoom and this value is too large.
      </li>

      <li><b>Zoom factor (-zoom_factor)</b><br> The scale factor used in the
      zoom window.
      </li>

      <li><b>Pick zoom factor (-pick_zoom_factor)</b><br> The scale factor 
        used in the zoom window of the <tt>View->Pick Object...</tt> 
        toolbox.
      </li>

      <li><b>Default cut (-default_cut)</b><br> The default percentile cut
      used when opening an image. Note that this only apply to images (files)
      that have not already been opened. Images that have already been opened
      use the value stored in the history.  To clear the history remove the
      file <tt>$HOME/.skycat/history or</tt> use the <tt>"Data
      Servers"->"History..."</tt> window.
      </li>

      <li><b>Centroid search box (-isize)</b><br> Search box size used when
      centroiding.
      </li>

      <li><b>Centroid max shift (-maxshift)</b><br> Maximum shift from initial
      position when centroiding.
      </li>

      <li><b>Default colormap (-default_cmap)</b><br> The colormap to be used
      by default. Note that this isn't as useful as it might seem as images
      previously viewed will be shown with the colormap they where last
      displayed with, and the default colormap becomes the one last selected.
      </li>

      <!-- li><b>Default itt (-default_itt)</b><br> The default intensity
      transfer table (the notes about colormaps also apply to this option).
      </li>-->

      <li><b>Blank colour (-blank_color)</b><br> The colour used to display
      blank pixels.
      </li>

      <li><b>Background colour (-image_background)</b><br> The colour used to
      in the background of the main image.
      </li>

      <li><b>Label font (-labelfont)</b><br> The font used in the many labels
      in the GAIA interface. You may need to change this if your
      <tt>variable</tt> font doesn't match the expected size (usually 12
      pixel). Any font reported by the <tt>xlsfonts</tt> or selected by the
      <tt>xfontsel</tt> commands can be used, as can Tcl generic fonts
      (see the section <tt>n</tt> font man page, a good default may be
      </tt>"Helvetica -12 bold"</tt>).
      </li>

      <li><b>Text font (-textfont)</b><br> The font used in the many text
      reports in the GAIA interface. You may need to change this if your
      <tt>fixed</tt> font doesn't match the expected size (usually 12
      pixel). Any font reported by the <tt>xlsfonts</tt> or selected by the
      <tt>xfontsel</tt> commands can be used, as can Tcl generic fonts (see
      the section <tt>n</tt> font man page, a good default may be 
      </tt>"Fixed -12"</tt>).
      </li>

      <li><b>WCS font (-labelfont)</b><br> The font used in the labels showing
      alpha and delta as symbols in the GAIA interface. You may need to change
      this if the default font doesn't match the expected size (usually 14
      pixel). Any font reported by the <tt>xlsfonts</tt> or selected by the
      <tt>xfontsel</tt> commands can be used, as can Tcl generic fonts, but
      the alpha and delta labels should be the <tt>a</tt> and <tt>d</tt>
      characters (see the section <tt>n</tt> font man page, a good default may
      be </tt>"Symbol -14"</tt>).
      </li>

      <li><b>Font scale (-font_scale)</b><br> A scaling factor for non-pixel
      sized fonts. Note this also changes the apparent size of pixel sized
      fonts, so the amount of space reserved around labels can be changed
      (often reducing this will help when working on displays with restricted
      sizes). Set to 0 to work with the display default (the actual value is
      usually around the display resolution in DPI divided by 72).
      </li>
</ul>
