<h2 align=center><font color=red>Configuring startup options</font></h2>

<p>This window allows you to set the various options that GAIA supports
when starting up. These will be saved when applied and then used the
next time that GAIA starts. All these options can also be specified on
the command-line, or by using X properties.

<ul>
      <li><b>Use a floating panel (-float_panel)</b><br>
        Create the control panel area in a detached window.</li>

      <li><b>Panel orientation (-panel_orient)</b><br >
        Set the orientation for the properties panel. If vertical
        if will appear on the left (makes the display area more square on wide
        display, moves the panel from under the spectral plot).
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Display a zoom window (-with_zoom_window)</b><br>
        Display, or not, the zoom window in the control panel.</li>
      
      <li><b>Display a panner window (-with_pan_window)</b><br>
        Display, or not, the panner window in the control panel.</li>

      <li><b>Display a color ramp (-with_colorramp)</b><br>
        Display, or not, the color ramp shown at the bottom of the
        main window.</li> 

      <li><b>Focus follows mouse (-focus_follows_mouse)</b><br>
        Image and entry focus follows mouse pointer, alternative is to click
        on these first.</li>
      
      <li><b>Show image scrollbars (-scrollbars)</b><br>
        Display, or not, the scrollbars around the main image.</li>

      <li><b>Make toolboxes transient (-transient_tools)</b><br>
        Ask the window manager to make any toolboxes transient, or
        not. Transient windows may remain permanently above their parent
        window (depends on window manager properties).</li>

      <li><b>Exit without prompt (-quiet_exit)</b><br>
        When closing GAIA using the <tt>Exit</tt> item ask for confirmation
        before exiting, or not. Note that it is still possible to close GAIA
        without a request, if this is the last window and you use
        <tt>Close</tt>, or the window manager closes the last window.</li>

      <li><b>Display milli-arcsecs (-extended_precision)</b><br>
        The default precision for RA is three decimal places in
        seconds of time, for DEC two decimal places. If this option is
        selected an extra decimal place is added to give roughly
        milli-arcsecond resolution.
        </li>

      <li><b>Show HDU chooser (-show_hdu_chooser)</b><br>
        By default when you open a FITS or HDS file that contains more
        than one image the HDU chooser appears so that you can select between
        the images. This window can also be opened for any image using
        the "Select FITS HDU/NDF..." item in the "View" menu. On some
        occasions (mainly when running GAIA using remote control) this
        behaviour is unwanted and the chooser should remain inactive.
      </li>

      <li><b>Always merge MEF headers (-always_merge)</b><br>
        When looking for a WCS in a FITS extension some of the details may be
        only present in the primary data units headers (dates and systems
        usually). When this is true you will want to merge the primary and
        extension headers. An option as this can cause unanticipated problems.
      </li>

      <li><b>Check for cubes (-check_for_cubes)</b><br>
        When a data file is opened, from the the command-line, open dialog or
        Go history menu, check if it contains a cube and if so open it using
        the cube toolbox. It's more efficient to open such a file directly
        from the cube toolbox, so this is an option.
      </li>

      <li><b>Minimum zoom (-min_zoom)</b><br>
        The lowest zoom factor to be offered in the <tt>Scale:</tt>
        menu. Negative values are lower factors.
        </li>

      <li><b>Maximum zoom (_max_zoom)</b><br>
        The highest zoom factor to be offered in the <tt>Scale:</tt>
        menu. Note that the <tt>Scale:</tt> menu may run off the edges
        of the display if the difference between the minimum zoom and
        this value is too large.
        </li>

      <li><b>Zoom factor (-zoom_factor)</b><br>
        The zoom factor used in the zoom window. 
        </li>

      <li><b>Default cut (-default_cut)</b><br>
        The default percentile cut used when opening an image. Note that this
        only apply to images (files) that have not already been opened. Images
        that have already been opened use the value stored in the history.
        To clear the history remove the file <tt>$HOME/.skycat/history or</tt>
        use the <tt>"Data Servers"->"History..."</tt> window.
      </li>

      <li><b>Default colormap (-default_cmap)</b><br>
        The colormap to be used by default. Note that this isn't as
        useful as it might seem as images previously viewed will be
        shown with the colormap they where last displayed with, and
        the default colormap becomes the one last selected.
      </li>

      <li><b>Default itt (-default_itt)</b><br>
        The default intensity transfer table (the notes about
        colormaps also apply to this option).
      </li>
</ul>
