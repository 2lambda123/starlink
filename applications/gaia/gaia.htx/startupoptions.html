<h2 align=center><font color=red>Configuring startup options</font></h2>

<p>This window allows you to set the various options that GAIA supports
when starting up. These will be saved when applied and then used the
next time that GAIA starts. All these options can also be specified on
the command-line, or by using X properties.

<ul>
      <li><b>Use a floating panel (-float_panel)</b><br>
        Create the control panel area in a detached window.</li>
      
      <li><b>Display a zoom window (-with_zoom_window)</b><br>
        Display, or not, the zoom window in the control panel.</li>
      
      <li><b>Display a panner window (-with_pan_window)</b><br>
        Display, or not, the panner window in the control panel.</li>

      <li><b>Display a color ramp (-with_colorramp)</b><br>
        Display, or not, the color ramp shown at the bottom of the
        main window.</li> 

      <li><b>Focus follows mouse (-focus_follows_mouse)</b><br>
        Image and entry focus follows mouse pointer, alternative is to click
        on these first.</li>
      
      <li><b>Show image scrollbars (-scrollbars)</b><br>
        Display, or not, the scrollbars around the main image.</li>

      <li><b>Make toolboxes transient (-transient_tools)</b><br>
        Ask the window manager to make any toolboxes transient, or
        not. Transient windows may remain permanently above their parent
        window (depends on window manager properties).</li>

      <li><b>Exit without prompt (-quiet_exit)</b><br>
        When closing GAIA using the <tt>Exit</tt> item ask for confirmation
        before exiting, or not. Note that it is still possible to close GAIA
        without a request, if this is the last window and you use
        <tt>Close</tt>, or the window manager closes the last window.</li>

      <li><b>Display milli-arcsecs (-extended_precision)</b><br>
        The default precision for RA is three decimal places in
        seconds of time, for DEC two decimal places. If this option is
        selected an extra decimal place is added to give roughly
        milli-arcsecond resolution.
        </li>

      <li><b>Minimum zoom (-min_zoom)</b><br>
        The lowest zoom factor to be offered in the <tt>Scale:</tt>
        menu. Negative values are lower factors.
        </li>

      <li><b>Maximum zoom (_max_zoom)</b><br>
        The highest zoom factor to be offered in the <tt>Scale:</tt>
        menu. Note that the <tt>Scale:</tt> menu may run off the edges
        of the display if the difference between the minimum zoom and
        this value is too large.
        </li>

      <li><b>Default colormap (-default_cmap)</b><br>
        The colormap to be used by default. Note that this isn't as
        useful as it might seem as images previously viewed will be
        shown with the colormap they where last displayed with, and
        the default colormap becomes the one last selected.
      </li>

      <li><b>Default itt (-default_itt)</b><br>
        The default intensity transfer table (the notes about
        colormaps also apply to this option).
      </li>
</ul>
