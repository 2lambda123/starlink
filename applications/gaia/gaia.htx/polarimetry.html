<p>The polarization vector plotting and manipulation toolbox provides the
ability to display vector maps produced by the POLPACK package (see
Starlink User Note 223). It also allows you to select sub-sets of
vectors, either by algebraic expressions or by rectangular
regions. Selected parts can be removed or saved to new catalogues. New
vector maps can be created by binning vectors and reports of the
properties of selections can be displayed.
