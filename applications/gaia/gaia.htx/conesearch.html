    <p>
      Using this window you query the named Cone service for any information
      it has about a region on the sky. If successful a VOTable catalogue will
      be returned that can have markers displayed on the current image.
    </p>

    <h3>Defining the search region</h3>
    <p>
      You can define the sky region using either an object name lookup,
      entering the RA and Dec (FK5/J2000) coordinates, making it the same
      region as the displayed image (<tt>Set area from image</tt>) or by
      dragging out a region of the displayed image 
      (<tt>Select area...</tt>). The <tt>Size</tt> is in arcminutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have defined the region to check press the <tt>Query</tt>
      button. That will initiate a query and if the service has any
      information rows will appear in the table. 
    <p>

    <h3>Drawing markers</h3>
    <p>
      By default circles will be drawn on the image, you can change this using
      the <tt>Markers</tt> menu, or use more sophisticated marker that scale
      with magnitude for instance, using the 
      <tt>Options->Set plot symbols...</tt> toolbox.
