<h3>Patching a round (i.e. stellar) feature</h3>
<ul>
<li>Press the circle shape just below "Add replacement region:".</li>
<li>Place your cursor on the image over the star.</li>
<li>Press down and hold down button one.</li>
<li>Move the mouse sideways until the circle contains all the feature.</li>
<li>Release the button.</li>
<li>Press the "Patch" button.</li>
</ul>
If your annulus (the bit between the circle you created and the outer
circle which appeared afterwards) didn't contain any other objects
then the feature will have been "patched" and you shouldn't be able to
see where it was.

<h3>Saving the results</h3>
<p><b>WARNING --- the patched image just exists in memory</b> to keep
the changes you must use the "Save as..." option in the main windows
"File" menu. If you want to use other toolboxes on this modified image
you must then redisplay it.

<h3>How it all works</h3>
<p>The patch is created from a surface fit to the data contained in
the annulus or sky apertures (the "background" region). This fit is
then used to interpolate under the object aperture(s) (the
"replacement" region). The deviations of the fit from the data in the
background region are then used to estimate a noise factor. Values
typical of this noise factor are then used to modify the surface fit
resulting in a patch that looks just like the data in the background
region, but that smoothly varies with the same gradient.

<h3>Adjusting the position of a region</h3>
<p>To move a region about on the image just place your cursor some
where within the region and press and hold down button 1. Moving the
mouse now moves the region.

<h3>Adjusting the size of a region</h3>
<p>If you "select" a region (by pressing button 1 somewhere within
it), its colour will change and little boxes (called grips) will
appear somewhere on its locus. Just put your cursor over a grip, press
and hold down button 1, and then move your mouse. The shape will now
resize following your mouse about the screen.

<h3>Deleting a region</h3>
<p>To delete a region, select it and then press button 3 down when
your cursor is over the region you want to delete. A menu will now
appear. Just choose "Delete selected items" and it will be deleted.

<h3>Patching a region without an annulus</h3>
<p>Pull down the menu "Options" and select the "Fit background using
an annulus" option. This will now enable the buttons under "Add
background region:" (which should have been previous grayed out). You
can now define as many regions as you like using these buttons. When
you press the "Patch" button these regions are now used to do the
surface fit (to any regions you defined from the buttons under "Add
replacement region:") and noise estimates.

<h3>Patching non-circular regions</h3>

<p>All the shape buttons can be used to define arbitrary regions for
to be patched and to be used for the surface fit used to create the
patch.

<h3>Undoing more than one patch</h3>
<p>Sorry this isn't possible.

<h3>Patching the same regions on other images</h3>
<p>You can save descriptions of the regions you have defined into one
or two files (two are necessary when you don't use annuli for the
background). Just open the "File" menu, select the save options for
the replacement and maybe background "regions" (these are actually
saved as ARD descriptions). Now you can read these regions back after
displaying a new image (or you could also displayed these in a cloned
window, check the "New Window" option in the main windows "File" menu.
  
<h3>Selecting regions that don't want to</h3>
<p>If a region completely overlays another then it may not be possible
to select it (remember you can select a region anywhere within its
boundaries). To get around this problem to need to "lower" the region
below the one that is overlaying it. To do this place your cursor over
the obscuring region and press button 3. A menu should appear. Select
the option "Lower selected item(s)" to then try to select the region
you really want to modify.

<h3>Inspecting the details of a region</h3>
<p>Just double click over a region to get a details window that shows its
values. You can modify these and then press return to change the
region.

<h3>Inserting a new point into an existing polygon</h3>
<p>Just select the region and press button 2 over a grip. A new point
should appear which you can now adjust into the correct place.

<h3>Deleting a point from a polygon</h3>
<p>Just select the region and press button 3 over the grip you want to
delete. You cannot have less than 3 points.
