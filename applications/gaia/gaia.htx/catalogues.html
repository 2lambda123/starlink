<p>Using the facilities provided by SkyCat, GAIA is capable of using
some of the increasingly large amounts of information available via
the World Wide Web.

<p>For instance if your image has a world coordinate system associated
with it, you can query the ESO catalogue of HST guide stars about any
located within the bounds of your image. These will then be listed and
plotted over your image.  Similarly you can query the NED (NASA/IPAC
Extragalactic Database) and SAO databases (and quite a few others) and
see lists of all the objects that they know about on your image. To
see the full list of available catalogues (they are many more and more
are planned), look at the "Browse Catalog Directories..." item in the
"Data-Servers" menu.
<p align=center>

<br>
<p>Just for reference the catalogues shown in the "Catalogs" sub-menu are
only a default set loaded from a local configuration file (you can add
entries to this list using the "Add" button). Entries in the list that
are shown as type "directory", should be expanded by pressing the
associated plus sign (the names in this lists are returned from the
remote server).

<p>You can also display an image returned directly from the Digital
Sky Survey (and then perform queries in other catalogues about this
field). Named objects from certain catalogues can have their full
information displayed in Netscape and may even have bibliography links
to the ADS abstract service.  Finally the HST archives are also
available. Using these you can see what observations have been made of
any objects on your image (and preview any generally available).

Usage hints for the windows that actually display the catalogues are
available:
<ul>
<li><a href="query.html">Catalogue query windows usage hints</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It also has facilities for obtaining images (from the DSS) and for
finding out about any previous observations made by HST, NNT and the
CFHT.

<h3>Remote catalogues</h3>
<p>Remote catalogues are obtained from Web servers over the internet.
Typically these servers return object coordinates (as Right Ascension
and Declination) together with other useful information, such as
magnitudes and possibly links to bibliographic (ADS) and archive (HST,
NNT and CFHT) details.

<p>The main services used by GAIA and Skycat are provided by ESO, CADC
and LEDAS.

<p>To see a list of all the catalogues available select the "Browse
Catalog Directories..." item in the "Data-Servers" menu. This should
reveal a window containing a directory-like listing of all the
catalogues. Those marked with type "directory" may be expanded to show
their full contents by pressing the plus sign against their names.

<p>The catalogues shown outside of the site directory listings are the
default set and are those shown in the "Catalogs" sub-menus of the
"Data-Servers" menu.

<p>Queries for images of a region of sky can be made by selecting the
"Image Servers" item and queries of existing observations of a region
of sky by the "Archives" items.

<h3>Local catalogues</h3>
<p>Local catalogues are contained in files held on your local
computer. These are opened using the "Open" item in the "File" menu,
or by the "Local Catalogues" sub-menu in the "Data-Servers" menu (this
is available in the main window and in the catalogue window). Local
catalogues can be created by saving remote ones to disk (this is a
good idea when you have slow or intermittent internet access), or they
can be created by other programs (such as SExtractor -- SUN/225).

<p>The native format of local catalogues is called "tab-table". This
is a simple, plain-text, format that is described in the GAIA User
Note (SUN/214, the command <tt>showme sun214</tt> may display
this in netscape).

<p>As well as this format (which is the most efficient to use), local
catalogues can be stored in any format accessible by the CURSA
(SUN/190) package (this includes FITS-tables), and the "ASCII_HEAD"
format used by the SExtractor package.

<p>It is also possible to "import" plain text files (that is ones that
are space, comma or fixed width separated) and display them as
catalogues. To do this you need to use the "Import plain text file..."
toolbox that is found in the "Positions..." sub menu of the
"Image-Analysis" menu. There is some specific help about the toolbox
that performs the import:
<ul>
<li><a href="importtext.html">Help on using the import text file toolbox</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Finding out more</h3>
<p>If you'd like to know more about the "Data-Servers" menu then look
in the "Help" menu on the main window and select "SkyCat...". This
should start up netscape and take you to the WWW Skycat page at
ESO. There's a FAQ and some other information. The description of how
the WCS system works is largely correct, but GAIA uses a different
back-end (the Starlink AST library) which supports more formats and
the NDF WCS component. You should also note that GAIA may not be using
the latest version of SkyCat, so everything described there may not be
available.

<p>A rather more pointed description of how catalogues are served over
the web (and how to provide your own) is given in Starlink System Note
75 (SSN/75). This may be available on your local machine, or from
Starlink (try "http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/docs/ssn75.htx/ssn75.html").
