    <p>
      Integer valued masks can be used to select out regions of the displayed
      image for inspection. These must be four byte integers (not shorts) and
      have the same dimensions as the viewed image. Such masks are produced by
      the CUPID and SExtractor/EXTRACTOR packages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this toolbox is straight-forward, just identify the mask data file
      and press <tt>Apply</tt>. That will extract all regions that have
      positive non-zero values associated with them in the mask. To select a
      specific mask value either enter the value in the <tt>Values</tt> field
      and press <tt>Apply</tt>, or move to that value in the <tt>Value</tt>
      slider.
    </p>
    <p>
      To select a range of values enter these in the <tt>Values</tt> field
      using. These can be given as individual values like:
    </p>
    <pre>
      1 2 3 10 11 12
    </pre>
    <p>
      or as ranges:
    </p>
    <pre>
      1-3 10-12
    </pre>
    <p>
      To get the unmasked image back just close the toolbox or press the
      <tt>Reset</tt> button.
