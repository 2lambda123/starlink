    <p>
      Using this toolbox you can interactively display successive images from
      the planes of a cube and "spectra" for each pixel position from the
      remaining dimension. The aim is to be as efficient as possible, at these
      two jobs, and very good speed is available on machines whose physical
      memory is greater than the size of the cube.
    </p>
    <p>
      To view an image plane from the cube, just select the file containing
      the cube and then use the axis control to choose an axis to step along
      (normally this will be the dispersion/spectral axis) now either type in
      the index of the image that you want to view along that axis and press
      return or drag the slider to move through slices.
    </p>
    <p>
      To display a spectrum just click, using mouse button 1, on a position on
      the image. To see a continously updating spectrum, click and drag around
      the image.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple behaviour can be enhanced using the extra controls in the
      lower panes. Using these you can automatically step through a range of
      indices (with three options for continuous looping), or you can create a
      new image that is produced by collapsing a range of planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once an image is displayed you are free to analyse it using the usual
      tools, such as the photometric or image region toolboxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indices are what are normally known as NDF pixel indices. For FITS
      cubes this will be just the grid index (starting from 1 to the length of
      the chosen axis), for NDFs this will include the origin. If available
      the actual world coordinates being used will be displayed, together with
      a description of their meaning and units.
    <p>
    <h3>Data formats and efficiency</h3>
    <p>
      The toolbox should handle both NDF and FITS data cubes with more-or-less
      equal efficiency (NDF's may be slightly more efficient for some
      formats). Other formats will be converted into NDFs on the fly. For
      large datasets that isn't optimal, so you should convert the data
      yourself to NDF first. The CONVERT package has many applications for
      performing these conversions. If you want to use any tools that operate
      on the full cube data, rather than a plane (so that's any operations ran
      from this window, rather than any of the usual image analysis
      toolboxes), then having your data in NDF format is definitely preferred,
      as that will also involve a conversion to NDF anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
      When using some image analysis tools the currently displayed plane will
      be replaced with an actual NDF (for speed the image plane is displayed
      using a skeletal NDF with dynamically updated data, so cannot be
      directly processed by any external processes). After analysis you are
      free to continue moving through slices. A side-effect of this quest for
      speed is that the data processed by the analysis tools will not be a
      full NDF, that is it currently does not contain any addition components,
      such as variance or quality. If this is important you will need to
      extract the plane from the cube using the KAPPA task NDFCOPY, with a
      suitable NDF section (this is shown as part of the slice name in the
      main window) and open that normally in GAIA.
   </p>

    <h3>Analysing spectra</h3>
    <p>
      The simplest way to view a spectrum, for analysis, is to double click on
      the image currently displayed (this can be a slice or a collapsed
      image). Then providing you have the Starlink SPLAT program installed on
      your machine the data from the third dimension will be displayed as a
      line plot, where you can measure line strengths, compare to other
      spectra (from the VO), etc.
