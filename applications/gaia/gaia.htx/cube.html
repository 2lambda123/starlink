    <p>
      Using this toolbox you can interactively display successive images from
      the planes of a cube and <tt>spectra</tt> for each pixel position from
      the remaining dimension. The aim is to be as efficient as possible at
      these two jobs, and very good speed is available on machines whose
      physical memory is greater than the size of the cube.
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying image planes</h3>
    <p>
      To view an image plane from the cube, just select the file containing
      the cube and then use the axis control to choose an axis to step along
      (normally this will be the dispersion/spectral axis) now either type in
      the index of the image that you want to view along that axis and press
      return or drag the slider to move through slices. The data limits are
      set once for efficiency, but you can have an autocut applied to each
      slice by selecting the <tt>Autocut</tt> item in the <tt>Options</tt>
      menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple behaviour can be enhanced using the extra controls in the
      lower panes. Using these you can automatically step through a range of
      indices (with three options for continuous looping), or you can create a
      white light image that is produced by collapsing a range of planes
      (there are options to control the collapse in various ways, such as
      mean, mode, median, and integrated value, see the KAPPA COLLAPSE help).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once an image is displayed you are free to analyse it using the usual
      tools, such as the photometric or image region toolboxes.
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying spectra</h3>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="spectralplot.gif"/>
    <p>
      To display a spectrum just click, using mouse button 1, on a position on
      the image. To see a continously updating spectrum, click and drag around
      the image. You can create one <tt>reference</tt> spectrum (for comparing
      regions of the cube) by double clicking on a point. This remains
      displayed until you double click again, or change the range of value
      displayed.  See <a href="spectralplot.html">here</a> for more help on
      spectral plotting.
    </p>

    <h3>Coordinates</h3>
    <p>
      The indices used to select an image plane are what are normally known as
      NDF pixel indices. For FITS cubes this will be just the grid indices
      (starting from 1 to the length of the chosen axis), for NDFs this will
      include the origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      When your cube has a world coordinate system defined (either as an NDF
      WCS component, or as FITS headers) you will also see the coordinate of
      the current slice displayed, together with a description of its
      meaning and units.
    </p>
    <p>
      For coordinate systems that define a spectral axis, you can also choose
      to transform into other supported coordinate systems. These are listed
      in the <tt>Coords</tt> menu (currently: angstroms, nm, mm, micrometres,
      GHz, MHz, THz, KHz, J, ergs, eV, keV and 1/m, plus m/s and km/s (radio),
      if a rest frequency is defined). Just choose one and the slice
      coordinates and the spectral plot (if active) will be redisplayed to
      show your new coordinates. This menu is replicated in the spectral plot
      for convenience. To return to the initial system just choose the
      <tt>Default</tt> item.
    </p>

    <h3>Data formats and efficiency</h3>
    <p>
      The toolbox should handle both NDF and FITS data cubes with more-or-less
      equal efficiency (NDF's may be slightly more efficient for some
      integer data types). Other formats will be converted into NDFs on the
      fly. For large datasets that isn't optimal, so you should convert the
      data yourself to NDF first. The CONVERT package has many applications for
      performing these conversions. If you want to use any tools that operate
      on the full cube data, rather than a plane (so that's any operations ran
      from this window, rather than any of the usual image analysis
      toolboxes), then having your data in NDF format is definitely preferred,
      as that will also involve a conversion to NDF anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally the cube file is memory mapped to access the data. Usually this
      gives a good compromise between startup speed and access speed. However,
      for very large cubes (2Gb and up) the access speed can suffer as the
      data is only read incrementally on demand. This is particularly
      noticable when plotting spectra (which are usually accessed sparsely
      being in the third dimension), typically this manifests itself as a very
      slow response, which suddenly becomes much faster after clicking on the
      cube many times. To avoid this behaviour you can choose to read the cube
      into core memory (but make sure you have sufficient first), in one
      chunk. To do this select the <tt>Memory map cube data</tt> option in the
      <tt>Options</tt> menu (and wait a while).
    </p>
    <p>
      When using some image analysis tools the currently displayed plane will
      be replaced with an actual NDF (for speed the image plane is displayed
      using a skeletal NDF with dynamically updated data, so cannot be
      directly processed by any external processes). After analysis you are
      free to continue moving through slices. A side-effect of this quest for
      speed is that the data processed by the analysis tools will not be a
      full NDF, that is it currently does not contain any addition components,
      such as variance or quality. If this is important you will need to
      extract the plane from the cube using the KAPPA task NDFCOPY, with a
      suitable NDF section (this is shown as part of the slice name in the
      main window) and open that normally in GAIA.
    </p>

    <h3>Analysing spectra</h3>
    <p>
      The spectral display tool is just that and offers no analysis
      features. If you want to perform a measurement on a spectrum (or say
      compare it with one from the VO, or with many from the same cube) then
      you can either extract it (using some command-line tool like KAPPA
      NDFCOPY), or send it to the Starlink SPLAT-VO program (best to only do
      this when displaying NDFs). If you want to do this enable SPLAT by
      selecting the <tt>Enable SPLAT</tt> item in the <tt>Options</tt>
      menu. Once you've done that you can send a spectrum to SPLAT by double
      clicking on the relevant image pixel (note this temporarily overrides
      the default double click behaviour, which is to define a reference
      spectrum).
