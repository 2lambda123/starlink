    <p>
      Using this toolbox you can interactively display successive images from
      the planes of a cube and <tt>spectra</tt> from the remaining
      dimension. The aim is to be as efficient as possible at these two jobs,
      and very good speed is available on machines whose physical memory is
      greater than the size of the cube.
    </p>
    <p>
      3D iso-surface and volume visualisation is provided in the
      <tt>View</tt> menu.
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying image planes</h3>
    <p>
      To view an image plane from the cube, just select the file containing
      the cube and then use the axis control to choose an axis to step along
      (normally this will be the dispersion/spectral axis) now either type in
      the index of the image that you want to view along that axis (in the
      <tt>Index of plane:</tt> control) and press return or drag the slider to
      move through slices. The image display data limits are set once for
      efficiency, but you can have an autocut applied to each slice by
      selecting the <tt>Autocut</tt> item in the <tt>Options</tt> menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      The world coordinate value of the image plane displayed is shown in the
      <tt>Coordinate of plane:</tt> label and the type of coordinate, if
      available, in the <tt>Coordinate type:</tt> label. This information can
      also be shown in main window, with the image plane, if you select the
      <tt>Show coordinate label:</tt> control. That label can be moved around
      for convenience and the colour and font changed using the <tt>Label
      colour</tt> and <tt>Label font</tt> sub-menus in the <tt>Options</tt>
      menu.
    <p>
      Once an image is displayed you are free to analyse it using the usual
      tools, such as the photometric or image region toolboxes.
    </p>

    <h3>Extracting and displaying spectra</h3>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="spectralplot.gif"/>
    <p>
      <font color="red">Quick start:</font> To display a spectrum extracted
      from a point, just click, using mouse button 1, on a position on the
      image. To see a continuously updating spectrum, click and drag around
      the image. The controls in the <tt>Spectrum</tt> tab offer enhancements
      to this basic behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extraction limits along the spectral axis are the full range by
      default. To extract a smaller range of values you can use the
      <tt>Lower index:</tt> and <tt>Upper index:</tt> controls. The new
      extraction limits are not used until you click on the image again,
      or press the <tt>Re-extract</tt> button.
      To see these limits graphically (that is displayed in the spectrum that
      is already extracted), select <tt>Show limits on plot:</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as extracting a spectrum along a point (a pixel), you can
      extract a spectrum defined by a region by drawing an ARD region shape on
      the image. This is done by pressing one of the buttons <tt>Define
      region:</tt> and dragging out a shape on the image. Each value in the
      spectrum is evaluated by combining all the pixels within the region. By
      default this is just a simple mean, but you can choose a median instead
      (this option will be more suited for cleaning up flat regions of sky
      than those with gradients).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that you can draw more than one shape, but the extracted spectrum
      is just that of the selected shapes. To select more than one shape you
      click on it while holding down the control key. You should also note
      that when interacting with shapes the single pixel extraction mode is
      still enabled, so if you click off the region you will get another
      extracted spectrum. This can be confusing so you can disable this by
      deselecting <tt>Point tracking:</tt>
    </p>
    <p>
      To remove shapes from the image you need to use the <tt>Graphics</tt>
      menu options <tt>Clear</tt> or <tt>Delete</tt>. You are also free to use
      any of the other configuration options in the <tt>Graphics</tt> menu,
      like outline thickness, fill, stipple etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data limits of the extracted spectrum are fixed to the minimum and
      maximum of the pixel or region clicked on. Subsequent drags (without
      releasing) continue to use this same range. In this mode it's easy to
      compare spectra and spectral extraction is fast. If you'd like to have
      the data range always set to the minimum and maximum select the
      <tt>Options->Autoscale</tt> item in the spectral plot window. The final
      option is to fix the data range to some preset values that you'd
      like. To use this select the <tt>Fix data range:</tt> control and enter
      the data range you want. Remember to press return to apply a limit.
    </p>

    <h5>Comparing spectra</h5>
    <p>
      It is possible to have two extracted spectra on display at the same
      time. The second one is known as a reference spectrum. To create a
      reference spectrum press the <tt>Set</tt> in the <tt>Reference:</tt>
      line. This copies the currently extracted spectrum to be the reference
      one (and can be a region extracted spectrum), naturally <tt>Clear</tt>
      removes the reference spectrum. Note that the reference spectrum does
      not take part in the auto-scaling of the plot.
    </p>

    <h3>Cube handling actions</h3>
    <p>
      Other various action tabs of controls are shown in the lower pane. These
      currently allow you to animate through a range of indices, collapse the
      cube to a white-light image, create a "channel map" and subtract a
      fitted baselines.
    <p>
    <h5>Animation</h5>
    <p>
      Using these controls you can automatically step through a range of
      indices. At the end of the range you can choose to either stop
      (<tt>Off</tt>), continuously start again from the beginning
      (<tt>On</tt>) or continuously reverse direction
      (<tt>Rock 'n Roll</tt>). The limits to animate over can be controlled
      using the sliders, or you can select "Show limits on plot:" to interact
      with a graphic displayed over the spectral plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animation can be saved to an animated GIF by selecting the
      <tt>Capture</tt> item. The capture process requires that the main window
      is visible, and not overlaid by any other window. If you want to change
      the size of the animation GIF then you can only do that by resizing the
      main window. Clearly if you have a cube with many planes then that will
      take a lot of memory and time to process, so use the limits to pick out
      only the range you require. The animated GIF will be written into the
      current directory and will be called <tt>GaiaAnimation.gif</tt>, just
      move this file when you want to keep it.
    </p>
    <h5>Collapse</h5>
    <p>
      These controls run the KAPPA application COLLAPSE to create white-light
      images of various kinds. The collapse range is controlled as in the
      Animation tab. The combination method provides a wide range of methods,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <tt>Mean</tt> - Mean value </li>
      <li> <tt>WMean</tt> - Weighted mean in which each data value is weighted
        by the reciprocal of the associated variance.</li>
      <li> <tt>Mode</tt> - Modal value</li>
      <li> <tt>Median</tt> - Median value. Note that this is extremely memory
        and CPU intensive for large datasets; use with care!</li>
      <li> <tt>Absdev</tt> - Mean absolute deviation from the unweighted
        mean.</li>
      <li> <tt>Comax</tt> - Co-ordinate of the maximum value.</li>
      <li> <tt>Comin</tt> - Co-ordinate of the minimum value.</li>
      <li> <tt>Integ</tt> - Integrated value, being the sum of the products of
        the value and pixel width in world co-ordinates.</li>
      <li> <tt>Iwc</tt> - Intensity-weighted co-ordinate, being the sum of
        each value times its co-ordinate, all divided by the integrated value
        (see the <tt>Integ</tt> option).</li>
      <li> <tt>Iwd</tt> - Intensity-weighted dispersion of the co-ordinate,
        normalised like <tt>Iwc</tt> by the integrated value.</li>
      <li> <tt>Max</tt> - Maximum value.</li>
      <li> <tt>Min</tt> - Minimum value.</li>
      <li> <tt>Rms</tt> - Root-mean-square value.</li>
      <li> <tt>Sigma</tt> - Standard deviation about the unweighted mean.</li>
      <li> <tt>Sum</tt> - The total value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Chanmap</h5>
    <p>
      These controls run the KAPPA application CHANMAP to create a
      <tt>channel map</tt> image. A channel map image consists of image tiles,
      each tile being the result of collapsing a range of planes in a cube.
      These ranges are chosen to create a given number of tiles between two
      limits (which can be the whole cube).
    </p>
    <p>
      The full range for collapsing is controlled as in the Animation tab and
      same combination methods are used as in the Collapse tab (see above).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a channel-map is displayed it can have a grid overlaid, you can
      inspect the coordinates of each tile and compare positions across all
      tiles. The average values of the collapsed axis can be seen by clicking
      on a tile and inspecting the <tt>Selected coord:</tt> readout, this
      click will also result in an attempt to display a marker at the
      equivalent positions on all the other tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fuller coordinate information can also be tracked in the
      <tt>Image-Analysis->Change coordinates->Show all coordinates...</tt>
      toolbox, just track the mouse over the tile you want to investigate.
    </p>

    <h5>Rebin</h5>
    <p>
      These controls allow you to rebin the whole cube to increase the signal
      to noise, but at the expense of resolution. The rebinning can be done
      by simple summation of the data, or by taking the mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebinning is controlled by three bin factors, one for each
      dimension, so it is possible to avoid rebinning in either the
      image or spectral dimensions, if required (by setting the bin
      factor for that axis to 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The resultant cube must have a unique name (you cannot resize a
      cube on disk and then expect GAIA to sensibly reload it), so the
      a name is generated using a prefix (the default of
      <tt>GaiaTempCubeRebin</tt> will result in a new cube called
      <tt>GaiaTempCubeRebin1.sdf</tt> and so on). Prefixes that include
      the substring <tt>Temp</tt> will be deleted when GAIA closes.
    </p>

    <h5>Filter</h5>
    <p>
      These controls allow you to smooth the image planes of the cube using
      either a block or gaussian filter. The block filter can be a simple
      square or a rectangle. The gaussian filter can be symmetric or
      ellipsoidal, at a given angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When filtering using a square or rectangle filter, you must define the
      size of the edges and what method to use to combine the data. That can be
      the mean or median. Clearly the median will be useful for data that have
      spiky noise features.
    </p>
    <p>
      When filtering using a gaussian, the size of the filter is specified
      using the full width at half maximum (FWHM), but the area over which the
      gaussian is evaluated is determined by the <tt>Box size</tt>
      values. Clearly these should be set to several times the size of the
      FWHM. The orientation of the elliptical gaussian is in degrees running
      anti-clockwise from the X axis (that's to positive Y). All sizes are
      measured in pixels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cube naming scheme follows that used by the Rebin description
      (although in this case the cube size does not change).
    </p>

    <h5>Baseline</h5>
    <p>
      These controls run the KAPPA application MFITTREND to fit and subtract
      baselines from each spectrum in the cube. The baseline is estimated as a
      polynomial fit, of the selected order. Each spectrum is fitted
      independently and the data selected for each fit can include up to four
      ranges along the spectral axis. To define a range you must
      <tt>Enable</tt> it and then chose the lower and upper indices. These can
      be visualised in the spectral plot by selecting <tt>Show limits on
      plot:</tt> (in fact you can drag and resize these on the plot). Once ran
      the new cube replaces the old one and you can inspect it for success. If
      you want to keep the new cube then inspect the current directory for the
      latest file called <tt>GaiaTempCube[n].sdf</tt> (where <tt>[n]</tt> is
      some integer that increments for each new cube). This will not be
      deleted when GAIA exits (so you must do this yourself from
      time-to-time).
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3>Coordinates</h3>
    <p>
      The indices used to select an image plane are what are normally known as
      NDF pixel indices. For FITS cubes this will be just the grid indices
      (starting from 1 to the length of the chosen axis), for NDFs this will
      include the origin (this will also be true of FITS files converted from
      NDFs).
    </p>
    <p>
      When your cube has a world coordinate system defined (either as an NDF
      WCS component, or as FITS headers) you will also see the coordinate of
      the current slice displayed, together with a description of its
      meaning and units.
    </p>
    <p>
      For coordinate systems that define a spectral axis, you can also choose
      to transform into other supported coordinate systems. These are listed
      in the <tt>Coords</tt> menu (currently: angstroms, nm, mm, micrometres,
      GHz, MHz, THz, KHz, J, ergs, eV, keV and 1/m, plus m/s and km/s (radio),
      and redshift if a rest frequency is defined). Just choose one and the
      slice coordinates and the spectral plot (if active) will be redisplayed
      to show your new coordinates. This menu is replicated in the spectral
      plot for convenience. To return to the initial system just choose the
      <tt>Default</tt> item.
    </p>

    <h3>Go</h3>
    <p>
      The <tt>Go</tt> menu provides you with a quick menu of cubes that have
      been recently loaded. To revisit one just select its name in the list.
      Cubes that have been loaded in this session can also be switched back
      and forth using the <tt>Back</tt> and <tt>Forward</tt> items. When
      using these an attempt to preserve any extraction limits will be
      made. This will be perfect if the size of the spectral dimension of the
      cube doesn't change, otherwise a transformation from the old coordinates
      to the new coordinates will be attempted. That will generally be less
      precise as the coordinates will always be rounded to the nearest pixel
      position.
    </p>

    <h3>View</h3>

    <p>
      The <tt>View</tt> menu item <tt>Fits header...</tt>, will open a window
      and display any FITS headers associated with the cube (note if you look
      at the FITS headers in the main window these will only apply to the
      extracted image).
    </p>

    <h3><font color="red">Volume Visualisation</font></h3>
    <p>
      The <tt>View menu</tt> has two items for viewing and interacting with
      your cube. The first allows you to draw 3D surfaces at specified data
      values, so called <a href="isosurface.html">iso-surfaces</a>, 
      and the second to view a representation
      of the the whole cube between two data limits using 
      <a href="volume.html">volume rendering</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which tool to use depends on what aspects of your data you're trying to
      perceive, but in general since iso-surfaces are quicker to render and
      use less memory, that's probably the best tool to start with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each tool will also display the position of the current slice and the
      currently extracted spectrum (region or line) and can display 3D axes.
      They can also display additional cubes, as iso-surfaces, so that you can
      intercompare data. See the help in these windows for a fuller
      description.
    </p>

    <p>
      Volume visualisation is a CPU and memory intensive operation, so a fast
      machine with a lot of memory is required. Equally important is a good
      graphics setup with hardware support for OpenGL. If you don't have that
      slow software rendering will be used.
    <p>

    <h3>Comparing cubes</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes you'll want to inspect two related data cubes. There are two
      ways to do this. The first is to use one of the volume visualisation
      tools to draw iso-surfaces from the second cube over the first, the
      second is to display the second cube in a GAIA clone (use the
      <tt>File->New Window</tt> item in the main window) and then to select
      that clone as a slave. Do this using the <tt>Options->Slaves</tt> menu.
      At present a slave will use the same indices for positioning the slice
      and extracting a spectrum, so the cubes must have the same dimensions.
      Note a slave must already be extracting a spectrum for that control to
      work and a slave cannot enslave its master (that will force the master
      to drop the slave).
    </p>

    <h3>Contouring and cubes</h3>
    <p>
      Each plane from a cube can be contoured using the contour toolbox found
      in <tt>Image-Analysis->Contouring...</tt>. Using this toolbox you can
      also contour another image over the cube slice and the contours will
      remain displayed as you move slice, thus allowing you to compare a
      continuum image with each slice in the cube.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the reverse effect, contouring each slice over a continuum image,
      you must display your cube and image in separate windows (using the 
      <tt>File->New window</tt> item in the main window), and then open the
      contour toolbox associated with the continuum window. Now select the 
      other window displaying the cube for contouring and enter some levels.
      Contouring will now contour each slice, the speed, range and step
      between slices is determined by the values in the <tt>Animation</tt>
      section, there is also an option to just contour the current slice.
    </p>


    <h3>Data formats and efficiency</h3>
    <p>
      The toolbox should handle both NDF and FITS data cubes with more-or-less
      equal efficiency (NDFs may be slightly more efficient for some
      integer data types). Other formats will be converted into NDFs on the
      fly. For large datasets that isn't optimal, so you should convert the
      data yourself to NDF first. The CONVERT package has many applications for
      performing these conversions. If you want to use any tools that operate
      on the full cube data, rather than a plane (so that's any operations ran
      from this window, rather than any of the usual image analysis
      toolboxes), then having your data in NDF format is definitely preferred,
      as that will also involve a conversion to NDF anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally the cube file is memory mapped to access the data. Usually this
      gives a good compromise between startup speed and access speed. However,
      for very large cubes (2Gb and up) the access speed can suffer as the
      data is only read incrementally on demand. This is particularly
      noticeable when plotting spectra (which are usually accessed sparsely in
      the third dimension), typically this manifests itself as a very slow
      response, which suddenly becomes much faster after clicking on the cube
      many times. To avoid this behaviour you can choose to read the cube into
      core memory (but make sure you have sufficient first), in one chunk. To
      do this select the <tt>Memory map cube data</tt> option in the
      <tt>Options</tt> menu (and wait a while).
    </p>
    <p>
      When using some image analysis tools the currently displayed plane will
      be replaced with an actual NDF (for speed the image plane is displayed
      using a skeletal NDF with dynamically updated data, so cannot be
      directly processed by any external processes). After analysis you are
      free to continue moving through slices. A side-effect of this quest for
      speed is that the data processed by the 2D analysis tools will not be a
      full NDF, that is it currently does not contain any addition components,
      such as variance or quality. If this is important you will need to
      extract the plane from the cube using the KAPPA task NDFCOPY, with a
      suitable NDF section (this is shown as part of the slice name in the
      main window) and open that normally in GAIA.
    </p>
    <p>
      When displaying NDFs it is possible to inspect the other data
      components, variance, error and quality, by selecting the component 
      in the <tt>Options</tt> menu. If a component doesn't exist then 
      you'll just get a warning. Note that when using the 2D analysis tools 
      on the cube you'll be operating on the displayed component, not 
      the data component. The error component is the square root of the
      variance component (the standard deviation).
    </p>

    <h3>Analysing spectra</h3>
    <p>
      The spectral display tool is just that and offers no analysis
      features. If you want to perform a measurement on a spectrum (or say
      compare it with one from the VO, or with many from the same cube) then
      you can either extract it (using some command-line tool like KAPPA
      NDFCOPY, or you can save the spectrum to a simple text format -- do this
      in the <tt>File</tt> menu of the spectral plot), or send it to the
      Starlink SPLAT-VO program (for region spectra or non-NDF formats the
      spectrum will be saved to the text format before being sent).  If you
      want to do this press the <tt>Send</tt> button. This will be greyed out
      if SPLAT-VO is not available on your system.
