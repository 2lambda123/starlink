    <p>
      The CUPID package (SUN/255) analyzes images and cubes to identify
      clumps of emission. This analysis results in the production of
      catalogues that parameterize and quantify the clumps and masks that 
      record which pixels are identified with a clump. There facilities in
      GAIA for viewing both these data types in images and data-cubes.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Emission in images</h3>
    <p>
      To display a 2D catalogue you can simply open it as a local catalogue
      using the <tt>Data-Servers</tt> menu. This will display the STC-S shapes
      described in the catalogue -- these will be ellipses or polygons. You
      can use the positions and extents of the regions to display rectangles
      instead of STC-S shapes by importing the catalogue using the <tt>Import
      CUPID catalogue..."</tt> toolbox in the <tt>Image-Analysis</tt> menu.
    </p>
    <a href="cupidimport.html">Import CUPID catalogue</a>
    <p>
      Image masks can be displayed directly as images, or applied to the
      displayed image using the <tt>Mask image..."</tt> toolbox in the
      <tt>Image-Analysis</tt> menu.
    </p>

    <h3>Emission in data-cubes</h3>
    <p>
      To display a 3D catalogue you again have two options, open it as a local
      catalogue, or import it using the <tt>Import CUPID catalogue...</tt>
      option in the <tt>View</tt> menu of the cube toolbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you import it using the cube toolbox then only clumps detected on the
      current slice will be displayed. If opened as a normal local catalogue
      the sky positions of all detected clumps will be displayed without any
      regard to the coordinates of the slice.
    </p>
    <p>
      To view 3D masks you need to do a full 3D rendering. Catalogues can also
      be viewed in 3D.
    </p>

    <h3>3D rendering</h3>
    <p>
      When catalogues are imported using the cube toolbox they can be
      displayed in 3D as well. In the isophotal and volume rendering toolboxes
      (<tt>View->3D visualisation</tt>) there is a <tt>CUPID</tt> tab. Using
      that you can request that the catalogue is rendering into the scene
      (these are shown as <tt>prisms</tt>, i.e. 2D shapes protruded into the
      3rd dimension).
    </p>

    <p>
      As with imaging 3D masks can be viewed directly or used to select
      regions from the displayed cube. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Displaying masks directly is best done using the <tt>Mask &amp;
      attributes</tt> section in the <tt>CUPID</tt> controls. To do that
      select the mask, make sure <tt>Display:</tt> is selected and press
      <tt>Draw</tt>. You can choose mask values to display by entering space
      separated values in the <tt>Values:</tt> field, or by entering ranges:
      </p>
    <pre>
    1-10 20-30
    </pre>
      <p>
      etc.
      </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      To use the mask to view the associated emission in the data, do as
      above, but deselect <tt>Display:</tt> and tick <tt>Apply mask:</tt>
      in the main non-tab controls.
