        Displaying spectra and image planes from cubes</font></h2> 
    <p>
      If your data are three dimensional cubes then GAIA allows you to display
      image planes and also plot spectra from the hidden dimension, or to just
      display the whole cube as a stretched single image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default method is to open up data-cubes using the cube toolbox, that
      gives you control over which slice you want to view and enables
      interactions on the main window for extracting and plotting spectra from
      the hidden dimension (and many other tasks for collapsing to white-light
      images etc.). You can go this mode directly by selecting the "Open
      cube..." item in the "File" menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cube toolbox is described more completely in it's
      <a href="cube.html">help</a> page. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to display the cube as a stretched out series of images
      running from the bottom to the top of the image display you will need to
      start GAIA with the <tt>-check_for_cubes</tt> option set to <tt>0</tt>,
      and have a NDF format cube.
