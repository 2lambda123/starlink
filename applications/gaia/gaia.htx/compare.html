<p>There are several ways in which you can go about comparing the
appearance of two or more images.

<p>The most obvious is that you can create new image displays (see the
"New Window" item in the "File" menu) and use the window manager to
resize the displays to fit side-by-side.

<p>The second way is to "blink compare" your images (i.e. put them in
an aligned stack and radpidly cycle through them, something like
flicking through a stack of cards). Before you can blink compare you
need to display all the images in their own main windows. Now select
the "Blink images..." item in the "Image-Analysis" menu. This toolbox
has its own help description:

</ul>
<p>The third method for comparing images is by contouring. The
contouring toolbox allows you to overlay contours from one image onto
another (these can be aligned through celestial coordinates, so it's
possible to overlay images with different pixel scales and alignments,
e.g. radio maps over optical images). The contouring toolbox is
available as the "Contouring..." item in the "Image-Analysis" menu and
has its own help description:

</ul>
