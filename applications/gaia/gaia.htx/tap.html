    <h1>Query VO Registry for TAP services</h1>

    <p>
      Using this window you can find any TAP (Table Access Protocol) services
      that have been registered in the VO.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the old style R1.0 registries (from Astrogrid or the NVO) or
      the newer RegTap based ones (from GAVO at the time of writing). RegTap
      allows more flexible queries of the resources held by a registry, so is
      the default. In fact RegTap uses TAP itself, so is a more natural fit
      for queries.
    </p>

    <p>
      To select a subset of services, add some qualifying substring to select
      amongst the various titles and press <tt>Query</tt>, you can then make
      TAP queries against the tables held by that service using by opening a
      query window by either selecting a row and pressing <tt>Open</tt> or
      by double clicking on a row.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently RegTap queries do not make use of the <tt>Column:</tt>
      attribute, so changing that will not have any effect. The registries
      column searched for the substring are: <tt>short_name</tt>,
      <tt>res_title</tt>, <tt>res_subjects</tt>, <tt>ivoid</tt> and
      <tt>res_description</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have selected a suitable service. either double click on its
      name or select it and press <tt>Open</tt> that will open a further
      window in which you will enter the TAP query, but before you do that you
      may want to read the query window <a href="tapquery.html">help</a>.
