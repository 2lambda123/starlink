Welcome to the on-line help system. For help on any of the topics
shown below, click on the associated hyperlink. Descriptions and
pointers to other sources are available in the main GAIA
documentation, Starlink User Note 214. This can be view on-line either
by using the command:
    <pre>
   % showme sun214

    <h3>Do aperture photometry:</h3>
    <p>Just open the "Image-Analysis" menu and select one of the "Aperture
      Photometry" options (one toolbox works in magnitudes the other in
      straight counts/flux).
      <a href="GaiaApPhotom.html">You can get more help.</a>
    <p>

    <h3>Automatically detect all the objects:</h3>
    <p>Just select the "Detect objects..." item in the "Image-Analysis"
      menu. This creates a new toolbox with many options for controlling how
      your objects are detected and what measurements are made of them. The
      results are displayed in a catalogue window.</p>


    <h3>Define regions for use in other programs:</h3>
    <p>Just open the "Image-Analysis" menu and select "Image regions". The
      image regions created can be saved in a text file and are used by some
      KAPPA (SUN/95), CCDPACK (SUN/139) and ESP (SUN/180) applications.</p>


    <h3>Get statistics for a region:</h3>
    <p>Open the "Image-Analysis" menu and select "Image regions". Statistics
      for arbitrary regions can be obtained here. </p>

    <h3>Get statistics for an object:</h3>
    <p>Open the "View" menu and select the "Pick Object..." item. This
      creates a new toolbox that allows you to pick an object. Various
      statistics of the object are then displayed, such as its centre and
      FWHM (these are all estimated from a two dimensional gaussian fit).</p>


    <h3>Extract/remove part of the image.</h3>
    <p>Open the "Image-Analysis" menu and select "Image regions". Arbitrary
      shaped regions can be extracted or removed from images using this
      toolbox.</p>



    <h3>Use the RA and Dec stuff:</h3>
    <p>To do this you'll need an image with an appropriate set of FITS
    headers (from the Digital Sky Survey, or other on-lines sources of
    images for instance) or an NDF with a WCS component. Now when you
    move the cursor around on the image the approximate RA and Dec are
    shown.</p>

    <p>RA and Dec offsets can also be shown. Just place your cursor
    over an object and then press and hold down button 3. Now move the
    mouse to another point on the image and the offsets between then
    will be shown.</p>

    <p>No promises on how accurate any of these values are is given!
    You should also take care that the FITS headers are not
    invalidated by any manipulations you perform on the image (such as
    resizing).</p>


    <h3>Plot a grid overlay:</h3>
    <p>If your image is displaying RA and Dec values then you can also
    plot a grid overlaid on it. Just open the "Image-Analysis" menu
    and select the "Overlay axes..." item. This creates a new toolbox
    with many options for controlling the appearance of the grid.</p>


    <h3>Astrometrically calibrate my image:</h3>
    <p>
      Check out the various toolboxes under the "Astrometry
      calibration" item in the "Image-Analysis" menu. These all have
      an overview of the ways in which you can attempt this.</p>


    <h3>Change the celestial coordinate system of my image:</h3>
    <p>
      Select the "Celestial coordinates..." item in the
      "Image-Analysis" menu. This will allow you to select between
      many familiar systems.</p>


    <h3>Blink compare images:</h3>
    <p>
      To use the blink toolbox you need to display more than one
      image. To display more than one image just pull down the "File"
      menu and select the "New Window" option. A clone of the main
      window will now appear in which you can display a new image. Now
      open the "Toolboxes" menu and select the "Blink images..."
      option.</p>


    <h3>Query an on-line catalog about my image:</h3>
    <p>
      Just open the "Data-Servers" menu and select the "Catalogs..."
      item. This will create a toolbox that will allow you to select a
      catalog and then make a query about a region on the sky. If your
      image has accurate WCS information then this can be used to
      define the region, otherwise you'll need to do this yourself
      (you also need the WCS information if you want to see the
      objects returned from the catalog plotted over the image).</p>


    <h3>Display an image from the DSS:</h3>
    <p>
      Select the "Image Servers..." item from the "Data-Servers..."
      menu and either give the name of an object, or a region of the
      sky. When returned the image will be immediately displayed in
      the main window. Note that if you want to save this or perform
      analyses of the image then you must save it to a disk file and
      reload the image.</p>


    <h3>Contour an image:</h3>
    <p>
      Select the "Image-Analysis" menu and choose the "Contouring..."
      item. This will reveal a toolbox for contouring the displayed
      image and/or another image that is aligned to the displayed
      image.</p>


    <h3>Get some help, give some feedback, send a bug report:</h3>
    <p>
      Well you're reading the main help, you might also take a look at
      SUN/214 (try "showme sun214" from the command-line).  Specific
      help is given with the image processing toolboxes. Bug reports
      etc., should be sent to:
