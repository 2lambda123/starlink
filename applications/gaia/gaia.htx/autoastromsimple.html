<h3>Preliminaries</h3>

<p>Before you can use this window you need to have available the approximate
position on the sky of your image, and some good idea of its image scale (in
arcseconds per pixel). Sometimes the orientation is also required, that
depends on how well your image matches the on-line catalogue you choose.

<p>Alternatively your image may already has an astrometric calibration
that you just want to improve.

<p>Sometimes this information is available from telescope data in your image's
FITS headers, so GAIA makes an initial guess based on those that it knows
about, if you're in luck these will be shown in the appropriate fields.  You
can select values from your FITS headers using the "FITS" buttons against each
entry field.

<h4>Choosing a reference catalogue</h4>

<p>The reference catalogue should match your data in the sense that it fully
covers the part of the sky in question (obvious), it should also match the
colour, in that bright objects in the catalogue are also bright objects on
your image. If you cannot match these criteria then you'll probably get a bad
fit, or none at all.

<h4>Fitting "large" images</h4>

<p>For large images (particularly ones from CCD Mosaics) you may need to
untick "Perform linear fit" to get a fit that includes optical distortion and
also increase the number of objects used from the reference catalogue (you can
see this is needed if the just a region of the image shows matched positions
after performing a fit).


<h3>Getting a fit</h3>

<p>When you've filled in all the fields with what information you have (note
that RA and Dec values should be in the format hh:mm:ss.ss and dd:mm:ss.ss),
just press "Fit". If the fit is successful you'll get a catalogue of the
positions used in the fit displayed over the image.

<p>If that looks good enough then save the image to disk, if not then you may
need to use the advanced toolbox to fine tune the positions that are used.</p>

<h3>How is all this done, and can I do this off-line?</h3>

<p>The real work, which you may have gathered from the log information, is
actually performed by the Starlink program AUTOASTROM, which is available to
be run from the command-line. If you want to know more about AUTOASTROM look
in its documentation SUN/242. The <a href="autoastromexpert.html">
advanced toolbox</a> can display the command it uses to run AUTOASTROM.

<p>If by off-line you mean without a network connection, rather than from the
command-line, then you'll need to use the <a href="autoastromexpert.html">
advanced toolbox</a> and use a local catalogue to provide the reference
positions.
