<h3>Import a space separated text file</h3>
<p>Just choose the file and press update. Now press the "Import" tab
and you should be able to see the various columns that have been
extracted. Now go to the "Headings" tab and identify which columns
contain the ra, dec, x, y and identifier data. Leave any that you do
not have unset. Now press "Accept" (unless the "Output file:" field is
shown, in which case name the output file too).

<p>If your data have any header lines to ignore then set the "Header
lines:" value to the number to skip (note that the first line
extracted from the file is shown). You can also ignore comment lines
by defining the comment character(s). Note these must be the character
at the start of the line.


<h3>Import a comma or &lt;tab&gt; separated file</h3>
<p>This follows the same scheme as above, just select the appropriate
delimiter.

<h3>Import more complex files</h3>
<p>The only way in which you can import files that do not contain
obvious delimiters is by using fixed widths. To do this de-select the
"Use delimiter:" button, name your file and press the update
button. This will display the first (non-comment or header) line of
your file in the region just below the "Field positions:" entry.

<p>Now you need to either enter the column numbers of the start for
each field (press &lt;Return&gt; after doing this and the red
triangles will display the correct positions), or use the interactive
facilities to identify the separating columns.

<p>The red triangles identify the separations and can be moved along
the line by dragging them. New identifiers can be created by clicking
on the blue triangle and then dragging the new red triangle into
place.

<p>Red triangles can be deleted by pressing mouse button 2 over them.

<p>When you're happy with the field positions press "Update" and
examine the results in the "Import" tab. Remember to identify the
coordinate columns before exiting.
