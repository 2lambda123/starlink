<p>This window allows you to transform the set of coordinates shown in
the upper window from one celestial coordinate system to the celestial
coordinate system of the currently displayed image.

<p>To use it enter the details about the coordinate system of the
tabulated values in using the "System", "Epoch" and "Equinox" and
press the "Test" button to see what effect the transformation to the
image coordinates will have.

<p>The lower table shows the new ra and dec positions (which can also be
galactic coordinates) and what x and y values these correspond too on
the image. If these x and y positions are visible then they will be
shown as markers. 

<p>When you're happy with the transformation then press the "Accept" button 
to update the associated window, otherwise press "Cancel" if you don't 
want to accept the changes.
