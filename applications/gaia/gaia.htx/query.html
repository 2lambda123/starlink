<p>This window displays information obtained from remote and local
catalogues.  It allows you to make queries of the catalogues for
information about a region of sky, select which elements of the
catalogue are displayed and control the appearance of the associated
image markers.

<h3>Sorting by a column</h3> 
<p>Select the "Set Sort Columns..." item in the "Options" menu. This
will create a dialog window in which you can select the column that
you want to sort by. After closing this window the display will be
updated.

<h3>Selecting a range of data</h3>
<p>Select the "Set Search Columns" item in the "Options" menu. This will
create a dialog window in which you can select the name of the column
containing the values that you'd like to select by. When you close
this dialog the columns you have selected will now be shown in the
catalogue window. Just enter the upper and lower limits as shown and
press "Search". Only entries with values in this range will now be
shown.

<h3>Viewing the row associated with an object</h3>
<p>Just place the cursor over the object on the image and press mouse
button 1. This will highlight the associated data in the catalogue
window. 

<h3>Viewing the object associated with a row</h3>
<p>Just place the cursor over the row of data and press mouse button
1. This will highlight the associated object in the image window.

<p>If you can not see it press mouse button 2. This centres the main
window on the selected object (very useful for large or zoomed
images).

<h3>Removing any unplotted or off image objects</h3>
<p>If any objects are not drawn due to a plotting selection then they can 
be removed from catalogue list by pressing the <tt>Filter</tt> button.
If all objects are drawn (this is usually the case) then <tt>Filter</tt>
will remove any off-image objects instead (so a double press will remove
any undrawn objects and all off-image objects). To recover all the objects
repeat the <tt>Search</tt>.

<h3>Changing a row of data</h3>
<p>If you want to edit a row of data you must have a local catalogue
loaded. You can change a remote catalogue to a local one by saving it
to a disk file and then reopening it.

<p>To edit a row select it and then choose the "Edit selected
object..."  item in the "Edit" menu. This creates a dialog window in
which you can change the values. Remember to press the "Enter" button
before closing the window.

<h3>Removing a row of data</h3>
<p>If you want to remove a row of data you must have a local catalogue
loaded. You can change a remote catalogue to a local one by saving it
to a disk file and then reopening it.

<p>To remove a row select it and then choose the "Remove selected"
item in the "Edit" menu. You can remove a range of rows by selecting
them all first (you can select a range either by dragging, or by using
the control key to keep the current selection).

<h3>Adding a new row of data</h3>
<p>If you want to add a row of data you must have a local catalogue
loaded. You can change a remote catalogue to a local one by saving it
to a disk file and then reopening it.

<p>To add a new row to a catalogue select the "Enter new object..."
item in the "Edit menu". This creates a dialog window in which you can
enter the values. Remember to press the "Enter" button before closing
the window.


<h3>Labelling an object</h3>
<p>To label an object in the image window, just double click over the
row of data (the first column is usually used as the label).

<h3>Changing how an object is displayed</h3>
<p>Select the "Set Plot Symbols..." item in the "Options" menu. This
will create a dialog window in which you can define the shape of the
marker used to identify the object. You can also define its size,
orientation and colour. To define the size etc. you can simply enter
constants, or to achieve more complex effects, you can enter (Tcl)
expressions of the column names.

<p>To see some examples of this run the "Object detection" toolbox
selecting the options to display ellipses and circles. Now if you look
in the plot symbols window you'll see how these expressions are
created.

<h3>Using the "More" button</h3>
<p>If bibliographic information is included with your remote
catalogue, then when you select a row the "More" button will become
active. To see the details press the "More" button, this will start up
Netscape and display the page of information.

<h3>Using the "Preview" button</h3>
<p>This will be activated for data retrieved from the telescope
archives. When pressed it will obtain an "preview" of the data, if
available.

<h3>Stopping a query</h3>
<p>If you make a query to a remote catalogue, which then doesn't reply
(either because the network is too slow, or the server is down), then
press the "Stop" button to abort the query.

<h3>Clearing the object markers</h3>
<p>This can only be done using the "Clear" item of the "Graphics" menu
in the main image window. To replot the graphics press the "Plot"
button.

<h3>Saving a catalogue to a local file</h3>
<p>Just select the "Save as..." item in the "File" menu. This will
create a dialog window in which you enter a filename.

<h3>Printing the catalogue contents</h3>
<p>Just select the "Print..." item in the File menu. This option will
also allow you to save the catalogue as a plain text file (space
separated)
