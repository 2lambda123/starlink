<h2 align=center><font color=red>Image Patching</font></h2>
<p>Image patching provides the ability to select arbitrary shaped
regions on an image and replace them with a surface fit to other
arbitrary shaped regions, together with an artificial noise component.
This is an ideal way to remove unwanted defects from an image for
cosmetic reasons. Using it for other purpose should be done very
carefully.

<p><b>Note:</b> a patched image is only retained in memory, the
associated disk file is <b>not updated</b>. One consequence of this is
that toolboxes that use external programs (like photometry and object
detection) will not see the changes until after you save (and
re-display) the image. The changes to the image could also be lost
when exiting GAIA.

<p>The toolbox has some usage hints:
