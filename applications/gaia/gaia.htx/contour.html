<h3>Contouring the displayed image</h3>
<ol>
<li>Press the "Generate" tab.</li>
<li>Press the "Generate" button.</li>
<li>Press the "Draw Contours" button.</li>
</ol>
This generates some automatic levels and performs the contouring. The
levels actually used are shown in the "Level" entries. To change these
values just edit the entries and press &lt;Return&gt; or the "Draw
Contours" button (pressing &lt;Return&gt; in the entry field just redraws
that contour).

<h3>Contouring another image over the displayed image.</h3>
<p align=center><img src="contour.gif"></p>
<p>Either display the other image in another window and select it from
the "Displayed image:" menu, or enter the name of the image file into
the "Other image:" field. Now enter some appropriate contour levels
and press "Draw Contours".

<p><b>NOTE:</b> images entered in the "Other image:" field always
override displayed images. Clear this field to use a displayed image.

<p>If the images both have sky coordinates then this system will be
used for alignment, otherwise the images will be assumed to have the
same pixel coordinates. If you are using sky coordinates which cover
large areas of sky or your images are not axes aligned then you may
need to choose the "Options" menu and select the "Draw contours using
geodesics" item, you may also need to select the "Region" tab and
choose "Whole of image" for the contour region.

<h3>Printing the image plus contours</h3>
<p>Choose the "File" menu in the main window and select
"Print...". This should create a new dialog window. Just choose the
appropriate options.

<h3>Saving and restoring the contour levels etc. </h3>
<p>Choose the "File" menu and select the "Save configuration..."
item. When the file selection dialog appears choose a filename.

<p>To reload a configuration choose the "Read configuration..." item.

<h3>Setting the line thickness or colour.</h3>
<p>Each contour has its own thickness and colour. The menu associated
with each level show the possible values, just select the one you
want. Note these options are applied immediately, there is no need to
redraw the contours.

<h3>Generating contours at magnitude-like intervals.</h3>
<p>Press the "Generate" tab, select the "Algorithm" menu and choose
the "magnitude" item. Now enter the value of a reference point on your
image and an increment in magnitudes. Finally press the "Generate"
button.

<p>I use this option by entering a value somewhat above the sky
background and then setting the interval to say -0.5 (negative to get
increasing data values). The formulae used is:
<pre>
                                     (-0.4 * i * step_value)
   contour_level_i = start_value * 10
</pre>
For i = 0 up to number of contours required.

<h3>Contouring the region right to the edge of the display.</h3>
<p>Select the "Region" tab and press the "Whole of image:" button, or
alternatively increase the X and Y display fractions.

<p><b>NOTE:</b> it is much quicker to contour part of an image, this
also uses less memory.

<h3>Adding units to the contour key.</h3>
<p>Press the "Key" tab. This provides a range of options for changing
the key title, key position, colour etc. Note that the key setup is
saved as part of the configuration, so can be restored.

<h3>Moving or removing the key.</h3>
<p>To move the key just place your pointer over it, press mouse button 1
and hold it down, now move the pointer and the key will follow. 

<p>To remove the key select the "Key" tab and toggle the "Display key:"
button.

<h3>Adding contours from more than one other image. </h3>
<p>To do this you need to create a new contour toolbox. Just select
the "File" menu and choose the "New window" item.

<h3>Drawing axes around the contours.</h3>
<p>To do this you use the axis grid toolbox. Just select the
"Image-Analysis" menu in the main window and choose the "Overlay axes
grid" item. To match the regions drawn choose the "Scaling" tab and
select the "Whole of image:" button, now make the display fractions
the same size as used in the contour toolbox.
