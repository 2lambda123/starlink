    <p>
      The main use of this tool is to display image sections through a cube.
      The use is simple, just select the file containing the cube and then use
      the axis control to choose an axis to step along (normally this will be
      the dispersion/spectral axis) now either type in the index of the image
      that you want to view along that axis and press return or drag the
      slider to move through slices.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple behaviour can be enhanced using the extra controls in the
      lower panes. Using these you can automatically step through a range of
      indices (with two options for continuous looping), or you can create a
      new image that is produced by collapsing a range of planes.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Once an image is displayed you are free to analyse it using the usual
      tools, such as the photometric or image region toolboxes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The indices are what are normally known as NDF pixel indices. For FITS
      cubes this will be just the grid index (starting from 1 to the length of
      the chosen axis), for NDFs this will include the origin. If available
      the actual world coordinates being used will be displayed, together with
      a description of their meaning and units.
    <p>
    <h3>Data formats</h3>
    <p>
      The most efficient data format to use in this tool is the Starlink NDF.
      If you supply any other format data it will be converted on the fly for
      you, but for a large dataset this will not be optimal and you should
      convert it before using it in GAIA (the CONVERT program FITS2NDF
      performs this job, you should have a copy of this along with your GAIA
      installation).
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying spectra</h3>
    <p>
      The simplest way to view a spectrum is to double click on the image
      currently displayed (this can be a slice or a collapsed image). Then
      providing you have the Starlink SPLAT program installed on your machine
      the data from the third dimension will be displayed as a line plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't have SPLAT installed you use GAIA to see a slice through any
      image (see the View->Slice... menu item), so viewing a cube along any
      axis other than the spectral one means you can view a spectrum. A handy
      hint is that if you hold down the shift key when moving the end-points
      of a slice it snaps to the vertical or horizontal.
