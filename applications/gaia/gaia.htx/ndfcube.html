    <p>
      Use this control to display an image section of a cube. The use is
      simple, just select the file containing the cube and then use the axis
      control to choose an axis to step along (normally this will be the
      dispersion/spectral axis) now either type in the index of the image that
      you want to view along that axis and press return or drag the slider to
      move through slices as fast as your machine can go.
    </p>

    <p>
      The indices are what are normally known as NDF pixel indices. For FITS
      cubes this will be just the grid index (starting from 1 to the length of
      the chosen axis), for NDFs this will include the origin.
