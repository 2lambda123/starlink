<p>This window is designed to allow you to modify your image's
celestial coordinate system. The choices available cover: FK5, FK4,
FK4 with no E terms, Ecliptic, Galactic and SuperGalactic coordinates,
just choose the system that you are after using the "System:" menu
button and qualify it with an appropriate equinox and epoch, if
necessary.

<p>To apply the new system to the image press the "Test" button. This
will make the sky coordinate position readouts change, and any grid
overlay (although you can modify the coordinates that a grid is
plotted in using methods in the grid plotting window). To make the
change permanent press the "Accept" button and save the image to disk.

<p>Note this window's effects are not related to those of "Built-in
coordinates..." window. That selects from the systems already
associated with your image, this window adds a new system by
transforming from any existing celestial coordinates (so some
celestial coordinates must already be available).
