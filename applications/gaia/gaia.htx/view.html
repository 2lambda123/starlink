    <h3>Zoom:</h3>
    You can zoom the main image by one of several methods:
    <dl>
      <dd> 1) Press the button with a large "Z" on it.</dd>
      <dd> 2) Press the "Scale:" button and choose from one of the numbered
        zooms.</dd>
      <dd> 3) Place your mouse cursor into the "Pan" window (the small one on
        the upper left) and press buttons 1 and 2.</dd>
      <dd> 4) Drag out a region in the main window using shift-drag mouse
        button 1.</dd>
    </dl>
    Unzooming uses the button with a small "z", or you can pick a
    smaller number from the "Scale:" options, or finally you can press
    button 3 in the pan window. Unzooming using option 4) uses shift
    mouse button 2.
    <p>
    The zoom can only be changed by integer amounts.

    <h3>Position:</h3>
    The part of the image that you see (assuming that you cannot
    see the whole image) can be controlled by several methods:
    <dl>
      <dd>1) By dragging the scrollbars, left to right and top to bottom.</dd> 

      <dd>2) By moving the box displayed in the pan window (the small
        window on the upper left). To move this place your cursor over
        the box and then press and keep down button one -- now move the
        mouse around and finally release the button.</dd>

      <dd>3) By dragging-scrolling the main image. To do this press
        button 2 down and keep it down over the main image. Moving the
        mouse now pans the image in the same direction as the
        cursor.</dd>
    </dl>
    On slow machines 2) is probably the best option.

    <h3>Changing the image detail</h3> 
    Setting the display range (also known as the cut levels) changes
    the limits of the data that correspond to the brightest and
    faintest parts of your image. You can change the display range in
    many different ways.
    <dl>
      <dd>1) Press one of the "Auto Cut" buttons (try this first).</dd>
      <dd>2) Open the "View" menu and select the "Cut Levels ..." option.
        This show a histogram of the values in the image and allows
        some preset cuts to be applied.</dd>
      <dd>3) Type in the limits in to the "Low:" and "High:" boxes on the
        front panel. Just press <return> to activate them.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Manipulate the image colours:</h3>
    You can manipulate the displayed colours by actions in the
    colourmap display (the bar of colours in the lower part of the
    main screen). These actions are.
    <dl>
      <dd>1) Press and hold down button 1, then move the mouse side to
        side. This shifts the colourmap.</dd>
      <dd>2) Press and hold down button 2, then move the mouse side to
        side. This stretches the colourmap.</dd>
      <dd>3) Press the shift key and button 1 together and hold down,
        then move the mouse side to side. This rotates the colourmap.</dd>
      <dd>4) Pressing button 3 resets the colourmap to the
        default.</dd>
    </dl>
