    <h1>STC-S Regions</h1>

    <p>
      This toolbox provides facilities for drawing the outlines of IVOA STC-S
      regions and compound descriptions. See:
    </p>
    <pre>
      http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/STC-S.html
    </pre>
    <p>
      for the full details. STC-S has a simple syntax that allows the
      specification of the STC metadata describing a region in an astronomical
      coordinate system. For instance:
    </p>
    <pre>
      Ellipse FK5 49.9167 41.549 0.02 0.01 45
    </pre>
    <p>
      Would draw an ellipse with the given centre, semi-major and minor axes
      and postion angle in the FK5 coordinate system. Other supported shapes
      are circles, boxes and polygons. The point shape is also
      supported. Regions are entered into the toolbox as text in the main
      area, more than one region is indicated by using an empty line to
      separate them.
