    <p>
      This window is designed to allow you to select the built-in coordinate
      system used when reporting or displaying coordinates from the selected
      axis of the cube.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally these will be spectral or time coordinates, but it can be
      useful to also display simple pixel index values as well. This tool
      allows you to do that.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <tt>System:</tt> drop down menu shows all the systems that are
      available to you. Just select one to make this the current coordinate
      system. To make this change permanent just close the window using the
      <tt>Accept</tt> button. The <tt>Reset</tt> button switches back to the
      original system and <tt>Cancel</tt> closes the window after a reset.

    <p>
      NDF cubes have several coordinate systems associated with them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        GRID: the base coordinates and are a continuous system that start at
        1,1,1 for the pixel at the lower left.</li>

      <li>
        PIXEL: the same as GRID, except that the middle of the lower left hand
        pixel is 0.5,0.5,0.5. These also have any NDF pixel origins added.</li>

      <li>
        AXIS: these coordinates are those defined by any axis structures in
        the NDF. If none are present then these are the same as PIXEL.</li>

      <li>
        SKY-xxx: if present this defines a celestial coordinate system, plus
        another system, usually a spectral (DSB/SPECTRUM) or time (TIME) axis,
        but there can be other combinations, like DSBSPECTRUM-SPACEINDEX-TIME
        for JCMT ACSIS raw cubes.</li>
    </ul>
