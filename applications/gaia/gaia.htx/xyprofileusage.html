    <h2 align=center><font color=red>Mean XY Profiles Toolbox</font></h2>

    <p>This window displays the mean X and Y profiles of the image data
      bounded by the rectangle that you have drawn on the image.
      It also displays the value and position of the peak found in the
      profiles and the limits of the rectangle drawn over the main image, as
      well as providing an interactive readout of the coordinate and data
      value in the profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peak lines can be displayed in the graphs and as lines in the main
      image. These are enabled by selecting the <tt>Display peak lines</tt>
      item in the <tt>Options</tt> menu.
    </p>

    <p>Other options include the ability to stop the profiles from being
      constantly updated when you move the rectangle, which is the 
      <tt>continuous updates</tt> item (when this is switched off the profiles
      are only updated when you release the rectangle) and the ability to
      change the amount of display surface used for the two profiles. The
      later being done by selecting the little square on the line between the
      profiles and dragging it to a new position.
    </p>

    <p>The <tt>Print...</tt> option will produce a dialog which allows you to
       print a two page document to either a file or the printer. 
    </p>
    <p>The <tt>Fix data range:</tt> button fixes the data range to that
      currently displayed, so you can inter-compare regions more easily.
      To go back to auto-ranging just untick this and move the rectangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various colour and line thickness items in the
      <tt>Options</tt> menu.
    </p>

    <p>If you want to have more than one set of profiles choose the 
      <tt>New window</tt> item in the <tt>File</tt> menu.
    </p>

    <h3 align=center><font color=red>UKIRT options</font></h2>
    <p>
      When GAIA is started using the <tt>-ukirt_xy</tt> command-line option,
      this modifies the behaviour of this toolbox. The most significant changes
      are that the peak lines are displayed by default and when you display a
      new image the toolbox remains open and profiles of the new image are
      displayed (at the same image coordinates as before). Additional controls
      are also displayed for saving the positions of the rectangle and the
      peaks, as well as adding a comment to a log file.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a realtime event is received the peak position of the Y profile is
      set and a single row of values is extracted and displayed as the X
      profile. The previous profiles are also shown for comparison. When this
      happens the X profile title is changed to <tt>X Profile at Row:</tt>.
