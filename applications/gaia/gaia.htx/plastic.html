<h3>What is PLASTIC?</h3>

<p>PLASTIC stands for the <u>PL</u>atform for 
<u>AS</u>tronomical <u>T</u>ool <u>I</u>nter<u>C</u>onnection.
It is a protocol which allows tools on the desktop to communicate 
with each other.  Very briefly, the way it works is that applications
can send messages to a central <strong>hub process</strong> which will
then pass them on to other applications which can respond to them
in some appropriate way.  The messages are things like "load this table"
or "point at this position on the sky".
Applications which currently talk PLASTIC include 
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>,
<a href="http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/aladin.gml">Aladin</a>
and various tools from the
<a href="http://software.astrogrid.org/">AstroGrid project</a>.
</p>

<p>You can find more information about how it works, what applications
are compatible, and how it can be useful at the
<a href="http://plastic.sourceforge.net/">PLASTIC web site</a>.
</p>

<h3>How do I use GAIA with PLASTIC?</h3>

<p>In order for PLASTIC communications to work, a PLASTIC hub must be
running on your machine.  This is not part of GAIA and you will have
to start it up separately.  The recommended way to do this is 
currently to run the <strong>AstroGrid Workbench</strong>, 
which can be started using Java WebStart by following links on the
<a href="http://software.astrogrid.org/">AstroGrid website</a>.
</p>

<p>If the hub is running when GAIA starts up, GAIA will connect to it
("register") automatically.  
If you start the hub while GAIA is already running,
you can connect to it by selecting the "Register"
option from GAIA's "Interop" menu.  When registered,
GAIA will listen out for messages from other applications and act
on them.  If you want to stop GAIA responding to any
such messages, you can select "Unregister" from the same menu.
</p>

<p>Also on the Interop menu are options to transmit the currently loaded
image from GAIA to other tools.  The "Broadcast Image" item sends it
to all registered applications, and the "Send Image" item sends it
to just one of your choice - the submenu will show you which 
applications are capable of receiving an image.
If there are no applications currently 
registered which know how to load an image, these won't have any effect.
</p>

<p>GAIA's PLASTIC capabilities are currently rather limited.
It is hoped that in the future more options will be available,
including exchanging catalogue data with other applications.
