<h3>Image and overlay graphics</h3>
<p>To get a postscript printout of what GAIA is displaying you need to
use the "Print...", "Image..." item in the "File" menu. This creates a
dialog window as shown below. Choose the options that you require and
press "Print".

<p>For instance to get a basic colour encapsulated postscript file for
inclusion in another document, select "Color", "Landscape" or
"Portrait", "Encapsulated Postscript" and "Print to File:". Now enter
the output file name and press "Print". The result can be viewed using
a postscript viewer like ghostscript (usually the command "gv" or
"gs").

<p>The "Print whole window" option should be selected if you require a
copy of all the window, <i>including</i> any graphics that fall off
the image itself (say any axis labels drawn as part of a grid
overlay). If you use this option you should probably also set the
background colour of the image to white (do this using the "Image
background" item in the "View" menu).

<p>When you print, you can only get a copy of what you can see, any
parts of the image (or graphics) that are not visible cannot be
included in the final print. This means that you should arrange the
image view carefully (see the <a href="display.html">display
control</a> topic for advice on maximising the visible area).

<p>Another limitation is that the image is printed at the viewable
resolution (although overlay graphics are always printed using the
printer resolution), so very large images may be artificially
resolution restricted. If you suspect this is the case you'll need to
print your image some other way (such as using the "psfcol_p" or
"epsfcol_p" output devices together with the KAPPA DISPLAY program).

<h3>Colour ramp</h3>
<p>To get a representation of the colour ramp and how its values map
to your image data values use the "Print...", "Ramp..." item in the
"File menu". This produces a dialog similar to the image printing one:

Using this you can create a encapsulated postscript file for inclusion
with your image. The end result should look something like:
