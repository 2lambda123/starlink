<h4>Drawing a region</h4>
The available shapes are shown as a series of buttons along the top of
the window.
<p align="center"><img src="ard_buttons.gif">
<p>These are (running from left to right), an ellipse, a circle, an
axis aligned rectangle, a straight-line, a polygon with movable
vertices, a re-orientable rectangle, a column (one pixel wide), a row
(one pixel wide) and a single pixel.
      
<p>To actually draw a region just press on one of the shape buttons
and then put your mouse cursor over the image. Press and hold down
button 1 and then move the mouse. The action you will now get depends
on the type of region.
      
<p>To complete a polygon double click button 1.
      
<h4>Blanking out parts of the image</h4>
<p>You can blank out parts of the image by pressing the "Blank
selected" or "Blank all" buttons. The new image that is generated is
either displayed in a new clone window, or in the existing display.
      
<h4>Extracting parts of the image</h4>
<p>Use the "Extract selected" and "Extract all" buttons. Extra space
around the useful parts of your images can now be removed using the
"Auto crop" button.
<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
<ol>
<li>Once you've extracted the image it appears in a new window, you need
to open a regions toolbox for that window, before attempting to
autocrop.
<li>If you select the "Display new images in existing window" item in
the "Options" menu then, then the new image will be displayed in this
window, saving the need for this extra difficulty.
</ol>

<h4>Stopping the creation of new windows</h4>
<p>If you want to display the results of a blank or extract operation
in the existing window then open the "Options" menu and make sure that
the "Display new image in existing window" option is selected.

<h4>Getting statistics on regions</h4>

<p>Use the buttons "Stats selected" and "Stats all". The statistics for either
just the selected regions or all the displayed regions are then calculated and
displayed in the text output window. Note that any bad values in the image are
excluded from these statistics, so the number of pixels reported is the number
of non-bad ones, not the total number in the region.

<p>The statistics can be saved into a plain text file. This just writes the
contents of the text output window to the file named in the "Stat results
file:" entry.

<h4>Moving a region</h4> 
<p>Just put your mouse cursor over the region you want to move and press
button 1. The region should now become "selected" (you can see this as the
colour changes and grips appear). If you hold down button 1 and then move the
mouse the shape will move.
      
<h4>Adjusting a region</h4>
<p>First select the region that you want to adjust. Little boxes
should now appear on its locus (these are called grips). Place your
cursor over a grip, press and hold down button 1 and then move your
mouse. The region should now adjust its shape.

<h4>Saving the regions</h4>
<p>Open the "File" menu and select "Save ARD description...". A file
selection window should now appear and you can enter a new name or
overwrite an existing file. The description of the regions on the
image is stored in ARD format (Ascii Region Description -- SUN/183).
Or exported as an IVOA Multi-Order Coverage (MOC) region. These
can be re-read into GAIA using the MOC toolbox.

<h4>Restoring regions</h4>
<p>Use the "Read ARD description..." option in the "File" menu. Note
that in general only ARD descriptions created by this toolbox will be
restorable. You may be able to read files created by programs such as
KAPPA ARDGEN, but only simple ones.

<h4>Selecting regions that don't want to</h4>
<p>If a region completely overlays another then it may not be possible
to select it (remember you can select a region anywhere within its
boundaries). To get around this problem to need to "lower" the region
below the one that is overlaying it. To do this place your cursor over
the obscuring region and press button 3. A menu should appear. Select
the option "Lower selected item(s)" to then try to select the region
you really want to move.

<h4>Deleting a region</h4>
<p>Place your cursor over the region you want to delete, select it (by
pressing button 1), then press button 3. A menu should appear. Choose
the "Delete selected item(s)" option.

<h4>Inspecting/setting the exact details of a region</h4>
<p>Just double click over a region to get a details window that shows
its values. You can modify these and then press return to change the
region.

<h4>Inserting a new point into an existing polygon</h4>
<p>Just select the region and press button 2 over a grip. A new point
should appear which you can now adjust into the correct place.

<h4>Deleting a point from a polygon</h4>
<p>Just select the region and press button 3 over the grip you want to
delete. You cannot have less than 3 points.

<h4>Selecting more than one region</h4>
<p>Just hold down the Control button while selecting each region.

<h3>Related programs</h3>
<p>This toolbox makes use of several external programs that perform
services on the displayed image. These are: KAPPA ARDMASK, GAIA
ARDSTATS and GAIA AUTOCROP. You should note that these programs work
on the disk-resident image data not the displayed data.
