    <p>
      This window displays a line plot (a spectrum) made from the pixel values
      along the hidden dimension of a cube. You have usually created it by
      opening a cube and then clicking on a pixel from the displayed image
      slice. It can be updated by clicking on another pixel (each click
      auto-scales the display values) or continuously updated by clicking and
      then dragging over the image, while holding the mouse button down.
    <p>
      To get the data range updated continuously (which will be much slower)
      you can selection the <tt>Autoscale</tt> item in the cube toolbox
      <tt>Options</tt> menu. If you want to zoom on a region you can currently
      only do this using the collapse limits in the cube toolbox. Set these to
      the pixel ranges required, click on the image and only spectral values
      from that range will be displayed (both these arrangements may change in
      the next release).
    </p>
    <p>
      When looking at a spectrum the position of the current slice in the cube
      is shown by a vertical line (red by default). This will updated as you
      move through the cube slice-by-slice (the position of the spectrum on
      the image is shown by a cross).
    <p>
    <p>
      You are free to close this window at any time as it will be reopened (if
      you click on the image) if the cube toolbox is active. It can also (like
      all GAIA windows) be resized.
    </p>

    <h3>Taking a hardcopy</h3>
    <p>
      To either print a copy of the spectrum or save a copy to disk you can
      use the <tt>File</tt> <tt>Print</tt> option. Using the various options
      in the <tt>Options</tt> and <tt>Graphics</tt> menu you can change the
      various colours and fonts in use and add temporary annotations.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Why doesn't the log option work?</h3>
    <p>
      For either axis to be drawn using log spacing the limits cannot include
      the value zero. When this is detected the axes are drawn using a linear
      spacing.
