    <p>
      This window displays a line plot (a spectrum) made from the pixel values
      along the hidden dimension of a cube. You have usually created it by
      opening a cube and then clicking on a pixel from the displayed image
      slice. It can be updated by clicking on another pixel (each click
      auto-scales the display values) or continuously updated by clicking and
      then dragging over the image, while holding the mouse button down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two spectra can be displayed at the same time by defining a
      <tt>reference spectrum</tt> by double clicking on a position in the
      displayed image. This can be replaced at anytime by simply double
      clicking again. Note that the reference spectrum is not considered when
      autoscaling the plot limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the data range updated continuously (which will be much slower)
      you can selection the <tt>Autoscale</tt> item in the <tt>Options</tt>
      menu. If you want to zoom on a region you can currently only do this
      using the collapse limits in the cube toolbox. Set these to the pixel
      ranges required, click on the image and only spectral values from that
      range will be displayed (both these arrangements may change in the next
      release).
    </p>
    <p>
      When looking at a spectrum the position of the current slice in the cube
      is shown by a vertical line (red by default). This will updated as you
      move through the cube slice-by-slice (the position of the spectrum on
      the image is shown by a cross). You can also move through slices by
      dragging this line around, other reference lines created by the cube
      toolbox can also be dragged around.
    <p>
    <p>
      You are free to close this window at any time as it will be reopened (if
      you click on the image) if the cube toolbox is active. It can also (like
      all GAIA windows) be resized.
    </p>

    <h3>The Coords menu</h3>
    <p>
      For cube coordinate systems that define a spectral axis, you can also
      choose to transform into other supported coordinate systems. These are
      listed in the <tt>Coords</tt> menu (currently: angstroms, nm, mm,
      micrometres, GHz, MHz, THz, KHz, J, ergs, eV, keV and 1/m, plus m/s and
      km/s (radio), if a rest frequency is defined). Just choose one and the
      plot and slice coordinates will be redisplayed to show your new
      coordinates. This menu is replicated in the cube toolbox plot for
      convenience. To return to the initial system just choose the
      <tt>Default</tt> item.
    </p>
    <p>
      When your data do not describe a spectral axis the items in the
      <tt>Coords</tt> menu will be greyed out.
    </p>

    <h3>The Options menu</h3>
    <p>
      There are various items available in this menu that mostly effect the
      presentation of the spectrum. <tt>Autoscale</tt> is described above,
      the log options should be obvious (but see the gotcha below) as should
      the various presentational ones (which are useful when creating
      hardcopies). The <tt>X min to max</tt> item controls how the X axis of
      the plot is draw. When selected the minimum X coordinate will appear on
      the left and the maximum on the right. For your data this might
      correspond to the order of coordinates from the <tt>front</tt> to the
      <tt>back</tt> of the cube, or it may not. Deselecting this always places
      the coordinate from the front of the cube to the left.
    </p>

    <h3>Taking a hardcopy</h3>
    <p>
      To either print a copy of the spectrum or save a copy to disk you can
      use the <tt>File</tt> <tt>Print</tt> option. Using the various options
      in the <tt>Options</tt> and <tt>Graphics</tt> menu you can change the
      various colours and fonts in use and add temporary annotations.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Why doesn't the log option work?</h3>
    <p>
      For either axis to be drawn using log spacing the limits cannot include
      the value zero. When this is detected the axes are drawn using a linear
      spacing.
