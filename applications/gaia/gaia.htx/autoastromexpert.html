<h3>Preliminaries</h3>

<p>The basic requirements and usage of this toolbox are the same as those of
the <a href="autoastromsimple.html">simple version</a>. To use these advanced
features it is strongly suggested that you also read the AUTOASTROM document
SUN/242.

<h3>Advanced features</h3>

<p>The main features that this offers over those of the simple toolbox are:
<ul>
      <li>using a pre-calculated catalogue of detections,</li>
      <li>using a local catalogue as a reference catalogue,</li>
      <li>supplying a full set of observation parameters,</li>
      <li>switching between the FINDOFF and MATCH algorithms,</li>
      <li>using a 7 parameter fit, not just 6 or 9,</li>
      <li>configuration of the defect removal stage,</li>
      <li>log of the commands used to run AUTOASTROM.</li>
</ul>

<h3>AUTOASTROM overview</h3>

<p>Here's a very simplified run-down of what AUTOASTROM does, it should help
you understand how to use this toolbox effectively:
<ul>
      <li>Stage 1: a catalogue of object positions on your image is
      obtained. This should be the output of a run of EXTRACTOR (SUN/243)
      formatted in the correct way (i.e. with the right columns available). By
      default AUTOASTROM runs this program for you, but you can provide your
      own pre-determined catalogue.</li>
      
      <li>Stage 2: a catalogue of reference positions on the sky is obtained
      using your initial estimate of the position on the sky. Usually you
      tell AUTOASTROM about one of the known on-line catalogues you'd like to
      use (USNO, GSC etc.) which it then proceeds to obtain a download from,
      but again you can provide your own local copy.</li>

      <li>Stage 3: the two catalogues are matched. There are two algorithms
      available to perform this most tricky part, one based on triangle
      tessellations, the other on simple pair offsetting.</li>

      <li>Stage 4: the matched positions (sky against image coordinates) are
      used to determine the astrometric solution using the ASTROM (SUN/5)
      program.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this last stage the solution is attached to your image by GAIA (at
this time in memory only) and the catalogue of matched positions is plotted
over the image.

<h3>Using a pre-calculated detection catalogue</h3>

<p>AUTOASTROM runs the EXTRACTOR (SUN/243) program to detect all the objects
in your image, if you need to fine tune the detection parameters (say to
reduce the number of objects detected), then you can use the GAIA "Object
detection" toolbox to pre-calculate the object positions. To do this open a
"Object detection" toolbox and selected the "AUTOASTROM mode" from the
"Options" menu. Once you've created your catalogue of detections is should be
selectable in the "Detection catalogue" menu (note that catalogues only become
available in this menu when they are opened in a catalogue window).

<h3>Using a local reference catalogue</h3>

<p>You can download or read in an existing catalogue and get AUTOASTROM to use
that as the reference positions catalogue. Obviously this has two advantages,
you get to pre-select the reference positions being used (useful if you know
stars with significant proper motions are in the field) and you can work
off-line.

<p>To download a catalogue when the image doesn't have a WCS already you will
need to use a clone window (all catalogues regardless of the image they are
attached to are made available, so it doesn't matter where you open this
catalogue). You should leave the clone window empty (i.e. not displaying an
image) and the download will not be constrained to the displayed image.

<h3>Fine tune the fit</h3>

<p>The options in the "Observation" and "Tuning" tabs allow you to provide the
full set of AUTOASTROM options, read the AUTOASTROM and ASTROM documentation
to understand how these effect your fit.

<p>You can also improve your fit by re-using the match catalogue as the
reference catalogue for the next run. The match catalogue includes a column
that contains the shift in position, so you could sort on this and remove any
obvious problem objects (like high motions stars, galaxies blends etc.),
before re-fitting.
