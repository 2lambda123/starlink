      Using this window you can select Cone servers and query them about any
      information they have on a region on the sky. To select a server just
      double click on its entry or select its entry and press <tt>Open</tt>.
      Once open you can then go on to define a region of sky to query and
      display markers at any positions that are on the displayed image.

      To get a list of services that are related to some topic you're
      interested in you need to send a query to the registry of services.
      To do that just press the <tt>Query</tt> button after entering some 
      string inthe <tt>Substring</tt> entry. Usually that is a constraint on
      the catalogue service title, but you can change the <tt>Column</tt>
      to other values, like shortName.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general it shouldn't matter which registry you choose to query, as
      they all replicate, so pick one that is "nearest" to you. Europeans
      should probably pick <tt>Astrogrid</tt>.
