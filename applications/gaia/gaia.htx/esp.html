<p>Extended surface photometry is performed using the "Surface
photometry..." toolbox that is found in the "Image-Analysis" menu.
<p>
This toolbox allows the interactive identification of extended
objects (galaxies) and profile measurements using ellipse fitting. The
resultant fits are shown over the images and the measurements can be
inspected. It is based on the ESP (see Starlink User Note 180)
programs ELLPRO and ELLFOU.
