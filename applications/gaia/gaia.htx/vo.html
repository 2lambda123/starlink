      Currently access to VO resources cover catalogues using so called cone
      search (CS) and images using simple image access protocol
      (SIAP). Toolboxes for accessing these are found in the "Data-Servers"
      menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two toolboxes offer differing approaches to accessing resources, but
      fundamentally work the same way: locate what services are available by
      querying a registry and then querying individual services for a
      catalogue or image that covers a given region of sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      VO resources are registered in a registry, so typically you find what
      services are available for a service type by initially querying the
      registry. To avoid this overhead GAIA has a cached version of a full
      registry response, but typically you'll want to refine these lists using
      additional constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of images, for which there are fewer servers and generally
      you'll only want a single image at a time, this step needs to be
      accessed using "View image servers..." dialog in the toolbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      For catalogues, of which they are many, restricting the list of services
      is a more immediate need, so this forms the first part of the dialog.
