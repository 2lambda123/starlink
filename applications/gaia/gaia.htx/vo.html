    <p>
      Currently access to VO resources cover catalogues using so called cone
      search (CS), Table Access Protocol (TAP) and images using simple image
      access protocol (SIAP). Toolboxes for accessing these are found in the
      "Data-Servers" menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various toolboxes offer differing approaches to accessing resources,
      but fundamentally work the same way: locate what services are available
      by querying a VO registry and going on to query individual services for
      catalogue results or images. For the cone and image services these will
      cover a given region of sky, usually the displayed image.
    </p>
    <p>
      VO resources are registered in a registry, so typically you find what
      services are available for a service type by initially querying the
      registry. To avoid this overhead GAIA has a cached version of a full
      registry response, but typically you'll want to refine these lists using
      additional constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      How you query registries has developed over time, so currently two types
      of registry query are provided. The old style R1.0 is no longer the 
      default as it is less flexible than the newer "RegTap" based ones 
      (the flexibility comes from being able to query the registry in the 
      same way that you query a TAP service, using ADQL, although the details
      of that are hidden for convenience).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of images, for which there are fewer servers and generally
      you'll only want a single image at a time, this step needs to be
      accessed using "View image servers..." dialog in the toolbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      For cone search catalogues, of which they are many, restricting the list
      of services is a more immediate need, so this forms the first part of
      the dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      TAP services allow you to query many of the same catalogues as through
      the cone search, but using the full power of ADQL, the Astronomical
      Data Query Language, a subset of SQL with Astronomy specific support.
