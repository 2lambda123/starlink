#   Name:
#      gaiaremote
#
#   Purpose:
#      Sends a remote command to an rtd widget.
#
#   Usage:
#      gaiaremote command
#
#   Description:
#      This procedure sends a command, using the RTD remote
#      control mechanism, to an instance of GAIA. It does not use the
#      Tk send mechanism, so provides a secure method of controlling
#      GAIA without any X security problems (but the commands set if
#      more restrictive).
#
#      If an instance of GAIA cannot be located a new one is started.
