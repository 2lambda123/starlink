      SUBROUTINE RTD1_SETAR( START, STEP, SIZE, ARRAY, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     RTD1_SETAR

*  Purpose:
*     Sets the values of an array to an incremented range of values.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran-77.

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RTD1_SETAR( START, STEP, SIZE, ARRAY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine fills an array with values starting at START and
*     incremented between each element by STEP. It's really just 
*     a convience for setting dynamically allocated arrays.
*
*     The result is:
*        ARRAY( I ) = START + ( I - 1 ) * STEP

*  Arguments:
*     START = REAL (Given)
*        Value of first element in ARRAY.
*     STEP = REAL (Given)
*        Increment for each pixel.
*     SIZE = INTEGER (Given)
*        Size of the array ARRAY.
*     ARRAY( SIZE ) = REAL (Returned)
*        Array with all elements set up with incremented values.
*     STATUS = INTEGER ({status_access_mode})
*        The global status.
