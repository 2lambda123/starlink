      SUBROUTINE GAI1_NXTAB( STR, ISTART, IFOUND, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GAI1_NXTAB

*  Purpose:
*     Locate the next occurence of the TAB character.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GAI1_NXTAB( STR, ISTART, IFOUND, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine locates the next occurence of a <TAB> character in
*     the given string, starting from a given position. If found the
*     IFOUND argument will be set to the position of the <TAB> character
*     within the string. If a <TAB> character is not found, but the
*     string contains non-blank characters after that point then IFOUND
*     will be set to the last non-blank character plus 1. If all remaining
*     characters are blank then IFOUND will be set to 0.

*  Arguments:
*     STR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The string to be searched.
*     ISTART = INTEGER (Given)
*        The starting point from which elements of STR are searched.
*     IFOUND = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The position of the <TAB> character, or the end of the 
*        string + 1 if no <TAB>'s are located and the remaining string isn't
*        blank. Otherwise it will be set to 0.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
