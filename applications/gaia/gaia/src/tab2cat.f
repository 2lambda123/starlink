      SUBROUTINE TAB2CAT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     TAB2CAT

*  Purpose:
*     Converts a "tab table" into a CAT catalogue.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL TAB2CAT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This program converts a disk file containing a "table tab" into a
*     CAT catalogue (see SUN/181).
*
*     At present this application can only work well with tab tables
*     produced by the "cat2tab" application. Which encodes enough
*     information to automatically regenerate the data types etc. of the
*     fields. If this isn't the case then an attempt is made to
*     re-generate much of the information about data types (see
*     GAI1_T2CG). 

*  Usage:
*     TAB2CAT IN OUT

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IN = _CHAR (Read)
*        Name of the input tab-table catalogue.
*     OUT = _CHAR (Read)
*       Name of the output CAT catalogue.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     - Doesn't even attempt to work on catalogues produced by anything
*       other than cat2tab.
