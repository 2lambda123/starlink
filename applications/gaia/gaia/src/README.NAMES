The names used in GAIA are a bit odd. Originally GAIA was based on RTD
and I didn't know what it would eventually be called. So some parts
where called "Star..." and some "rtd...". Now that GAIA is called GAIA
and is really based on Skycat (which is based on RTD), I intend to
change all the names so that RTD and Star are replaced by GAIA, but
only when routines are modified, so this may take sometime.
