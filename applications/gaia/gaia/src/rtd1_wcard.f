      SUBROUTINE RTD1_WCARD( CARD, NCARD, BLOCK, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    RTD1_WCARD

*  Purpose:
*     Writes a FITS card without checking.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RTD1_WCARD( CARD, NCARD, BLOCK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine writes a FITS card  into the "FITS block" by
*     appending it just before the 'END' keyword. No checking is 
*     made.

*  Arguments:
*     CARD = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The complete CARD to copy into the FITS block.
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements (cards) in BLOCK.
*     BLOCK( NCARD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The FITS block (note this is passed at this point so that it is
*        before the other *(*) characters which allows this array to be
*        mapped -- see SUN/92).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
