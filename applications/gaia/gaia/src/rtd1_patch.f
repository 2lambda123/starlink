* Name:
*    RTD1_PATCH

*  Purpose:
*     Patches a region of an image.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran-77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RTD1_PATCH( FITGRP, NEWGRP, SCALE, NFIT, LBND, UBND,
*                      DIM1, DIM2, TYPE, HAVVAR, IPVAR, IPIMG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine replaces the pixels with a given ARD region by a
*     function that is derived by a polynomial fit to pixels in another
*     region (this region is also made to exclude any pixels from
*     the first region). A noise parameter is derived from the
*     polynomial fit and is used as a estimate of the standard
*     deviation of a gaussian distribution that is applied to the
*     polynomial replacemebt values. The added noise (which may be
*     scaled if the fit estimate isn't good enough) makes the
*     replaced region look like a genuine part of the image.
*
*     The input data may be of any non-complex numeric HDS type
*     and may have noise estimates (variances) associated with them.
*     The variances of any replaced pixels are set to the standard
*     deviation of the noise distribution.
*
*     If given then the quality array (whose limits are the same as the
*     image data) will have any changed pixels BADBITS reset.

*  Arguments:
*     FITGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*       ARD description of region to fit surface to.
*     NEWGRP = INTEGER (Given)
*       ARD description of region to replace (patch). This region
*       is also excluded from FITGRP.
*     SCALE = REAL (Given)
*       Scaling factor to apply to noise estimates.
*     NFIT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The order of the surface fit.
*     LBND( 2 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The lower bounds of the NDF section corresponding to IMAGE.
*     UBND( 2 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The upper bounds of the NDF section corresponding to IMAGE.
*     DIM1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        First dimension of the data array.
*     DIM2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Second dimension of the data array.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The numeric type of the data pointed to by IPIMG. Any
*        variances are also assumed to be in this type.
*     HAVVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether or not any variances are available for the image
*        data. These are used as weights in the surface fit.
*     IPVAR = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to variance data if it exists. Replaced pixels are
*        modified to the standard deviation of the replacement
*        function.
*     HVQUAL = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether or not a quality array has been given.
*     IPQUAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the quality data.
*     BADBIT = BYTE (Given)
*        BADBITS mask of quality data.
*     IPIMG = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Image data to be modified.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
