      SUBROUTINE RTD1_WNDFH( NDF, IPHEAD, NHEAD, AVAIL, BITPIX,
     :                       CMPTHE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     RTD1_WNDFH

*  Purpose:
*     Writes out the mandatory and axis FITS header cards derived from
*     an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RTD1_WNDFH( NDF, IPHEAD, NHEAD, AVAIL, BITPIX, CMPTHE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine writes the mandatory and the optional but reserved
*     header cards into a primary header and data unit.  The values for
*     the keywords of the header cards are determined from the supplied
*     NDF.  The routine records which of the optional headers cards are
*     defined.

*     The keywords are:
*        o  NAXIS, and NAXISn are derived from the dimensions of
*           the NDF data array.
*        o  For an NDF whose origin is not the default LBOUNDn
*           cards are written. (These are not part of the standard.)
*        o  The OBJECT, LABEL, and BUNIT keywords are derived from
*           the TITLE, LABEL, and UNITS NDF components.
*        o  The CDELTn, CRPIXn, CRVALn keywords are derived from a
*           set of linear NDF AXIS structures.  Whenever the NDF AXIS
*           structure contains units or a label CUNITn and CTYPEn
*           keywords are created repsectively.
*        o  DATE card is written.
*        o  A BLANK card is written using the standard bad value
*           corresponding to the type of the DATA array, but
*           only if BAD pixels are present.
*        o  Dummy BSCALE and BZERO cards are written with values 1.0 and
*           0.0 respectively.
*        o  The standard order of the FITS keywords is preserved.

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF.
*     IPHEAD = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to the FITS block.
*     NHEAD = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of header cards used.
*     AVAIL = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of header cards available.
*     BITPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The BITPIX value for the output FITS file.
*     CMPTHE( NFLAGS ) = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        The flags when set to true indicate that certain optional NDF
*        components have been used to write descriptors to the NDF.
*        In order they are 1) TITLE, 2) LABEL, and 3) UNITS.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
