      SUBROUTINE RTD1_ETERP<T>( DX, DY, NX, NY, DATA, INDX, SWAP, SPEC )
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C  Subroutine to do Everett interpolation.  INITEI should be called once
C  with the order of the interpolation desired to set up variables in
C  common before any subsequent calls to this routine.
C  INPUTS:
C    DX      R*4      X position.
C    DY      R*4      Y position.
C    NX      I*4      Number of X pts in DATA.
C    NY      I*4      Number of Y pts in DATA.
C
C    DATA    <TYPE>   Image data array.
C    INDX    I*4      Index of SPEC to place result
C  OUTPUTS:
C    SPEC    <TYPE>   Interpolated value.
C  Note: This routine is based closely on the routine ETERP from the AIPS
C  program SLICE, but has been simplified for Figaro since it can now
C  assume that all the data array is available.
