      SUBROUTINE RTD1_DEWCS( HEAD, NHEAD, EAT, IWCS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     RTD1_DEWCS

*  Purpose:
*     Decodes an WCS system from FITS headers.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RTD1_DEWCS( HEAD, NHEAD, EAT, IWCS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine processes a FITS header character array, looking for
*     an encoded WCS which it returns as an AST FrameSet (suitable for
*     writing to an NDF component). The headers are scanned using the
*     normal sequence of encoding priorities (so Native, the most
*     accurate, are scanned for first, followed by FITS-WCS). If a 
*     Native system is encountered and EAT is true, then this is removed
*     permanently by the read (should only keep this in the NDF WCS
*     component and any FITS WCS information in the FITS header).

*  Arguments:
*     HEAD ( NHEAD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        Character array that contains some FITS headers that may
*        contain a WCS system. On exit these may be updated to remove an
*        AST native encoding.
*     NHEAD = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of cards in the input header.
*     EAT = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If TRUE and the FITS headers contain a AST native encoding,
*        then this is removed from the headers and NHEAD is updated to
*        the new value.
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Returned)
*        AST identifier to the decoded FrameSet. This is set to
*        AST__NULL if none is found.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
