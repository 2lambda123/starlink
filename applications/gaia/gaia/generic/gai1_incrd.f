      SUBROUTINE GAI1_INCRD( CARD, IPHEAD, NHEAD, ICARD, AVAIL, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    GAI1_INCRD

*  Purpose:
*    Inserts a FITS card.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GAI1_INCRD( CARD, IPHEAD, NHEAD, AVAIL, STATUS)

*  Description:
*     This routine inserts a FITS card without any checking of the
*     format etc.

*  Arguments:
*     CARD = CHARACTER * ( 80 ) (Given)
*        The complete FITS card to write.
*     IPHEAD = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to FITS block.
*     NHEAD = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Number of cards written to in block.
*     ICARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index to insert card at.
*     AVAIL = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Number of cards available in FITS block.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Note the %VAL(80)'s following the last genuine arguments of certain
*  calls. This is the usual method used by compilers for passing the
*  lengths of strings on UNIX and needs to be used here since the
*  characters are mapped.

*  If necessary extend the FITS block in memory to allow for extra cards.
