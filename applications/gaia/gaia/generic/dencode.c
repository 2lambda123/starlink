 *  Name:
 *     dblEncode
 
 *  Purpose:
 *     Encode a double precision value as a string.
 
 *  Description:
 *     This routine encodes a double precision value as a string. It
 *     is used instead of the normal Fortran internal write (G24.17)
 *     as this is broken on Linux for numbers with exponents larger
 *     than E+99.
 
 *  Synopsis:
 *     CALL DENCODE( VALUE, STRING )
 
 *  Authors:
 *     PWD: Peter W. Draper (Starlink, Durham University)
