      SUBROUTINE RTD1_CHEAD( IN, NEL, OUT, STATUS )
*+
* Name:
*    RTD1_CHEAD

*  Purpose:
*     Writes an output FITS header from an existing one.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RTD1_CHEAD( IN, NEL, OUT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine copies a 1D character array of a given size into
*     another (which must be at least as big). The contents are assumed
*     to be FITS cards, which have been created by GAIA. A check is made
*     to ensure that the special NDFID, LBOUND1 and LBOUND2 cards are 
*     not written out.

*  Arguments:
*     IN( NEL ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The input FITS block (from GAIA).
*     NEL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of elements (cards) in IN.
*     OUT( NEL ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The output FITS block.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Arguments Returned:

*  Status:
      INTEGER STATUS            ! Global status

*  Local Variables:
      INTEGER I                 ! Loop variable
*.

*  Check inherited global status.
      IF ( STATUS .NE. SAI__OK ) RETURN

*  Copy the whole of the input character array to the output one.
*  Unless the card is one that shouldn't be propagated.
