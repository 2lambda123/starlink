      SUBROUTINE RTD1_CRFIT( NDF, BITPIX, NHEAD, IPHEAD, AVAIL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     RTD1_CRFIT

*  Purpose:
*     Writes the FITS header derived from an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RTD1_CRFIT( NDF, BITPIX, NHEAD, IPHEAD, AVAIL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine creates the header section of the primary array or
*     IMAGE extension of an output FITS file based upon information in
*     an NDF.

*     There are two stages:
*     a) Inquire of the NDF its shape, type, character components,
*     and write these to the header.
*     b) Look for a FITS extension if requested to do so.  If one is
*     present append the headers contained therein to the FITS header
*     section, but not replacing any of the headers created in stage
*     a).

*  Arguments:
*     NDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The identifier of the NDF.
*     BITPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The FITS data type.
*     NHEAD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        On exit this is the number of cards used in HEADER.
*     IPHEAD = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Pointer to a character array that contains the final FITS
*        headers.
*     AVAIL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of header cards actually allocated on exit.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     Here are details of the processing of standard items from the
*     NDF into the FITS header:
*        SIMPLE, EXTEND, PCOUNT, GCOUNT --- all take their default
*          values.
*        BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXISn --- are derived directly from the NDF
*          data array;
*        OBJECT, LABEL, BUNIT --- the values held in NDF TITLE, LABEL,
*          and UNITS respectively are used if present, otherwise any
*          s found in the FITS extension are used.
*        ORIGIN and DATE --- are created automatically.  However the
*          former may be overriden by an ORIGIN card in the NDF
*          FITS extension.
*        BSCALE, BZERO, BLANK and END --- are not propagated
*          from the extension.  The first will be set for any extension.
*          BSCALE and BZERO are 1 and 0.  BLANK is set to a character
*          string of the BAD value for this data.

*  History:
*     1994 May 31 (MJC):
*        Original version.
*     1995 November 16 (MJC):
*        Fixed a bug that could occur in some circumstances when the a
*        rare CROTAn card is present.
*     1996 February 8 (MJC):
*        Added checks not to propagate the FITSIO banner and Starlink
*        ORIGIN card in the NDF's FITS extension to the output FITS
*        file.
*     1996 November 22 (PWD):
*        Converted to provide GAIA/RTD NDF import.
*     1998 May 15 (PWD):
*        Added NDF WCS support (moved here to make sure NDF WCS is seen
*        before any that are present in the FITS headers).
*     2000 Nov 23 (PWD):
*        Changed to only add the Starlink ORIGIN header, if an existing
*        FITS header block doesn't have an ORIGIN card. Previously
*        always overwrote with Starlink header.
*     2000 Dec 08 (PWD):
*        Now adds default NDF WCS if no actual NDF WCS component
*        exists. The FITS headers still override this by precedence in the
*        header list. Removed axis encoding, this is passed with the NDF
*        WCS.
*     2001 Apr 26 (PWD):
*        LBOUND cards are no longer imported from the existing header
*        (these are written as part of the standard headers). Removed
*        HDUCLAS cards are these are not needed and can cause problems
*        with saved images that are converted to FITS.
*     2004 Sep 02 (PWD):
*        Converted to use CNF_PVAL for pointers.
