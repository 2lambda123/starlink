      SUBROUTINE RTD1_STINT( IORD )
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C   RTD1_STINT computes certain quantities which are needed by RTD1_EVERT
C      when it computes the actual weights for an interpolation. The
C      result produced by RTD1_STINT is in the BCOEF array in the COMMON
C      block, and is based on binomial coefficients computed by RTD1_BINOM.
C      From the Everett interpolation package originally coded by
C      Larry Goad at KPNO.  This version has been lifted almost unchanged
C      from the AIPS package - the only change has been that the include
C      files are now explicitly included in the program body.
C  INPUT:
C      IORD    I*2  The order of the interpolation, 0 = linear,
C                   1 = cubic, 2 = quintic, 3 = septic.

C  Modified by P.W. Draper, 25 November 1997. Was the FIGARO routine
C     INITEI. Renamed and calls & common blocks modified to RTD1_
C     namespace.
