      SUBROUTINE RTD1_ENWCS( IWCS, IPHEAD, NHEAD, AVAIL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     RTD1_ENWCS

*  Purpose:
*     Encodes an NDF WCS component as FITS headers.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RTD1_ENWCS( IWCS, IPHEAD, NHEAD, AVAIL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine encodes an NDF WCS component as FITS headers. A
*     native encoding is used so that a lossless recovery can be made
*     and so the system has natural precendence over other systems.

*  Arguments:
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        AST identifier to the FrameSet that is to be encoded.
*     IPHEAD = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to a character array that contains some FITS
*        headers and that will contain any new headers added here.
*     NHEAD = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        On exit this is the number of cards used in HEADER. On entry
*        the current number already used.
*     AVAIL = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The number of cards allocated by IPHEAD.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
