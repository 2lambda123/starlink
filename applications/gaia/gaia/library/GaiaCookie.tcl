#  Name:
#     GaiaCookie.tcl

#  Purpose:
#     Class for keeping track of a magic number.

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Description:
#     An instance of this class writes a file in the user's home directory
#     containing a randomly-generated value.  Certain sensitive 
#     operations (e.g. execution of arbitrary Tcl code) may require
#     presentation of this value to operate.  This effectively restricts
#     use of such operations to agents which can read the file.
#
#     Since it only makes sense to have a single cookie for the whole
#     application, this is a singleton class.  Use the get_instance
#     class proc to obtain the singleton instance.

#  Invocation:
#     set cookie gaia::GaiaCookie::get_instance

   #  -------------------

   #  Name of the file in the user's home directory used for writing the
   #  cookie.

   #  Whether to overwrite an existing cookie file if one is unexpectedly
   #  found.

   #  The content of the cookie itself.

   #  Common variables.
   #  -----------------

   #  The sole instance of this class.
