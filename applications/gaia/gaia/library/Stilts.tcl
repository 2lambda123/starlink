#  Name:
#     Stilts

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Invokes STILTS command to do things with tables.

#  Description:
#     Provides methods for invoking the external STILTS script.
#     It is assumed to be present in $::env(STILTS_DIR).
#
#     Note not currently used. Kept for reference and possible
#     future utility.

#  Configuration options:
#
#        -debug
#
#     Boolean flag which controls whether the "-debug" flag is to be
#     applied when STILTS is executed.  See SUN/256.
#
#        -verbose
#
#     Boolean flag which controls whether the "-verbose" flag is to be
#     applied when STILTS is executed.  See SUN/256.
