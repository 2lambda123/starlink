#  Name:
#     GaiaPolDisp

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tk] class

#  Purpose:
#     Implements a tool for displaying polarimetry data as graphical
#     vectors.

#  Description:
#     This class handles the visualisation of polarimetry data by drawing
#     vectors on the canvas. It handles the drawing of the vectors, the key, 
#     the selection of vectors using the mouse, and the highlighting of vectors.
#    
#  Invocations:
#
#        GaiaPolDisp object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a GaiaPolDisp object. The returned value
#     is the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this widget.

#  Configuration options:
#     See the "itk_option define" declarations below.
