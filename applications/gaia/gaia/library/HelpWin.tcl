# Allan Brighton  18 Mar 98  Copied from GAIA (Peter Draper, Starlink)
#                            and renamed to util::HelpWin.
#                            Modified comment format a little for use
#                            with the itcldoc script to generate
#                            man pages.
# Peter W. Draper 01 May 01  Reclaimed to use a hypertext help system.

# This is a simple class that displays the contents of a named html
# file. The file should be set as a configuration option when an
# instance is created. This class shares a window amongst all its
# instances, this means that it overwrites any previous contents.
