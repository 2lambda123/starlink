		  The aperture photometry toolboxes
		  =================================

   How to use this window to:
   --------------------------

   --- To measure a star now:

   1) Press the "Define object aperture" button.

   2) Place your cursor on the image over the star.

   3) Press down and hold down button 1.

   4) Move the mouse sideways until the circle contains all the star.

   5) Release the mouse button.

   6) Press the "Calculate results" button.

   7) Inspect the "Object details" and view the stars instrumental
      magnitude, or mean count.


In this example the sky background is estimated using the region
between the outer and inner annuli. If this region contains any
contamination then you will need to create sky apertures.


   --- Measure several stars:

You can create as many apertures as you like by repeating the stages
described above. All apertures are re-measured each time the "Calculate
results" button is pressed.


   --- Make measurements without an annulus:

Open the menu "Options" and select the "Use annular sky regions"
item. This now switches off the creation of the annulus region (note
this can also toggle the current aperture). Now create an object
aperture and then press the "Define sky aperture" button to create sky
apertures. These sky regions are just associated with this aperture
(note the colour change in sky aperture associated with an object
aperture).


   --- Resize/move an aperture:

To move or resize an aperture you first need to "select" it. Selecting
is done by placing your mouse cursor over the aperture and then
pressing button 1. This should change the aperture colour and
one or two little boxes will appear on the locus. These little boxes
are known as grips. 

To move the aperture just drag the aperture by pressing down and
holding down button 1 over the aperture and then moving the
mouse. The aperture will follow.

To resize the aperture drag a grip or use the sliders and entry
windows ("Semimajor axis:", "Eccentricity:", "Position angle:",
"Annulus inner scale:" and "Annulus outer scale:"). Note the sliders
and entry windows only work on the selected aperture. To activate a
value you type into a entry window press the <Return> key.


   --- Make all apertures the same size:

To create apertures with a fixed size, or which are constrained to be
the same size, choose the "Options" menu and select the "Keep
apertures same size" option. Apertures will now be created with the
values shown in the "Semimajor axis:", "Eccentricity:", "Position
angle:", "Annulus inner scale:" and "Annulus outer scale:" windows.

If you select one of these apertures and resize (or reorient) it, in
some way, then all the other apertures will track these changes.


   --- Resize more than one aperture at time:

To do this you must select all the apertures you want to modify
together. To do this select an aperture, then hold down the <Control>
button and select the next aperture etc. You can now say change all
the apertures to the same radius by typing a value into the "Semimajor
axis:" entry window and then pressing return. You can also get the
same effect by moving the slider.


   --- Use elliptical apertures:

Open the "Options" menu and select the "Use circular apertures"
item. Any new apertures that you now create will be elliptical. Use
the grips to reorient and resize the aperture.


   --- View all the measurements at once:

Just select "Results" tab and press "View all measurements". This
creates a new window that lists all the current apertures and their
related values. Double click on a line to make that aperture current.


   --- Save the measurements:

Just press the "Save" button. This will write all the current
measurements to a file "GaiaPhotomLog.Dat" by default. You can write
to a different file using the "Results" entry field.

The "Append" button appends the current measurements to the end of the 
results file (preceded by the name of the current image in a
comment). Note the "Save" option overwrites the results file without
prompting.


   --- Make the same measurements on other images:

To do this display your new image (either in a clone or by superseding
the existing image) and then open the "File" menu and select the "Read
measurements..." item. This allows you to select a file with your
existing measurements in. These apertures will now be redrawn. Press
"Calculate results" and then save the new measurements to a new file.

You can also use the results files together with the AUTOPHOTOM
program (see SUN/45) to redo the same measurements non-interactively.


   --- Change the frame zero point (magnitudes only):

Just type in the frame zero point into the entry window and press
return. All the existing apertures will now be re-measured.


   --- Set the image exposure time:

The easiest way to set the exposure time (so you can normalize all
your observations) is to just enter the exposure time in seconds in
the "Exposure time/qualifier:" entry, (found under the "Parameters"
tab) after making sure that the "Exposure time source:" menu is set to
"simple constant".

Note that the exposure time is just used as a ratio to scale the
intensities, so using seconds is only a convenience.

If your data have their exposure time set in the image headers
(e.g. FITS-like headers), then you can use this instead. Just select
"FITS keyword" and enter the header item name in the "Exposure
time/qualifier" entry.


   --- Control the centroiding, noise characteristics, sky estimators...:

The aperture photometry is actually performed by the PHOTOM program
AUTOPHOTOM. This is described in SUN/45. All the additional parameters
that define the conversion factor from data units to photons, any bias
in the data and modify the way that the sky background is estimated
can be set by selecting the "Parameters" tab. You should read SUN/45
(showme sun45) to understand these parameters.

WARNING: the error estimates in the measurements will be wrong unless
you set the image bias and data units to photons conversion factor
correctly.


   --- Understand the results for an aperture:

The results shown for an aperture have the following meanings:

   Aperture index:  just a sequence number to distinguish measurements

   X position:      before a making a measurement, the position of the 
   Y position:      center of the aperture, after making the
                    measurement, the centroided position -- if you've
                    selected centroiding

   Magnitude:       the magnitude of the object, this is sky
                    subtracted and scaled using the photons per data
                    unit and exposure factors

   Magnitude error: error in the magnitude, the error is derived using 
                    either the sky variance, photon statistics, or the
                    data variance, if you are using photon statistics
                    then a good knowledge of the bias level and
                    photons per data unit are required

   Sky value:       the estimated sky, either derived from the
                    annulus, or detached sky regions, or a constant,
                    scaled by photons per data unit factor
      

   Sum in aperture: sum of object data counts in aperture, scaled 
                    by the photon per data unit value and the exposure 
                    factors
       
   Error code:      status of measurement:
                    
                       OK measurement has no problems
                       B  one or more pixels in aperture is bad 
                       S  one or more pixels in aperture is saturated
                       E  the object aperture intersects the edge of 
                          the data array
                       ?  there are other problems with the measurement
