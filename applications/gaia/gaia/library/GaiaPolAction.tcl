#  Name:
#     GaiaPolAction

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tk] class

#  Purpose:
#     A GaiaPolAction which describes an undo-able action.

#  Description:
#     This class implements a type of GaiaPolObject which contains a 
#     description of an action which can be un-done or re-done, typically 
#     using the "Undo" and "Redo" items in the Edit menu.
#    
#  Invocations:
#
#        GaiaPolAction object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a GaiaPolAction object. The returned value
#     is the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this widget.

#  Configuration options:
#     See the "itk_option define" declarations below.

#  Methods:
#     Public:
#        getType{}: Return the action type
#        getDesc{}: Return the action description.

#  Inheritance:
#     ::gaia::GaiaPolObject

#  Inheritances:
#  =============
   inherit gaia::GaiaPolObject

#  Constructor:
#  ============
#  "$type" is a string which GaiaPolarimetry uses to identify the class of
#  action. "$desc" is a human readable description of the action. "$obj"
#  is a reference to an object associated with the action. "$ucmd" is a
#  string describing a method to be invoked on $obj (with any required
#  arguments) which will undo the action and "$rcmd" is a method to be 
#  invoked on $obj which will redo the action. $obj, $ucmd and $rcmd are 
#  usually only used if $type is "object".
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   constructor {type desc {obj ""} {ucmd "" } {rcmd "" } } {

#  Now initialize the class data. If this constructor has been invoked 
#  to construct the base class part of some super class, do not 
#  initialize the data since this will be done as a consequence of 
#  initializeing the super class data.
