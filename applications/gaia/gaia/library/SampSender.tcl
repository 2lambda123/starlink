#  Name:
#     SampSender

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Provides functionality for sending SAMP messages.

#  Description:
#     This class contains methods which use a supplied SampClient object
#     to send GAIA-specific client-level messages to one or all
#     of the other registered SAMP clients.
#
#     The send methods here feature a recipient_id argument; if this is
#     supplied it is the SAMP client-id of the intended recipient.
#     If it is blank, the send is a broadcast to all subscribed clients.

#  Configuration options:
#
#     samp_client
#        The SampClient object which handles hub communication.
#        This object will not function unless it has an active SampClient.
