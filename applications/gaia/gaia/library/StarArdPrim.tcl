#  Name:
#     StarArdPrim

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Provides a base class for implementing common ARD region related
#     operations and for storing ARD related information.

#  Description:
#     This class provides methods and public variables for performing
#     common ARD operations and for storing ARD information that is
#     not directly related to the representation of the region
#     (c.f. the region binary and unary operators).

#  Invocations:
#
#        StarArdPrim object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a StarArdPrim object. The return is
#     the name of the object. This class should not normally be
#     directly accessed in this way.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Configuration options:
#     binary_operator value
#       This configuation option stores the binary operator associated
#       with the current region. Note this can be set by the
#       check_description method.
#
#     unary_operator value
#        This configuration option stores the unary operator
#        associated with the current region. This should only be set to
#        .NOT. or "". A minus sign is recognised as .NOT.. Note this
#        can be set by the check_description method.

#  Methods:
#     check_description region_name desc
#        Checks that a description is a valid one for the type of ARD
#        region given. The return is true or false. The result of this
#        operation is to set the values of the public operators and to
#        set the protected variable "qualifiers_" to the values
#        following the keyword (without the parenthesis and commas).
#
#     show_properties top-level
#
#        Creates a top-level widget for containing widgets that
#        describe the properties of the ARD region and also allow them
#        to be changed

#  Notes:
#     unary operators disabled as not used yet.

#  Inheritance:
#     This widget inherits StarCanvasObject.
