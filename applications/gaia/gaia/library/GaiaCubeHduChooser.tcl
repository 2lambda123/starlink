#  Name:
#     GaiaCubeHduChooser

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tk] class

#  Purpose:
#     Chooser for HDUs in FITS or HDS container files.

#  Description:
#     This class provides an interface for browsing all the extensions
#     available in a FITS MEF file or NDFs in an HDS container file. The
#     "HDUs" can currently only be opened if a cube or a table containing
#     a compressed cube (RICE encoded).
#
#     Note that this class isn't related to GaiaHduChooser, that only offers
#     Skycat functionality which requires support of an rtdimage, this class
#     is based on more direct access without any image bias.

#  Invocations:
#
#        GaiaCubeHduChooser object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a GaiaCubeHduChooser object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Configuration options:
#     See itk_option definitions below.

#  Methods:
#     See method definitions below.
