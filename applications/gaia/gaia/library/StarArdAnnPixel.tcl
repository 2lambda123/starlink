#  Name:
#     StarArdAnnPixel

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Defines a class of ARD Pixel with an annulus of the same shape.

#  Description:
#     This class creates an ARD canvas Pixel item and draws an
#     annulus at the given scale factor about it. The annulus is
#     updated with the ARD Pixel.

#  Invocations:
#
#        StarArdAnnPixel object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a StarArdAnnPixel object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Configuration options:
#
#        -scale factor
#
#     The factor by which the annulus is larger than the ordinary ARD
#     Pixel.

#  Configuration options:
#     See public variable defintions.

#  Methods:
#     See method definitions.

#  Inheritance:
#     This object inherits StarArdPixel.
