#  Name:
#     PlasticSender

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Provides functionality for sending PLASTIC messages.

#  Description:
#     This class contains methods which use a supplied PlasticApp object
#     to send GAIA-specific application-level messages to some or all
#     of the other registered PLASTIC applications.

#  Configuration options:
#
#     plastic_app
#        The PlasticApp object which handles hub communication.
#        This object will not function unless it has an active PlasticApp.
