#  Name:
#     GaiaNDAccess

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Handles multidimensional dataset access in GAIA.

#  Description:
#     This class is designed to handle the access and description of datasets
#     that don't necessarily have 2 dimensions. Superficially it is datatype
#     independent, supporting access to NDF and FITS data, relying on the
#     ndf::, fits:: and array:: Tcl commands. Sections of the data can be
#     directly extracted from cubes for passing into GAIA/Skycat for display
#     as images and spectra.

#  Invocations:
#
#        GaiaNDAccess object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a GaiaNDAccess object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Configuration options:
#     See below.

#  Methods:
#     See below.

#  Inheritance:
#     This object inherits no other classes.
