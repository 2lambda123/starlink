			      Contouring
			      ==========

   How to use this window to:
   --------------------------

   --- Contour the displayed image.

   1) Press the "Generate" tab.

   2) Press the "Generate" button.

   3) Press the "Draw Contours" button.

This generates some automatic levels and performs the contouring. The
levels actually used are shown in the "Level" entries. To change these 
values just edit the entries and press <Return> or the "Draw Contours" 
button (pressing <Return in the entry field just redraws that
contour).


   --- Contour another image over the displayed image.

Either display the other image in another window and select it from
the "Displayed image:" menu, or enter the name of the image file into
the "Other image:" field. Now enter some appropriate contour levels
and press "Draw Contours".

NOTE: images entered in the "Other image:" field always override
displayed images. Clear this field to use a displayed image.

If the images both have sky coordinates then this system will be used
for alignment, otherwise the images will be assumed to have the same
pixel coordinates. If you are using sky coordinates which cover large
areas of sky or your images are not axes aligned then you may need to
choose the "Options" menu and select the "Draw contours using
geodesics" item, you may also need to select the "Region" tab and
choose "Whole of image" for the contour region.


   ---  Print the image plus contours.

Choose the "File" menu in the main window and select "Print...". This
should create a new dialog window. Just choose the appropriate
options.


   ---  Save and restore the contour levels etc. to redraw at a later time.

Choose the "File" menu and select the "Save configuration..."
item. When the file selection dialog appears choose a filename.

To reload a configuration choose the "Read configuration..." item.


   ---  Set the line thickness or colour.

Each contour has its own thickness and colour. The menu associated
with each level show the possible values, just select the one you
want. Note these options are applied immediately, there is no need to
redraw the contours.


   ---  Generate contours at magnitude-like intervals.

Press the "Generate" tab, select the "Algorithm" menu and choose the
"magnitude" item. Now enter the value of a reference point on your
image and an increment in magnitudes. Finally press the "Generate"
button. 

I use this option by entering a value somewhat above the sky
background and then setting the interval to say -0.5 (negative to get
increasing data values). The formulae used is:

                                     (-0.4 * i * step_value)
   contour_level_i = start_value * 10

For i = 0 up to number of contours required.


   ---  Contour the region right to the edge of the display.

Select the "Region" tab and press the "Whole of image:" button, or
alternatively increase the X and Y display fractions.

NOTE: it is much quicker to contour part of an image, this also uses
less memory.


   ---  Add units to the contour key.

Press the "Key" tab. This provides a range of options for changing the 
key title, key position, colour etc. Note that the key setup is saved
as part of the configuration, so can be restored.


   ---  Move/remove the key.

To move the key just place your pointer over it, press mouse button 1
and hold it down, now move the pointer and the key will follow. 

To remove the key select the "Key" tab and toggle the "Display key:"
button.


   ---  Add contours from more than one other image. 

To do this you need to create a new contour toolbox. Just select the
"File" menu and choose the "New window" item.


   ---  Draw axes around the contours.

To do this you use the axis grid toolbox. Just select the
"Image-Analysis" menu in the main window and choose the "Overlay axes
grid" item. To match the regions drawn choose the "Scaling" tab and
select the "Whole of image:" button, now make the display fractions
the same size as used in the contour toolbox.
