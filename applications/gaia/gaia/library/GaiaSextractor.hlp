                       Object detection window
                       =======================

   How to use this window to:
   --------------------------

   --- Detect the objects on my image:

Just press the "Detect objects" button. This will by default find all
the objects, create a catalogue of their positions, intensity and
shape parameters, display the catalogue and finally get the catalogue
window to draw some detection ellipses.

You can now use the catalogue window to investigate the results (see
the help there for making selections).


   --- Change the detection limits, etc. etc. etc.:

The parameters shown in the various "pages" of the toolbox, control
the values used in the detection and analysis of the objects on your
image. These are directly related to the parameters used by the
SExtractor program, the documentation (SUN/225) and associated
documentation (MUD/165) of which should be consulted for their exact
meaning.

Usually the meaning is obvious from the description in the short help
(displayed at the bottom of the window), so you can proceed, at least
initially, from just these.


   --- Configure the default parameters:

When the toolbox starts up it configures itself by reading files
called "default.sex" and "default.param". To locate these files it
searches the following directories:

   1) The current directory.
   2) The config/ directory of the SExtractor program installation.
   3) The directory of the SExtractor program.

If they are not found then built-in defaults are used. So you may
configure the default setup by changing these two files and placing
them in the current directory. Note, however, that the interface
itself will update these two files (unless you've changed the names to
be used) whenever a detection pass is made, so they always reflect the
current state of the interface.


   --- Run SExtractor using the values in the toolbox:

When it runs the toolbox updates the "default.sex" and "default.param"
files (unless you've changed in names used). These can then be used to
run SExtractor. You can also use the File menu items to save the
program and catalogue parameters to other files. So you can use the
GAIA interface to fine tune the detection parameters for an image and
then use these to do the detections on other images.


   --- Make detections on one image and measurements on another:

The toolbox always makes its measurements on the displayed image. If
you want to use another image to do the initial detections then just
enter its name in the "Detection image:" entry field.


   --- Stop plotting detection ellipses:

If you want to stop plotting detection ellipses, then look under the
"Options" menu and de-select the currently highlighted option.


   --- Get hardcopy:

To get a hardcopy of your image plus detections use the "Print..."
item under the "File" menu in the main image window. Remember you only
get a copy of what is visible, so if you have a large image unzoom it
until it is all visible.

If you want to draw axes around your image then see the "Overlay axes
grid..." item under the "Image-Analysis" menu in the main window.


   --- Use my own version of SExtractor:

To use your own version of SExtractor you need to define the
environment variable EXTRACTOR_DIR to point to the directory that
contains your "sex" program. Note this directory, or a sub-directory
of it called "config" should contain the SExtractor configurations
files.

The toolbox was developed using a Starlink modified SExtractor 
version 2.1.6. Later versions may not be supported.


   --- Use the Starlink version of SExtractor on my FITS image:

By default the toolbox will use the native version of SExtractor on
FITS files. To stop this just open the "Options" menu and de-select the
"Use Native SExtractor" item. You may need to do this if you have an
image with a DSS astrometric solution and you want to measure sky
coordinates.


   --- View my stars/galaxies separated:

To view your catalogue using a cut in the star/galaxy measurement you
need to use the catalogue window controls. 

One way to do this is to sort by the "CLASS_STAR" column and just drag
out all the objects you want to see (these will then be highlighted in
the main window). The other way to do this is to copy the catalogue
and open it twice in local catalogue windows. You can then use the
catalogue window methods for selecting a rows with values between
given ranges (see the help in the catalogue window for how to do
this).


   --- Change the output catalogue file extension:

The file types output by the toolbox are restricted to the following:

  - .FIT, for FITS-tables (SExtractor FITS_1.0)

  - .ASC, for plain ASCII tables (SExtractor ASCII_HEAD)

  - .TAB, for tab-tables, the "native" format.

All these can be restored by reading back as local catalogues.


   --- Read back a catalogue:

To read back a catalogue and display it as a series of detection
ellipses you need to use the "Read old catalogue..." item in the
"File" menu. 

You can also read back catalogues as using the "Data-Servers" - "Local
Catalogues" item on the main window. However it is unlikely that
you'll get suitable ellipses drawn. 


   --- Change the colour of the ellipses:

The "Options" - "Set Plot Symbols..." item in the catalogue window
creates a dialog window in which you can define many things about the
properties of any shapes that are drawn (these are Tcl expressions of
the column names). To change the colour just choose a new one and
apply it.
