#  Name:
#     StarAppFilter

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Creates a list of "filters" to process the currently displayed
#     image.

#  Description:
#     This class controls a series of Starlink applications that perform
#     simple pipe-line processing of an image (a filter). The filters
#     are defined in two files that exist in the GAIA main directory
#     and in the user's $HOME directory. Both files have the same name:
#     ".gaFilters". The format of the file is simple for the moment,
#     but is expected to increase in complexity as more functionality
#     is folded in.
#
#     The filters defined in these files are labelled in the "Filters"
#     menu created in any GAIA windows.

#   File format:
#     gaFilters must have the following format:
#
#        Filter replace_image filter_binary_name \
#           command_qualifier_string use_prefix  
#           output_image_name_modifier label
#
#     So for instance the KAPPA application BLOCK might be run
#     using:
#
#        Filter 1 $env{KAPPA_DIR}/block \
#           "in=$indata box=[10,10] out=$outdata accept" \
#           1 smooth_ "Smooth 10 by 10"
#
#      The symbol "$indata" will be replaced with the name of the
#      currently displayed image as suitable for passing to a Starlink
#      application. The variable "$outdata" will be constructed from
#      the displayed image name, but will be modified using the
#      "smooth_" as a prefix to the current image name (setting
#      use_prefix to 0 would result in a postfix).
#
#      The $env{KAPPA_DIR} variable is changed to the value of the
#      KAPPA_DIR environment variable.  
#
#      Since replace is set to 1 (true) the currently displayed image
#      will be erased and the output of this command will be displayed
#      instead. If replace had been 0 (false) then a new display would
#      have been created and the new image displayed in that.

#  Invocations:
#
#        StarAppFilter object_name gaia [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a StarAppFilter object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Configuration options:
#     See public variable defintions.

#  Methods:
#     See method definitions.

#  Inheritance:
#     This object inherits no other classes.
