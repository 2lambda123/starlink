#  Name:
#     gaiaMain

#  Purpose:
#     Main routine for GAIA image display and analysis tool.

#  Type of Module:
#     Tcl/Tk script.

#  Description:
#     This is the top-level routine for the GAIA display tool.  It
#     creates the initial window and performs global initialisations
#     (auto path etc.).

#  Invocation:
#     source gaiaMain.tcl

#  Notes:
#     This will only run with the skycat_wish installed as part
#     of the GAIA package.
