#  Name:
#     GaiaPolList

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tk] class

#  Purpose:
#     Implements an extendable list with a built-in iterator for storing
#     GaiaPolObjects.

#  Description:
#     This class implements an extendable list of GaiaPolObjects, in which
#     one entry is nominated as the current entry.
#
#  Invocations:
#
#        GaiaPolList object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a GaiaPolList object. The returned value
#     is the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this widget.

#  Configuration options:
#     See the "itk_option define" declarations below.

#  Methods:
#     Public:
#        last{}: Is the current entry the last entry?
#        first{}: Is the current entry the first entry?
#        next{}: Increments the index of the current entry if it is not
#                already at the last entry.
#        prev{}: Decrements the index of the current entry if it is not
#                already at the first entry.
#        get{}:  Returns a clone of the current entry GaiaPolObject, or a
#                blank string if the list is empty.
#        add{ GaiaPolObject }: Truncates the list at the current object,
#                and then appends a clone of the supplied GaiaPolObject
#                to the end of the list. The new entry becomes the current
#                entry.
#        getCurrent{}: Returns the index of the current entry, or -1 if
#                the list is empty.
#        reset{}: Empties the list.
#        setMax{max}: Set the max. no. of objects which can be stored in
#                the list. Once the list is full, adding a new object
#                causes te oldest object to be removed from the list.
#                A blank value (the default) implies no limit.
#        getMax{}: Returns the max. no. of objects allowed in the list.
#     Protected:
#        getStack{}: Returns a Tcl list containing the names of all the
#                GaiaPolObjects in the list, in the order in which they were
#                added.
