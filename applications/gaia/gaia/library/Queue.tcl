#  Name:
#     Queue

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Defines a class for implementing a queue of strings.

#  Description:
#     This class provides a basic queue mechanism for storing strings.

#  Invocations:
#
#        Queue object_name
#
#     This creates an instance of a Queue object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Methods:
#     
#     push string
#
#   Push a string onto the queue.
#
#     pop
#
#   Retrieve a string from the queue. If queue is empty this is
#   returned as "", which may not be added to the queue.
#
#     size
#
#   Returns the number of strings in the queue.

#  Inheritance:
#     This class inherits no other classes.
