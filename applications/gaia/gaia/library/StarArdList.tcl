#  Name:
#     StarArdList

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Controls a list of ARD objects.

#  Description:
#     This class controls a list of ARD objects displayed on a canvas.
#     It controls the creation of many objects from an ARD description
#     stored in a file (the format at this time must be simple and
#     just consist of REGION(parameter) statements). It also writes a
#     description of the current ARD regions to disk file.

#  Invocations:
#
#        StarArdList object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a StarArdList object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Configuration options:
#
#        -canvasdraw StarCanvasDraw_object
#
#     Name of the StarCanvasDraw object that is to be used to create
#     and control the graphical representations of the ARD regions.
#
#        -canvas canvas
#
#     Name of the canvas widget associated with the CanvasDraw object.
#
#        -rtdimage rtdimage
#
#     Name of the image widget displayed in the canvas (not the item
#     number the image identifier).
#
#        -notify_created_cmd command
#
#     Command to execute when an ARD region is created.

#  Methods:
#
#        createard description
#
#     Command to create an ARD region from a textual description. This
#     should be a complete description including the keyword,
#     qualifiers and possible operators as described in the ARD
#     documentation. Returns 0 if the description cannot be interpreted.
#
#        save_description ios
#
#     Writes an ARD description of the current list of objects to the
#     given input/output stream.
#
#        save_selected_description ios
#
#     Writes an ARD description of the currently selected objects to the
#     given input/output stream.
#
#        create_region type {resize 1} {desc ""}
#
#     Creates a region of the given type (Circle Box etc.) and either
#     allows it to be resized interactively (resize=1), or creates it
#     from an ARD description.
#
#        created_object index id
#
#     Private callback for object creation.
#
#        known_types newtypes
#
#     Set or query the ARD types known to the list.
#
#        deleted_object_ id
#
#     Private callback use when an object is interactively deleted.
#
#        bbox
#
#     Returns an approximate bounding box for the ARD regions in the list.
#
#        image_coord x y
#
#     Converts a canvas coordinate into an image coordinate.

#  Inheritance:
#     This class inherits no other classes.
