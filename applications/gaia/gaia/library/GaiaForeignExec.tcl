#  Name:
#     GaiaForeignExec

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Defines a class for running a "foreign" program in the
#     background.

#  Description:
#     This class defines a object that represents an foreign
#     application. It provides methods for controlling and monitoring
#     the activity of the application

#  Invocations:
#
#        GaiaForeignExec object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a GaiaForeignExec object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this widget.

#  Configuration options:
#
#        application full_path_name
#
#     This option sets the name of the application to be run. The name
#     should include the full path. This option must be set at
#     sometime before any methods to control the application are used.
#
#        show_output
#
#     If true then a scrolled listbox is created and any output from
#     the application is shown. If set to the name of a widget then
#     the output is directed into that (unless it no longer exists).

#  Methods:
#
#        status
#
#     Returns the current status of the application. If the
#     application name is undefined then this is "void...", otherwise
#     it is "running..." or "waiting...".
#
#        runwith args
#        runwiths qual
#
#     This runs the application, passing it the given args as program
#     parameters. You may add new run commands before the previous one
#     has completed. The runwiths form just accepts a single string
#     as argument (this can be useful when it is difficult to form a
#     well behaved list).
#
#        run_next_command_
#
#     Internal method used to run the next command in the queue.
#
#        delete_sometime
#
#     If invoked this method will cause the application to end when
#     the current commands are completed. This should always be used
#     in preference to the inbuilt "delete" command.
#
#        command_completed_
#
#     Private method that is invoked when a command is completed.
#
#        inform_
#
#     Internal method used to process any return messages from the
#     application as it runs.
#

#  Inheritance:
#     This widget inherits no other classes.
