#  Name:
#     GaiaHduChooser

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tk] class

#  Purpose:
#     Extends SkyCatHduChooser to add features required for GAIA.

#  Description:

#     This class extends SkyCatHduChooser so that GAIA specific features can
#     be added. At present this amounts to changing the way that FITS tables
#     are accessed, so that we can apply heuristics to catalogue configuration
#     (pick up RA and DEC columns, reconstruct the symbol etc). This is done
#     by using the GaiaConvertTable conversions (which also deal with CAT &
#     ASCII formats). We also intercept any binary tables that have
#     "COMPRESSED_IMAGE" in their EXTNAME and convert these into temporary
#     FITS image files. 
#
#     Later addition. Check for cubes and display them appropriately.

#  Invocations:
#
#        GaiaHduChooser object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a GaiaHduChooser object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Configuration options:
#     See itk_option definitions below.

#  Methods:
#     See method definitions below.
