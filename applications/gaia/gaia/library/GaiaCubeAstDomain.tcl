#  Name:
#     GaiaCubeAstDomain

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tk] class

#  Purpose:
#     Creates a toolbox for changing the domain (i.e. coordinate
#     system) displayed for a data cube.

#  Description:
#     This class creates a window that contains controls for changing
#     to one of the available AST domains in the cube WCS.

#  Invocations:
#
#        GaiaCubeAstDomain object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a GaiaCubeAstDomain object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Configuration options:
#    See itk_option define lines below.

#  Methods:
#     See method definitions below.

#  Inheritance:
#     gaia::GaiaAstDomain
