#  Name:
#     PlasticHub

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Provides methods for communicating with a running PLASTIC hub.

#  Description:
#     This class serves as a proxy for a remote PLASTIC hub process.
#     On construction it attempts to locate a plastic hub's XML-RPC
#     server by searching for and reading the ~/.plastic file.
#     When constructed, hub methods can be executed using the 
#     execute method.For instance, to determine the ID of the 
#     running hub, do:
#
#        plastic::PlasticHub hub
#        set hub_id [hub execute getHubId]
#     
#     See http://plastic.sourceforge.net/ for discussion of the PLASTIC
#     protocol.

   #  Methods:
   #  --------

   #  Executes one of the hub methods using XML-RPC on the remote hub.
   #  See the PLASTIC specification for the descriptions of these methods.

   #  Common Procedures:
   #  ------------------

   #  Returns 1 if a PLASTIC hub is apparently running, 0 if not.
   public proc is_hub_running {} {
      return [file exists [rendezvous_file]]
   }

   #  Returns the location of the .plastic file which contains information
   #  concerning a currently-running hub.
   public proc rendezvous_file {} {
      return $::env(HOME)/.plastic
   }

   #  Reads a java properties file into a given associative array.
   protected proc read_props_ {filename props} {
      upvar $props _props
      set fid [open $filename r]
      while {[gets $fid line] >= 0} {
         if {[regexp {^([A-Za-z0-9\.]+) *= *(.*)$} [string trim $line] \
                                                   all key value]} {
            set _props([unescape_ $key]) [unescape_ $value]
         }
      }
      close $fid
   }

   #  Unescapes a line from a java properties file.  The format is
   #  documented at 
   #  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.InputStream).
   protected proc unescape_ {in} {

      #  The 'algorithm' used here is not foolproof; however the main
      #  form of funny business likely to be encountered in the .plastic
      #  file is backslash quoting, which fortuitously can be handled
      #  pretty well by shoving it through an eval.  However \uNNNN-type
      #  unicode characters amongst other things would fox this routine.

   #  Private variables: (available to instance)
   #  ------------------
