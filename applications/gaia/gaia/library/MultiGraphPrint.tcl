#  Name:
#     MultiGraphPrint

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Print multiple BLT graphs in one pass.

#  Description:
#     This class define an object that will print the contents of a
#     series of BLT graphs widgets to either a printer or file.

#  Invocations:
#
#        MultiGraphPrint object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a MultiGraphPrint object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.
