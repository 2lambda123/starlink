 *  Name:
 *     VOTableWriteFunctions

 *  Purpose:
 *     Utility functions for converting a VOTable into a tab table.

 *  Description:
 *     These functions make use of the codesynthesis classes generated using
 *     the VOTable 1.1 schema to read a VOTable and write it out as a
 *     tab table.
 *
 *     There are two fundamental versions of theses schema derived classes
 *     (sadly not derived from each other, so no common interface, which is
 *     why these functions are preprocessed using differing C++ namespaces)
 *     one fully namespace qualified, the official schema, and one where all
 *     the elements are in the default namespace (it happens, in fact may
 *     be standard).
 *
 *     (Note in passing: some of this could be done using templates, but that
 *     looks untidy as you cannot use a namespace as a template, just types,
 *     so each type used would need to be declared, that's NS::VOTABLE,
 *     NS::TABLE, NS::PARAM etc., see emptyTable for a starter if you prefer
 *     that approach).

 *  Language:
 *     C++.
