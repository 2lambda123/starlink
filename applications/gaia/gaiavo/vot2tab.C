 *  Name:
 *     vot2tab

 *  Purpose:
 *     Converts a "VOTable" into a "tab table".

 *  Language:
 *     C++

 *  Type of Module:
 *     Standalone program

 *  Description:
 *     This program extracts a TABLE stored in a VOTable and converts it into
 *     "tab table" format for use in Skycat and GAIA. VOTables are an XML
 *     document which can contain many tables (and the associated meta-data),
 *     so the actual table to extract is identified using a number, zero being
 *     the first table.

 *  Usage:
 *     vot2tab in ntab out

 *  Parameters:
 *     in = string 
 *        Filename of the VOTable.
 *     ntab = integer
 *        Index of the table to extract from the VOTable. Starts from 
 *        0.
 *     out = string
 *        Filename for the extracted table in "tab table" format.

 *  Implementation Deficiencies:
 *     - The transformation process doesn't record all the information
 *       available in the input catalogue.
