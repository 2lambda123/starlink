                    <TD>2MASS data were collected by uniformly scanning the entire sky in three near-infrared bands to detect and characterize point sources brighter than about 1 mJy in each band, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 10, using a pixel size of 2.0". This achieves an 80,000-fold improvement in sensitivity relative to earlier surveys. 2MASS used two new, highly-automated 1.3-m telescopes, one at Mt. Hopkins, AZ, and one at CTIO, Chile. Each telescope is equipped with a three-channel camera, each channel consisting of a 256 by 256 array of HgCdTe detectors, capable of observing the sky simultaneously at J (1.25 microns), H (1.65 microns), and K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (2.17 microns). &lt;p&gt;2MASS images and other data products can be obtained at the &lt;a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/2MASS/QL/"&gt;NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive&lt;/a&gt;</TD>

                    <TD>Cosmic Background Explorer DIRBE</TD>
                    <TD>&lt;P&gt; The DIRBE Project Data Sets cover the whole sky and provide photometric data in 10 bands ranging in wavelength from 1.25 to 240 microns. SkyView currently provides three maps: an early averaged map including including zodiacal and Galactic components (COBE DIRBE (OLD)), a more recent cleaner version of that data (COBE DIRBE/AAM) and a map with the zodaical light subtracted out (COBE DIRBE/ZSMA). We do not recommend use of the first map, but it is retained for compability with earlier investigations. &lt;P&gt; Detailed descriptions of the DIRBE, the data processing, and the data products are given in an Explanatory Supplement. A Small Source Spectral Energy Distribution Browser can be used to assess the visibility of an unresolved or small extended source in the DIRBE data and see its spectral energy distribution. As noted in section 5.6.6 of the Explanatory Supplement, the DIRBE Time-ordered Data are required to derive definitive point source fluxes. &lt;p&gt; These maps provide an estimate of the infrared intensity at each pixel and wavelength band based on an interpolation of the observations made at various times at solar elongations close to 90°. &lt;P&gt; These COBE DIRBE maps are a combination original ten band passes with the following wavelengths: &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Band 1 - 1.25 µm &lt;LI&gt;Band 2 - 2.2 µm &lt;LI&gt;Band 3 - 3.5 µm &lt;LI&gt;Band 4 - 4.9 µm &lt;LI&gt;Band 5 - 12 µm &lt;LI&gt;Band 6 - 25 µm &lt;li&gt;Band 7 - 60 µm &lt;li&gt;Band 8 - 100 µm &lt;li&gt;Band 9 - 140 µm &lt;li&gt;Band 10 - 240 µm &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; The default two dimensional array uses Band 8 (100 µm). &lt;P&gt; The COBE DIRBE/Annual Average Maps (AAM) is the cumulative weighted average of the photometry. This average is calculated using the weighted number of observations from each Weekly Averaged Map ( WtNumObs from the Weekly Averaged Map) as the weight, such that annual_average =sum( weekly_average * weekly_weight )/ sum( weekly_weight ) &lt;p&gt; COBE DIRBE/Zodi-Subtracted Mission Average (ZSMA) Skymap represents the extra-Solar system sky brightness. It is the average residual map that results after the modelled interplanetary dust (IPD) signal is subtracted from each of the DIRBE Weekly Skymaps from the cryogenic mission. Individual weekly residual maps can be reconstructed from the data supplied in the DIRBE Sky and Zodi Atlas (DSZA).</TD>

Compass is available at the &lt;a href="http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/cossc.html"&gt; Compton Observatory Science Support Center &lt;/a&gt;. &lt;P&gt; The maps were originally generated by the CompTel Instrument Team as three separate maps in the bands: &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;1-3 MeV &lt;LI&gt;3-10 MeV &lt;LI&gt;10-30 MeV &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;P&gt; All CompTel observations from phases 1, 2 and 3 were included in the maps (May 1991 through October 1994). These maps were combined into a single 3-D map at &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt; &lt;P&gt;</TD>

                    <TD>&lt;A NAME=CO&gt; CO&lt;/A&gt; &lt;P&gt; New large-scale CO surveys of the first and second Galactic quadrants and the nearby molecular cloud complexes in Orion and Taurus, obtained with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 1.2 m telescope, have been combined with 31 other surveys obtained over the past two decades with that instrument and a similar telescope on Cerro Tololo in Chile, to produce a new composite CO survey of the entire Milky Way. The survey consists of 488,000 spectra that Nyquist or beamwidth (1/8 deg) sample the entire Galactic plane over a strip 4 deg-10 deg wide in latitude, and beamwidth or 1/4 deg sample nearly all large local clouds at higher latitudes. Compared with the previous composite CO survey of Dame et al. (1987), the new survey has 16 times more spectra, up to 3.4 times higher angular resolution, and up to 10 times higher sensitivity per unit solid angle. &lt;P&gt; Users should be aware that both the angular resolution and the sensitivity varies from region to region in the velocity-integrated map. The component surveys were integrated individually using clipping or moment masking in order to display nearly all statistically significant emission but little noise above a level of ~1.5 K km/s. See the reference below and the &lt;a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/mmw/MilkyWayinMolClouds.html" &gt; Millimeter-Wave Group site&lt;/a&gt; for more details</TD>

                    <TD>This survey comprises the compressed digitization of the Southern Sky Survey and the Palomar Sky Survey E plates as distributed on CD ROM by the Space Telescope Science Institute. Coverage of the entire sky is included. This survey consists of the digititized Southern Sky Survey conducted at the UK Southern Schmidt Survey Group by the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh (prior to 1988) and the Anglo-Australian Observatory (since 1988) Additional plates covering regions with bright objects are also included. The plates were digitized at the Space Telescope Science Institute and compressed using algorithms developed by R.White. These data are distributed on a set of 101 CD-ROMs. &lt;P&gt; The following data are included: &lt;DL&gt; &lt;DT&gt;Southern hemisphere &lt;DD&gt; SERC Southern Sky Survey and the SERC J Equatorial extension. These are typically deep, 3600s, IIIa-J exposures with a GG395 filter. Also included are 94 short (1200s) V exposures typically at Galactic latitudes below 15°. Special exposures are included in the regions of the Magellenic clouds. &lt;DT&gt;Northern hemisphere &lt;dd&gt; The northern hemisphere is covered by 644 plates from the POSS E survey. A special exposure of the M31 region that is distributed on the CD ROMs is not used in &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/DL&gt; &lt;p&gt; Note that &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt; currently assumes that plates from positive declinations are from the POSS survey and plates from the south are from the Southern Sky Survey. It constructs FITS headers based on these assumptions on all images even if they may be derived from one of the exceptional regions. In regions of overlap, &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt; uses the nearest image. In some regions where the overlap between the northern and southern sky surveys is more than 6°, some of the northern plates have been removed from &lt;i&gt; SkyView&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;p&gt; The Space Telescope Science Institute (AURA Inc) holds a copyright to these scanned data The original survey data is copyright ROE, the UK-PPARC (Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, the successor to the Science and Engineering Research Council), the AAO, CalTech and the National Geographic Society. &lt;P&gt; 2019.&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</TD>

                    <TD>&lt;A NAME=DSS2&gt;Second Generation Digitized Sky Survey&lt;/A&gt; This survey includes high-resolution all sky optical images in two colors. This survey is not local to &lt;i&gt;SkyView&lt;/i&gt;, it is served remotely from the &lt;a href=http://www-gsss.stsci.edu&gt; ST ScI &lt;/a&gt;. Processing of the survey is ongoing. The current state is of each of the elements is described in the &lt;a href=http://www-gsss.stsci.edu/PlateMaterial/plateMaterial.htm#DSSIIPlates&gt; plate status table &lt;/a&gt; at the ST ScI. &lt;P&gt; Data are retrieved from the ST ScI site in 18' tiles that are cached at the &lt;I&gt;SkyView&lt;/i&gt; server. Thus users may note that when multiple images are retrieved from near the same region, the first request takes substantially longer. &lt;p&gt; The native projection of these data is described as a high-order polynomial distortion of a gnomonic projection using the same terms as the DSS This is not one of the standard projections offered as an output by&lt;i&gt; SkyView&lt;/i&gt;.</TD>

                    <TD>&lt;P&gt; These data are from the Compton GRO EGRET team. Data are from all pointings of the EGRET instrument in the verification phase and phase 1-4 of the Compton mission. The maps exist in energies 30-100 MeV, 100-100000 MeV, and as a multi-dimensional, 10 channel survey. For the multi-dimensional survey, channels 1-3 comprise energies less than 100 MeV, and channels 4-10 comprise energies greater than 100 MeV. Note that the energies are not uniformly split among the channels. &lt;P&gt; The EGRET 3D map is comprised of ten channels with the following energy ranges: &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Channel 1 30-50 MeV &lt;LI&gt;Channel 2 50-70 MeV &lt;LI&gt;Channel 3 70-100 MeV &lt;LI&gt;Channel 4 100-150 MeV &lt;LI&gt;Channel 5 150-300 MeV &lt;LI&gt;Channel 6 300-500 MeV &lt;LI&gt;Channel 7 500-1000 MeV &lt;LI&gt;Channel 8 1000-2000 MeV &lt;LI&gt;Channel 9 2000-4000 MeV &lt;LI&gt;Channel 10 4000-10000 MeV &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; The default two dimensional image for the EGRET 3D survey is an average of Channels 4 - 10 (energies greater than 100 MeV).</TD>

                    <TD>The VLA FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters) is a project designed to produce the radio equivalent of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey over 10,000 square degrees of the North Galactic Cap. The &lt;a href="http://sundog.stsci.edu/top.html"&gt; FIRST home page &lt;/a&gt; has details of the instrumentation, status of the project, and data available. Currently (January 1997) about 5000 images of approximately .775x.58 degrees are available. &lt;P&gt; These FIRST data have been retrieved from the &lt;a href="ftp://archive.stsci.edu/pub/vla_first/data/"&gt; FIRST FTP archive &lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources"&gt; Space Telescope Science Institute&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;p&gt; The FIRST survey is included on the &lt;b&gt;SkyView High Resolution Radio Coverage &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="/images/high_res_radio.jpg"&gt; map&lt;/a&gt;.

                    <TD>GRANAT/SIGMA</TD>
                    <TD>The Soviet orbital observatory GRANAT was launched in December 1989 and was operational till November 1998. One of the main instruments of the observatory was the French-Soviet hard X-ray coded mask telescope SIGMA (Paul et al.1 1991, Adv.Space Res., 11, 279). It was the first space telescope that used coded aperture technique for reconstruction of sky images in hard X-rays (35-1300 keV). The angular resolution of the telescope was approximately 12' and the accuracy of a source localization is approximately 2-3'.&lt;p&gt; SIGMA discovered numerious interesting hard X-ray sources including GRS 1758-258, which is located only 40' from bright soft X-ray source GX 5-1. It detected hard X-ray flux from X-ray burster A1742-294, which is very near to bright black hole binary 1E1740.7-2942. SIGMA set an upper limit on the hard X-ray flux of from the central supermassive black hole in our Galaxy.&lt;p&gt; During the period 1990-1998 SIGMA observed more that one quarter of the sky with sensitivity better than 100 mCrab. The Galactic Center region had the deepest exposure ( approximately 9 million sec), with the sensitivity to a source discovery (S/N &gt; ~ 5) or approximately 10 mCrab.&lt;p&gt; A list of all detected sources with references to publications on them is presented in the paper of Revnivtsev et al. 2004, Astr. Lett. v.6. In these survey images (40-100 keV) all performed observations are averaged together. Transient sources that were discovered by SIGMA may not visible in the averaged image. &lt;p&gt; This survey has some features that users should keep in mind. The SIGMA telescope is a complicated instrument and is strongly dominated by the accuracy of the background subtraction. The presence of a very bright source in the field of view of the telescope sometimes can not be fully accounted for and as a result of it some 'ghost' sources can appear. Such features can be seen in the regions near very bright sources like Crab Nebula, Cyg X-1, Nova Per 1992, Nova Mus 1991, Nova Oph 1993, and in the Galactic Center region. In addition to its nominal field of view (~17x17 deg) located around the optical axis of the telescope, SIGMA had another window of relatively high transparency of its shield, approximately 20-30° apart from the optical axis. Becuase of this a very bright sources like Cyg X-1 can cause non zero illumination of the SIGMA detector if they are located approximately 20-30° from the optical axis. The ring-like features caused by this effect, can be seen around Cyg X-1, and Nova Per 1992. &lt;p&gt; The count rate of detected sources (or upper limits) can be roughly translated into mCrab using the fact that that Crab nebula gives the count rate approximately 2.8e&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; cnts/s in the units, provided in 'flux' maps</TD>

                    <TD>H-alpha Full Sky Map</TD>
                    <TD>The full-sky H-alpha map (6' FWHM resolution) is a composite of the Virginia Tech Spectral line Survey (VTSS) in the north and the Southern H-Alpha Sky Survey Atlas (SHASSA) in the south. Stellar artifacts and bleed trails have been carefully removed from these maps. The Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) survey provides a stable zero-point over 3/4 of the sky on a one degree scale. This composite map can be used to provide limits on thermal bremsstrahlung (free-free emission) from ionized gas known to contaminate microwave-background data. The map (in Rayleighs; 1R=10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;/4pi photons/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s/sr), an error map, and a bitmask are provided in 8640x4320 Cartesian projections as well as HEALPIX (Nside 256, 512, and 1024) projections on the &lt;a href="http://astro.princeton.edu/~dfink/halpha/"&gt; H-Alpha Full-Sky Map web site&lt;/a&gt;.</TD>

                    <TD>HEAO 1A</TD>
                    <TD>The HEAO-1 spacecraft was launched into low earth orbit on 12 August, 1977. Its orbit was very nearly circular with an apogee of 445 km, inclination of 22.75°, and orbital period of 93 minutes. During the bulk of the mission, the spacecraft operated in a scanning mode in which it rotated with a period of 35 minutes, scanning out great circles of constant ecliptic longitude. Every twelve hours, the spin axis would be realigned with the Sun, adjusting the longitude of the great circle by roughly half a degree. Thus, afte1r six months, the spacecraft would have scanned the entire sky. After the first 100 days, the scanning was interupted periodically to performed pointed observations. These pointings became more frequent until 9 January, 1979, when the attitude control gas supply ran out. The satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 14 March, 1979. &lt;p&gt; HEAO-1 was equipped with four instrument packages. This file contains an all-sky map made from roughly six months of scanning data from the A2 instrument. The A2 instrument package consisted of six multi-layer multi-anode collimated gas proportional counters. These were two LEDs (Low Energy Detectors), a MED (Medium Energy Detector), and three HEDs (High Energy Detectors). &lt;p&gt; The MED and HEDs has three different collimator configurations. These were 3.0° x 6.0°, 3.0° x 3.0°, and 3.0° x 1.5° (FWHM). The collimators were aligned so the 3.0° response was aligned with the spin axis: Each rotation of the satellite scanned a great circle 3.0° wide passing through the ecliptic poles. &lt;p&gt; Data was accumulated in spectral windows and combined on the spacecraft into "discovery scalars" which covered broad spectral ranges. These, in turn, were combined to form X-ray colors. A number of parameters were altered several times during the mission. Several of the x-ray colors therefore show jumps at periods when the discovery scalers were redefined. Throughout the mission, however, the R15 color was the unweighted sum of x-rays detected in the first and second layer of the HED-3 and the second layer of the MED. The weights which define the other colors (total, hard, and soft) are chosen so that a source characterized by a photon index of -1.7 which produces 1 R15 count/sec will also produce 1 Total (or 1 Soft or 1 Hard) count/sec. R15 is thus the most stable color while total has the most signal; the 6 month period beginning on day 322 of 1977 contains no redefinitions of discovery scalers and has relatively high scanning exposure over most of the sky. &lt;p&gt; Scanning data from the A2 instrument was derived from the DSDISK database developed by Frank Marshall (NASA-GSFC). Data which can be extracted from this database includes the MED and HED-3 detectors. The available fields of view for these detectors are 3.0 x 1.5 (small) and 3.0 x 3.0 (large). &lt;p&gt; Data was extracted from the DSDISK database into 25° square maps by programs provided by Keith Jahoda (NASA-GSFC). Looping through execution of these programs permitted the creation of a full sky map. Software written by Jesse Allen (Hughes-STX) has converted these all-sky maps into FITS format. These original maps are stored in the anonymous FTP area on HEASARC's Legacy computer, located at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. These original maps have also been transformed from their native format to familiar astrophysical projections in ecliptic, celestial (equatorial), and galactic coordinates. Ecliptic data is available in both an unprocessed and processed format. Celestial and galactic data is only available in the processed format. Two forms of processing have been used: sampling (in which data missing due to pointed observations, transmission errors, etc, was reconstructed) and blurring (in which data was smoothed over the size of the instrument beam). See Allen, Jahoda, and Whitlock (1994) for full details about the available maps, their processing, and methods for converting the map intensities into familiar physical units.</TD>

                    <TD>This survey was generated from all available ROSAT HRI observations. Data were mosaicked into 1.1 degree tiles by SkyView. Exposure maps were generated for each HRI observation using the hriexpmap FTOOL. For each tile, all observations that might contribute to that tile were located and added to count and exposure map tiles. Exposures for each observation were calculated using a nearest neighbor interpolation of the center of the tile pixels to the exposure map pixels. Counts were computed by projecting the RA and Decs of each eligible photon into the appropriate tile pixel. Only photons with a PHA &gt; 3 were included in the mosaic and within each observation only counts within the region where the exposure was greater than half the maximum exposure were included.</TD>

                    <TD>The INTEGRAL observatory (Winkler et al. 2003, A&amp;A, 411, L1) was launched in October 2002. The spectrograph SPI (Vedrenne et al. 2003, A&amp;A, 411, L63) consists of 19 Germanium detectors and is capable of imaging in the 20 - 8000 keV band because of a coded mask. Part of the core program of the INTEGRAL mission is a study of the Galactic Centre, the Galactic Centre Deep Exposure (GCDE).&lt;p&gt; The SPI significance map is based on the public GCDE data and uses data in the 20 - 40 keV energy range. The analysis of the data was done using the SPIROS software (Skinner &amp; Connell 2003, A&amp;A, 411, L123). This software uses the 'Iterative Removal of Sources' technique in order to find the most significant sources. In the output significance map the sources found in this process are put on top of the residual map as points with a FWHM of 1 degree. &lt;p&gt; Current data respresent the combination of all public observations as of September 1, 2004.</TD>

                    <TD>The IRAS data include all data distributed as part of the IRAS Sky Survey Atlas. Data from the four IRAS bands are shown as individual surveys in SkyView. Users should be aware that IPAC does not encourage the use of data near the ecliptic plane as they feel that contribution from local cirrus emission is significant. &lt;p&gt; The data are distributed in sets of 430 maps. Each map covers approximately 12.5x12.5 degrees, and the map centers are offset by 5 degrees so that there is a 2.5 degree overlap. IPAC has processed to a uniform standard so that excellent mosaics of the maps can be made. Users should be cautious of data in saturated regions. Known problems in the analysis mean that data values are unlikely to be correct. Note that IPAC has optimized the processing of these data for features of 5' or more although the resolution of the data is closer to the 1.5' pixel size. &lt;p&gt; There are occasional pixels in the IRAS maps which are given as NULL values. Unless these are explicitly trapped by user software, these data will appear as large negative values. SkyView ignores these pixels when determining the color scale to display an image. &lt;p&gt; Essentially the entire sky is covered by the survey. However there are a few regions not surveyed and the data values in these regions are suspect. These are given to users as delivered from IPAC.</TD>

                    <TD>Improved Reprocessing of the IRAS Survey</TD>
                    <TD>The IRIS data is a reprocessing of the IRAS data set and has the same geometry as the IRAS Sky Survey Atlas (ISSA, labeled as IRAS nnn micron in &lt;i&gt;SkyView&lt;/i&gt;) surveys. This new generation of IRAS images, called IRIS, benefits from a better zodiacal light subtraction, from a calibration and zero level compatible with DIRBE, and from a better destriping. At 100 micron the IRIS product is also a significant improvement from the Schlegel et al. (1998) maps. IRIS keeps the full ISSA resolution, it includes well calibrated point sources and the diffuse emission calibration at scales smaller than 1 degree was corrected for the variation of the IRAS detector responsivity with scale and brightness. The uncertainty on the IRIS calibration and zero level are dominated by the uncertainty on the DIRBE calibration and on the accuracy of the zodiacal light model. &lt;p&gt; More information about the IRIS dataset is available at &lt;a href=http://www.citi.utoronto.edu/~mamd/IRIS&gt; the IRIS Web site&lt;/a&gt; whence most of the preceding description came.</TD>

                    <TD>Near-Earth Asteriod Tracking System Archive</TD>
                    <TD>The NEAT/SkyMorph survey provides access to the archives of the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) project. NEAT is designed to look for potentially hazardous asteroids, i.e., those whose orbits cross the Earth's. Over 200,000 images are available in the NEAT archive. &lt;a href=http://skys.gsfc.nasa.gov/skymorph/skymorph.html&gt;SkyMorph&lt;/a&gt; provides a Web interface to the NEAT images and allows users to select all images in which a given fixed or moving object is found. &lt;p&gt; Unlike most &lt;i&gt;SkyView&lt;/i&gt; surveys, the NEAT data are extremely irregular in their spatial distribution. &lt;i&gt;SkyView&lt;/i&gt;'s algorithms for mosaicking images together to form large images are not adequate for the NEAT data, so mosaicking is surpressed. Only data within a single NEAT image will be displayed. The system attempts to find the most recent image within which has a offset in both RA and Dec of less than 0.8 degrees. If no such image is found, then an image with the minimum offset is returned, or the search may fail altogether if there are no nearby plates. The NEAT telescope uses an array of 4 CCDs. The backgrounds of the CCDs may differ significantly. &lt;p&gt; The NEAT survey covers approximately 30% of the sky. Extreme southern and low-Galactic latitude regions are unsurveyed. Coverage is otherwise particularly dense in the ecliptic plane. &lt;p&gt; NEAT data consists primarily of groups of three images taken with separations of 20 minutes and almost identical positions. &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt; will normally return the last of a 'triplet'. The SkyMorph site can be used to display an overlay of triplets to look for targets which moved during the interval between images. &lt;p&gt; A catalog of objects detected in the NEAT/SkyMorph pages is accessible through the SkyMorph pages. 'Light-curves' from all images during which an object was in the NEAT field of view can also be generated. &lt;P&gt; The NEAT data values are in arbitrary density units. To enhance the display data are transformed such that all pixels below the median values are scaled linearly to values 0-20, while all pixels above the median are shifted (but not scaled) to values greater than 20.</TD>

                    <TD>The NRAO VLA Sky Survey is currently underway at the VLA and data is made available to the public as soon as processed. &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt; has copied the NVSS intensity data from the NRAO FTP site. The full NVSS survey data includes information on other Stokes parameters. Note that &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt; may be slightly out of date with regard to the latest releases of NVSS data. The current information was copied in November 1997. &lt;P&gt; The NVSS survey is included on the &lt;b&gt;SkyView High Resolution Radio Coverage &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/high_res_radio.jpg"&gt; map&lt;/a&gt;. This map shows coverage on an Aitoff projection of the sky in equatorial coordinates. &lt;p&gt;</TD>

                    <TD>&lt;P&gt; The ROSAT PSPC surveys were generated by &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt; as mosaics from publically available PSPC observations. The original survey included all data available before October 1, 1994. The revised surveys include all data available through March 1, 1997. This includes the vast majority of ROSAT PSPC observations. Filter observations and observations taken during the verification phase in 1991 were not included in either set. The details of the generation of the surveys are discussed in a &lt;a href="http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/help/pspc_generation.html"&gt; companion document&lt;/a&gt;. Basically the counts and exposure from all observations were added and then an intensity map was generated as the ratio of the two. &lt;p&gt; The revised data generally should be used for all processing. The older survey is currently being retained for compatibility purposes but may be deleted if usage drops off. &lt;p&gt; Nine new &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt; surveys have actually been added. Only two of these are immediately visible within the Form interfaces, but all surveys can be accessed through the Batch and Java systems. The surveys include intensity, counts and exposure maps for data where each observation was cut-off at at circles of 2°, 1° and 0.6° respectively. The 2° intensity survey is essentially a redoing of the older survey. &lt;p&gt; The smaller cut-offs allow users to distinguish point sources in fields where a bright source may have been towards the edge of one observation and near the center of another. In these cases the source appears fuzzy due to the poor resolution of ROSAT near the edge of the field of view. This comes at the cost of a substantial reduction in the fraction of the sky covered. Counts and exposure maps are included for users who may need this information (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt;, to do statistical analysis). &lt;p&gt; There is one major difference between the old survey and the new data. In the old survey a pixel value of 0 may indicate either that the exposure at that pixel was 0 or that there were no counts in that pixel. In the new intensity maps, a pixel value of 0 indicates that there was non-zero exposure but no counts. A pixel value of -1 indicates that there was zero exposure at a given pixel (for the chosen cut-off radius). &lt;P&gt; The global organization of the surveys is similar to the IRAS survey. Each map covers an area of 2.5°x2.5° with a minimum overlap of 0.25°. To cover the entire sky would require over 10,000 maps. However due to lack of coverage only approximately 4000-6000 maps are actually populated. Users asking for reqions where there is no ROSAT coverage may get a blank region returned. &lt;p&gt; In the forms interface, a user who requests a ROSAT image will find that the returned page has links to the other 9 ROSAT PSPC surveys for the equivalent region in the sky. Note that these links are simply a convenience to the user. &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt; has not generated the images in advance, just formatted a &lt;i&gt; SkyView &lt;/i&gt; request. The 0.6 degree intensity maps and all of the exposure and counts maps are suppressed from the initial forms to simplify these forms. All surveys may be retrieved directly using the Batch and Java interfaces. &lt;P&gt; Detailed information regarding the creation of the ROSAT suveys can be found in the &lt;a href="http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/help/pspc_generation.html"&gt; ROSAT PSPC Generation Document&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;P&gt; &lt;B&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; From April to October 1997, it was discovered that approximately 10% of the ROSAT PSPC data were in error. The data have been fixed. Comparing data obtained from this period against the Old PSPC survey can serve as a first order approximation as to whether the data are in err.</TD>

                    <TD>&lt;i&gt; The following is adapted from the MPI FTP site information: 7/16/97 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; These maps present the initial version of the results from the ROSAT soft X-ray all-sky survey as presented in ApJ 454, 643. The maps cover approximately 98% of the sky in the 1/4 keV, 3/4 keV, and 1.5 keV bands, with about 2° angular resolution and high sensitivity for low surface brightness extended features. The effects of non-X-ray contamination and X-rays of solar system origin have been eliminated to the greatest possible extent, but discrete X-ray sources have not been removed. The much improved angular resolution, statistical precision, and completeness of coverage of these maps reveals considerable structure over the entire 0.1-2.0 keV energy range that was not observed previously. The data compare well with previous all-sky surveys in terms of absolute normalization and zero point. These maps may be used for scientific purposes as long as reference is made to the relevant publication</TD>

                    <TD>The ROSAT All-Sky X-ray Survey was obtained during 1990/1991 using the ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) in combination with the ROSAT X-ray Telescope (XRT). More than 60,000 X-ray sources were detected during this time. &lt;p&gt; SkyView has three sets of surveys derived from the RASS data. The surveys whose names begin with RASS3 are counts maps. The surveys with the names RASS or RASSINT are intensity images. These are simply the ratios of the counts maps and the exposure images produced by MPE. Both the counts maps and the intensity images have 45" pixels. A third set of RASS surveys is available int the surveys labeled RASS(.25|.75|1.5)keV. These are lower resolution intensity surveys (40.5' pixels) wiprith where point sources have been removed. They give the best sense of the background X-ray flux. &lt;p&gt; For the full-resolution RASS intensity surveys data are organized in 1378 RASS fields each 6.4° x 6.4° covering the whole sky. Neighboring fields overlap by at least 0.23°.&lt;p&gt; Three bands are available through &lt;i&gt;SkyView&lt;/i&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt; broad band (0.1-2.4 keV) &lt;LI&gt; hard band (0.5-2.0 keV) &lt;LI&gt; soft band (0.1-0.4 keV) &lt;/ul&gt;</TD>

                    <TD>RXTE Allsky 3-20keV Significance</TD>
                    <TD>Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer was launched at the end of 1995 and up to now (2004) it has been successfully operating for more than 7 years. The mission was primarily designed to study the variability of X-ray sources on time scales from sub-milliseconds to years. The maneuvering capability of the satellite combined with the high photon throughput of its main detector (PCA) and high quality of background prediction (thanks to PCA intrumental group of LHEA, GSFC) has also made it possible to construct maps of the sky in energy band 3-20 keV. During its life time RXTE/PCA has collected a large amount of data from slew observations covering almost the entire sky. We have utilized the slew parts of all RXTE/PCA observations performed from April 15, 1996-July 16, 2002 which amounts in total to approximately 50,000 observations. The exposure time at a given point in the map is typically between 200-500 seconds. The observational period before April 15, 1996 (High Voltage Epochs 1 and 2) was excluded from the analysis because during that time the PCA had significantly different gain and dependence of the effective area on energy. The data reduction was done using standard tools of the LHEASOFT with a set of packages written by M. Revnivtsev (HEAD/IKI, Moscow; MPA, Garching).&lt;p&gt; The survey has several features. It has strongly different exposure times at different points on the sky that lead to strong variability of the statistical noise on images. Because of that the only meaningful representation of images is the map in units of statistical significance. After the detection of a source flux can be determined from the map in the 'flux' units. Map resolution is determined mainly by the slew rate of the RXTE (&lt;0.05-0.1°/sec) and the time resolution of used data (16 sec, Std2 mode of the PCA). Sources can be detected down to the level of ~6e&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but at this level the confusion starts to play an important role. Details of the survey are presented in the paper of Revnivtsev et al. (2004).</TD>

                    <TD>The Southern H-Alpha Sky Survey Atlas is the product of a wide-angle digital imaging survey of the H-alpha emission from the warm ionized interstellar gas of our Galaxy. This atlas covers the southern hemisphere sky (declinations less than +15 degrees). The observations were taken with a robotic camera operating at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. The atlas consists of 2168 images covering 542 fields. There are four images available for each field: &lt;b&gt;H-alpha&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Continuum&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Continuum-Corrected&lt;/b&gt; (the difference of the H-alpha and Continuum images), and &lt;b&gt;Smoothed&lt;/b&gt; (median filtered to 5 pixel, or 4.0 arcminute, resolution to remove star residuals better). The &lt;a href="http://amundsen.swarthmore.edu/SHASSA"&gt;SHASSA web site&lt;/a&gt; has more details of the data and the status of this and related projects. Images can also be obtained from the &lt;a href="http://amundsen.astro.swarthmore.edu/SHASSA/#Images"&gt;Download Images&lt;/a&gt; section at the SHASSA site.</TD>

Users tell SkyView the position, scale and orientation desired, and SkyView gives users an image made to their specification. The user need not worry about transforming between equinoxes or coordinate systesm, mosaicking submaps, rotating the image,.... SkyView handles these geometric issues and lets the user get started on astronomy.</TD>

                    <TD>The Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) is a deep radio survey at 843 MHz of the entire sky south of declination -30°, made using the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (&lt;a href="http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/astrop/most/"&gt; MOST &lt;/a&gt;), located near Canberra, Australia. The images from the SUMSS are produced as 4 x 4 degree mosaics of up to seventeen individual observations, to ensure even sensitivity across the sky. The mosaics slightly overlap each other. &lt;p&gt; As of 3/19/2000 35% of the survey has been completed. This is an early release of the data. Please note that the images still contain some telescope artifacts. Images can also be obtained from the &lt;a href="http://www.astrop.physics.usyd.edu.au/cgi-bin/postage.pl"&gt;SUMSS Postage Stamp Server&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;p&gt; The SUMSS is intended to complement the NRAO-VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) which covered the sky between +90 and -40 deg declination, at a frequency of 1400MHz. &lt;p&gt; The SUMSS survey is included on the &lt;b&gt;SkyView High Resolution Radio Coverage &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/high_res_radio.jpg"&gt; map&lt;/a&gt;. This map shows coverage on an Aitoff projection of the sky in equatorial coordinates.</TD>

                    <TD>The Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (&lt;i&gt;WENSS&lt;/i&gt;) is a low-frequency radio survey that covers the whole sky north of delta=30 degree at a wavelength of 92 cm to a limiting flux density of approximately 18 mJy (5 sigma). This survey has a resolution of 54" x 54" cosec (delta) and a positional accuracy for strong sources of 1.5''. &lt;p&gt; Further information on the survey including links to catalogs derived from the survey is available at the &lt;a href="http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/wenss"&gt; &lt;i&gt;WENSS&lt;/i&gt; web site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;p&gt; The &lt;i&gt;WENSS&lt;/i&gt; survey is included on the &lt;b&gt;SkyView High Resolution Radio Coverage &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/high_res_radio.jpg"&gt; map&lt;/a&gt;. This map shows coverage on an Aitoff projection of the sky in equatorial coordinates. &lt;p&gt;</TD>

                    <TD>The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database Image Data Atlas</TD>
                    <TD>NED is built around a master list of extragalactic objects for which cross-identifications of names have been established, accurate positions and redshifts entered to the extent possible, and some basic data collected. Bibliographic references relevant to individual objects have been compiled, and abstracts of extragalactic interest are kept on line. Detailed and referenced photometry, position, and redshift data, have been taken from large compilations and from the literature. NED also includes images for over 773,000 extragalactic objects from 2MASS, from the literature, and from the Digitized Sky Survey. NED's data and references are being continually updated, with revised versions being put on-line every 2-3 months.</TD>

A dedicated 2.5m telescope is specially designed to take wide field (3 degrees in diameter) images using a 5x6 mosaic of 2048x2048 CCD`s, in five wavelength bands, operating in drift scan mode. The total raw data will exceed 40 TB. A processed subset, of about 1 TB in size, will consist of 1 million spectra, positions and image parameters for over 100 million objects, plus a mini-image centered on each object in every color. The data will be made available to the public after the completion of the survey</TD>

                    <TD>The Hubble Space Telescope Press Release Image Archive is a pointed image archive of press release images from the Hubble Space Telescope. The resource provides a conditionally compliant simple image access (SIA) interface to access the image archive. SIA 1.0 compliance is conditional because press release images, in general, do not retain specific observation parameters like observation date and spectral bandpass. The TIFF or JPEG format images are highly processed (i.e., unsuited for astronomical analysis), and may contain annotations on top of the astronomical image. All images have associated valid world coordinate system metadata. Identical images may be available in the archive with different access identifiers, different image formats, or different pixel resolutions.</TD>

Centered on the Chandra Deep Field-South, it covers an area of ~ 28'x28', or about 120 HDF areas, to a depth of MAB(F606W)=28.5(5s) for compact sources. Focusing on the redshift range ~ 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.1, GEMS provides morphologies and structural parameters for nearly 10,000 galaxies where redshift estimates, luminosities, and SEDs exist from COMBO-17.</TD>

Radial Extinction Profiles from Counts of Distant Galaxies Seen through Foreground Disks (2005, AJ,129:1396-1411). The majority of the data are from the Cepheid distance scale Key Project. The explicit goal was to provide deep mosaics in both V- and I-band with a better sampling in order to identify background galaxies through the foreground disk.</TD>

                    <TD>A pictorial atlas of UV (2300 Å) images, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object Camera, of the central 22''× 22'' of 110 galaxies (Maoz, Filippenko, Ho, Macchetto, Rix, &amp; Schneider 1996). The observed galaxies are an unbiased selection constituting about one half of a complete sample of all large (D&gt;6 arcmin) and nearby (V&lt; 2000 km/s ) galaxies. This is the first extensive UV imaging survey of normal galaxies. The data are useful for studying star formation, low-level nuclear activity, and UV emission by evolved stellar populations in galaxies. At the HST resolution (~ 0.05''), the images display an assortment of morphologies and UV brightnesses. These include bright nuclear point sources, compact young star clusters scattered in the field or arranged in circumnuclear rings, centrally-peaked diffuse light distributions, and galaxies with weak or undetected UV emission. We measure the integrated ~2300 Å flux in each image, and classify the UV morphology.</TD>

                    <TD>Images from the initial data release (IDR) of the INT Photometric Halpha Survey (IPHAS). The survey as a wholeis mapping the northern Galactic Plane in the latitude range |b|&lt;5 deg in the Halpha, r' and i' bands using the Wide Field Camera on the 2.5-m INT telescope at La Palma to a depth of r'=20 (10????). The IDR (Gonzalez-Solares et al. 2007) contains the data obtained between September 2003 and December 2005 during a total of 212 nights. Between these dates, approximately 60 percent of the total survey area was covered in terms of final survey quality.</TD>

                    <TD>A catalog containing milliarcsecond-accurate positions of 1332 extragalactic radio sources distributed over the northern sky is presented-the Very Long Baseline Array Calibrator Survey (VCS1). The positions have been derived from astrometric analysis of dual- frequency 2.3 and 8.4 GHz VLBA snapshot observations; in a majority of cases, images of the sources are also available. These radio sources are suitable for use in geodetic and astrometric experiments, and as phase-reference calibrators in high-sensitivity astronomical imaging. The VCS1 is the largest high-resolution radio survey ever undertaken and triples the number of sources available to the radio astronomy community for VLBI applications. In addition to the astrometric role, this survey can be used in active galactic nuclei, Galactic, gravitational lens, and cosmological studies.</TD>

The observations are performed in a "snapshot" observing mode (1 scan per hour of 4-5 minute duration, over a 8 hour period). We achieve a dynamic range of typically exceeding 1000:1, with a typical noise limit (rms) of 0.35 milli-Jansky.</TD>

                    <TD>The "TNO Search Field" images are the sidereally summed images of a search for trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) using the Wide Field Camera of the HST/ACS instrument. The observations were taken under Cycle 11 program GO-9433, "The Size Distribution of Kuiper Belt Bodies," with G. Bernstein as PI. The TNO search consisted of approximately 96x400 s exposures in the F606W filter for each of six contiguous ACS fields of view. The TNO search field is approximately 6'x10', centered near 14h 07M 53.3s -11d 21' 38" (J2000).</TD>

                    <TD>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a project to survey a 10000 square degree area on the Northern sky over a 5 year period. A dedicated 2.5m telescope is specially designed to take wide field (3 degrees in diameter) images using a 5x6 mosaic of 2048x2048 CCD`s, in five wavelength bands, operating in drift scan mode. The total raw data will exceed 40 TB. A processed subset, of about 1 TB in size, will consist of 1 million spectra, positions and image parameters for over 100 million objects, plus a mini-image centered on each object in every color. The data will be made available to the public after the completion of the survey</TD>

A dedicated 2.5m telescope is specially designed to take wide field (3 degrees in diameter) images using a 5x6 mosaic of 2048x2048 CCD`s, in five wavelength bands, operating in drift scan mode. The total raw data will exceed 40 TB. A processed subset, of about 1 TB in size, will consist of 1 million spectra, positions and image parameters for over 100 million objects, plus a mini-image centered on each object in every color. The data will be made available to the public after the completion of the survey</TD>

                    <TD>The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope UIT was one of three ultraviolet telescopes on the ASTRO-1 mission flown on the space shuttle Columbia during 2-10 December 1990. The same three instruments were later flown on the space shuttle Endeavour from 3-17 March 1995, as part of the ASTRO-2 mission. Exposures were obtained on 70-mm photographic film in the 1200-3300 Å range using broadband filters and later digitized using a Perkin-Elmer microdensitometer. Image resolution was 3" over a 40' field of view. Overall, UIT-1 obtained 821 exposures of 66 targets, and UIT-2 obtained 758 images of 193 targets.</TD>

                    <TD>Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) is a systematic survey of the North and South Galactic caps begun in 1993, using the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) . Typical images are comprised of 1150x1550 1.8" pixels with 5" resolution. Source catalogs are also available including peak and integrated flux densities generated from the high resolution coadded images. The survey yields very accurate (&lt;1 arcsec rms) radio positions of faint (&gt;1 mJy/beam) compact sources. The areas observed were chosen to coincide with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.</TD>

                    <TD>The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is a Director's Discretionary program on HST in Cycle 5 to image a typical field at high galactic latitude in four wavelength passbands as deeply as reasonably possible. In order to optimize observing in the time available, a field in the northern continuous viewing zone (CVZ) was selected and images were taken for 10 consecutive days, or approximately 150 orbits. Shorter 1-orbit images were also obtained of the fields immediately adjacent to the primary HDF in order to facilitate spectroscopic follow-up by ground- based telescopes. The observations were carried out from 18-30 December 1995, and the data are available to the community for study.</TD>

                    <TD>A second Hubble Deep Field campaign was carried out between late September and October of 1998. The raw, pipeline calibrated and reprocessed data were released to the community on November 23, 1998. The rationale for undertaking a second deep field campaign followed from the wealth of information that has come out of HDF-N, and from the desire to provide a point of focus for similar studies of the distant universe from southern-hemisphere facilities. Simultaneous, parallel observations were made with the three HST instruments STIS, WFPC2 and NICMOS of separate, neighboring fields. As was the case for HDF-N, approximately 150 consecutive orbits were devoted to a single telescope pointing.</TD>

                    <TD>For the 14 hours of peak Leonid meteoroid flux in November 2002, the Hubble Space Telescope was pointed away from the radiant, and the solar arrays were oriented to minimize their cross-section. By coincidence, one of the nearest and largest planetary nebulae, the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293), was nearly opposite the incoming Leonids and could be observed. A "Hubble Helix Team" (below) of volunteers led by Margaret Meixner (STScI) organized a nine-orbit campaign to observe the Helix with the ACS, WFPC2, NICMOS, and STIS.</TD>

                    <TD>The Chandra X-ray Observatory is the U.S. follow-on to the Einstein Observatory. Chandra was formerly known as AXAF, the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility, but renamed by NASA in December, 1998. Originally three instruments and a high-resolution mirror carried in one spacecraft, the project was reworked in 1992 and 1993. The Chandra spacecraft carries a high resolution mirror, two imaging detectors, and two sets of transmission gratings. Important Chandra features are: an order of magnitude improvement in spatial resolution, good sensitivity from 0.1 to 10 keV, and the capability for high spectral resolution observations over most of this range.</TD>

                    <TD>Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey</TD>
                    <TD>The Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) is an international collaborative program which has obtained high-resolution radio images of over 10000 flat-spectrum radio sources in order to create the largest and best studied statistical sample of radio-loud gravitationally lensed systems. With this survey, combined with detailed studies of the lenses found therein, constraints can be placed on the expansion rate, matter density, and dark energy (e.g. cosmological constant, quintessence) content of the Universe that are complementary to and independent of those obtained through other methods. CLASS is aimed at identifying lenses where multiple images are formed from compact flat-spectrum radio sources, which should be easily identifiable in the radio maps. Because CLASS is radio-based, dust obscuration in lensing galaxies is not a factor, and the relative insensitivity of the instrument to environmental conditions leads to nearly uniform sensitivity and resolution over the entire survey.</TD>

                    <TD>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a project to survey a 10000 square degree area on the Northern sky over a 5 year period. A dedicated 2.5m telescope is specially designed to take wide field (3 degrees in diameter) images using a 5x6 mosaic of 2048x2048 CCD`s, in five wavelength bands, operating in drift scan mode. The total raw data will exceed 40 TB. A processed subset, of about 1 TB in size, will consist of 1 million spectra, positions and image parameters for over 100 million objects, plus a mini-image centered on each object in every color. The data will be made available to the public after the completion of the survey</TD>

                    <TD>The MACHO Project Image Archive SIAP Service</TD>
                    <TD>The MACHO Project was a collaboration between scientists at the Mt. Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories, the Center for Particle Astrophysics at the Santa Barbara, San Diego, and Berkeley campuses of the University of California, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Our primary aim was to test the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way is made up of objects like brown dwarfs or planets: these objects have come to be known as MACHOs, for MAssive Compact Halo Objects. The signature of these objects is the occasional amplification of the light from extragalactic stars by the gravitational lens effect. The amplification can be large, but events are extremely rare: it was necessary to monitor photometrically several million stars for a period of 10 years in order to obtain a useful detection rate. For this purpose we built a two channel system that employed eight 2048*2048 CCDs, mounted on the 50 inch telescope at Mt. Stromlo. The MACHO project data archive consists of approximately 127,000 two-colour images of fields collected between 1992 and 2003 covering the large and small Magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge and two-colour light-curves for approximately 18 million stars in the LMC and galactic bulge.</TD>

                    <TD>The Improved Reprocessing of the IRAS Survey (IRIS) enhances significantly the general quality of the ISSA plates in the four bands (12, 25, 60 and 100 microns). This new generation of IRAS images, called IRIS, benefits from a better zodiacal light subtraction, from a calibration and zero level compatible with DIRBE, and from a better destriping.

                    <TD>The Online Digitized Sky Surveys (DSS1 &amp; 2) server at the ESO/ST-ECF Archive provides access to the CD-ROM set produced by the Space Telescope Science Institute through its Guide Star Survey group. The images of these surveys are based on photographic data obtained using the Oschin Schmidt Telescope on Palomar Mountain and the UK Schmidt Telescope. The plates were processed into the present compressed digital form with the permission of these institutions. The photographic plates were scanned to a pixel scale of about 1.7 arcseconds per pixel for the POSS, SERC, and Palomar Quick-V surveys, and to about 1.0 arcseconds per pixel for the POSS-II surveys. Images of any part of the sky may be extracted from the DSS, in either FITS or GIF format.</TD>

                    <TD>Swift BAT All-Sky Survey: Significance 100-195 keV</TD>
                    <TD>The BAT Hard X-ray Survey data is a product of the BAT instrument on the Swift observatory. Swift/BAT is a wide field-of-view (70x100 degrees) hard X-ray imager consisting of a coded mask and large array of CdZnTe detectors (5000 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The primary purpose of BAT is the detection gamma-ray bursts and the BAT survey data is collected during the search for gamma-ray bursts. &lt;p&gt; BAT is sensitive in the energy range 14-195 keV. The data from the first 9 months of the survey is divided into 4 energy channels: 14-24, 24-50, 50-100, and 100-195 keV. Each of these is represented as separate survey, and an averaged survey over all bands is also given. &lt;p&gt; The all sky maps are presented in two forms, the significance maps and the flux maps. The significance maps are the count rate divided by the noise (sigma RMS) in a region of the map around the position. The noise is variable across the sky due to variable exposure and systematic noise. The noise is Gaussian and and the significances can be interpreted with the usual Gaussian probabilities. A threshold of 4.8 sigma for the blind detection of sources in the BAT survey corresponds to about 1 false detection on the whole sky. &lt;p&gt; The BAT flux map is scaled from the Crab rate in the survey and normalized to an assumed Crab spectrum of 10.4 E&lt;sup&gt;-2.15&lt;/sup&gt; photons.cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sec/keV. Due to the large number of randomly distributed gamma-ray burst pointings that contribute to any point in the image, this is an accurate characterization for the whole sky. The 4.8 sigma threshold in the 9-month survey covers 80% of the sky at flux threshold of 3.5x10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; ergs/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s in the 14-195 keV band and covers 1/3 of the sky near the ecliptic poles at 2.5x10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; ergs/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s.</TD>

The data was distributed in the NRAO Images from the Radio Sky CD ROM. &lt;p&gt; The original 287x101 tiles had only 1 pixel overlap. To allow higher order resampling, the data were retiled into two hemisphere files of 1726x600 pixels with an overlap of 10 pixels. &lt;p&gt; The southernmost tiles were only 287x100 pixels. We assumed that bottom row of these tiles (as compared with the others) was truncated.</TD>

                    <TD>These maps present maps of ROSAT soft X-ray all-sky survey as presented in Snowden et al, ApJ 485, 125 (1997). The maps cover approximately 98% of the sky. These maps have had all point sources removed These surveys supercede the RASS0.25, RASS0.75 and RASS1.5 Kev surveys previously provided. Those surveys may still be invoked in SkyView using batch and jar tools but are not accessible on the Web page. &lt;p&gt; The seven maps correspond to ranges in the pulse height analysis of the photons detected. Since the energy resolution of the PSPC is poor, there is consider overlap between adjacent bands. &lt;p&gt; The energy range for the bands corresponds to: &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Band&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Energy range (keV)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.11 - 0.284&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.14 - 0.284&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.2 - 0.83&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.44 - 1.01&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.56 - 1.21&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.73 - 1.56&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.05 - 2.04&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; Note the substantial overlap between bands. Each photon detected is assigned to a band based on the pulse height analysis for that photon, but the energy resolution of the detectors is relatively poor. Also note that Band 3 was not included in the reference paper due to poor statistics and background modeling. &lt;p&gt; SkyView has several other sets of surveys derived from ROSAT data with substantially higher resolution and which include point sources. The RASS surveys are derived from the RASS all sky survey. These include count and intensity maps. The PSPC maps are dervived from the PSPC pointed observations which were combined by SkyView. The HRI survey is derived from a similar mosaicking of all HRI observations.</TD>

                    <TD>Galaxy Explorer All Sky Survey: Near UV</TD>
                    <TD>The GALEX, Galaxy Explorer, mission was launched by a Pegasus-XL vehicle on April 28 2003 into a 690km altitude, 29 degree inclination, circular orbit with a 98.6 minute period. The GALEX instrument allows imaging and spectroscopic observations to be made in two ultraviolet bands, Far UV (FUV) 1350-1780A and Near UV (NUV) 1770-2730A. The instrument provides simultaneous co-aligned FUV and NUV images with spatial resolution 4.3 and 5.3 arcseconds respectively. Details of the performance of the instrument and detectors can be found in Morrissey et al. (2007) ApJS, 173, 682. &lt;p&gt; The &lt;i&gt;SkyView&lt;/i&gt; GALEX surveys mosaic the intensity images of All-Sky Survey images. For a given pixel only the nearest image is used. Since a given GALEX observation is circular, this maximizes the coverage compared with default image finding algorithms which use the distance from edge of the image.</TD>
