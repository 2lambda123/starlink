#  Name:
#     Gaia3dVtkOverlayText

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Create and manipulate a text prop

#  Description:
#     Class to create instances of a vtkTextActor and provide methods to
#     manage the related work required to render it in a scene. The TextActor
#     is 2D and designed for displaying coordinates, titles etc. The
#     positioning is with a normalized coordinate system of the viewport and
#     overlays the rendered scene.
