#  Name:
#     Grf3dColours

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Static class for locating and querying AST colours used in the
#     Grf3d interface.

#  Description:
#     This is a static class that offers access to the names and
#     indices of the "standard" AST colours and allows this set to be
#     globally extended (that is over the complete application) by
#     adding new colours with specified indices (these may not
#     overwrite the standard set). Note only for Grf3d/Vtk,
#     see gaia::AstColours for the Tk canvas version.

#  Invocations:
#
#        Grf3dColours object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a Grf3dColours object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Configuration options:

#  Methods:

#  Inheritance:
#     This object inherits no other classes.
