#  Name:
#     LabelCubeFileChooser

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tk] class

#  Purpose:
#     Defines a class for choosing a cube.

#  Description:
#     This class defines a labelled entry field with two buttons. The first
#     button, if pressed, displays a FileChooser for selecting a name from
#     existing files. The second button is a menu button with a list of the
#     cubes that have been already opened. This also supports a Back and
#     Forward concept to move between cubes recently opened and closed.
#     The FileChooser is re-used to keep the context.

#  Invocations:
#
#        LabelCubeFileChooser object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a LabelCubeFileChooser object. The return is
#     the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this widget.

#  Configuration options:
#     See itk_option define declarations below.

#  Methods:
#     See descriptions with method declarations below

#  Inheritance:
#     LabelFileChooser.
