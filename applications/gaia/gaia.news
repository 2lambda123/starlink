  Latest changes:

    The grid overlay and celestial coordinate system toolboxes now
    support Horizon (azel) coordinates.
   
    The coordinate system of a channel map is now matched to that
    of the current cube.

    Fix bug causing a double free core dump when saving modified
    world coordinate systems for NDF data.

    Channel maps now have a marker drawn to display the same position
    in each tile. The average spectral coordinate is also displayed
    and the channel map is given the same coordinate system as the
    used by the cube.

    Extracted spectra can now be saved to NDF and FITS files.

    Spectral can now be sent to PLASTIC-enabled applications using
    the Interop menu in the spectral plot window. Only SPLAT supports
    this at present.

  Release 3.2-0: 28th July 2006.
  ==============================

  The most significant changes in this release are in cube handling. The
  toolbox is now much faster at image slicing and handles FITS cubes as
  well as NDF cubes. It also features an all new, built-in, real-time 
  interactive spectral extraction display, which features point and region
  extraction. It also has new controls for creating channel map images and
  selecting ranges for baseline subtraction. On 64bit platforms cubes greater
  than 2Gb can be handled.

  As part of these cube handling updates, all the image analysis toolboxes now
  also work on cube slices. Spectral analysis features are provided by
  communication with SPLAT-VO, which works outside of GAIA.

  GAIA can now also interoperate with some PLASTIC enabled applications.

  Other major changes in this release are that the version of Skycat has been
  updated (after a long pause of five years) to 2.4.7, along with an update to
  using Tcl/Tk 8.4.11.

  Highlights of the change to Skycat 2.4.7 include a new feature for the
  display of MEFs, and groups of NDFs, as a single image.

  There are also many minor changes in this release of GAIA:


    - GAIA can now display in-line compressed images (such as RICE from WFCAM).
      These are converted into temporary files on the fly and can be
      used with all other tasks within GAIA.

    - The ESP toolbox now reports the mean count along the isophote and plots
      intensity profiles.

    - A rarely seen problem with foreign-file conversion deleting the input
      files has been fixed.

    - The object detection toolbox has been updated to work with SExtractor
      version 2.4.3. This includes Petrosian magnitudes and some windowed
      parameters.

    - The Second U.S. Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalogue (UCAC2) has
      been added to the default list. Existing users will be prompted to
      remove the file $HOME/.skycat/skycat.cfg and re-start GAIA to make this
      available.

    - The 2MASS catalogue query now includes a minimum radius. This change
      will be included with the UCAC2 update.

    - The GAIAIMAGEPICK_DIR environment variable now selects default directory
      for Pick-Image toolbox log file.

    - The image slice now has a option to display the Y axis using a log scale.

    - The cube slice display toolbox now has options for continuously
      looping (including "rock-and-roll").

    - The "Show all coordinates" toolbox now displays coordinates from
      systems with more than 2 axes.
    

  Finally in this release GAIA has undergone major changes in the way that it
  is built and distributed (it is now available in the Starlink CVS repository
  and uses an autotools based build system). During this change IRAF support
  has been dropped, although the IRAF support files are still available in the
  CVS repository.

  Long-term users should note that GAIA is no longer supported by the Starlink
  project, which has been terminated. Most of this new work has been carried
  out for the JAC Hawaii. If you want work on GAIA to continue then support it
  by contacting any current members of the PPARC Astronomy or Science
  committees and making your views known.

  If you have any comments or problems with GAIA then join the Starlink
  support group.

  Previous release notes:
  -----------------------

  Last official Starlink release: GAIA 2.8-0 - 04 November 2004
  =============================================================

  A major release of GAIA incorporating a new NDF cube handling facility.
  GAIA will now detect 3D input data (ideally in NDF format) and display
  slices along one of the extra dimensions. This may be animated.

  You can also create a new image that is a combination of images between
  a range of indices. The tool also shows the world coordinates along the
  extra dimensions. All displayed and created images can be processed like
  any other image, so you can perform photometry, region statistics etc.

  The following minor issues have also been fixed.

    - The astrometry tables now offer a button to project X,Y to RA,DEC
      to complement the reset projection of RA,DEC to X,Y.

    - Contouring toolbox bug fixed. If you entered an incorrect NDF name for
      the second image, the error was never recovered and GAIA had to be
      restarted.

    - GAIA has been relinked against AST to fix a problem when the
      presence of multiple possible astrometries in FITS headers
      causes the image scale to be incorrectly estimated.

    - Printing the "whole image" now works when repeated without exiting
      GAIA.

    - Incompatibilities in the WCS components of NDFs are now ignored (older
      versions of AST cannot read newer encodings).

    - A problem with coordinate readout coupling when using more than one
      interactive slice or XY profile is being used.

    - A error reading the CRPIX values in the blink/compare toolbox has been
      fixed.

  GAIA (2.7-5)
  ============

  GAIA 2.7-5 incorporated two new automated astrometry toolboxes, a major
  re-write of the blink comparison toolbox and many changes and fixes.

  GAIA 2.7-5 offered two new toolboxes based on the Starlink AUTOASTROM
  program. These make it possible to provide a minimum of positional
  information (image centre and scale) and then fit an astrometric
  solution. They also make it possible, for the first time, to fit optical
  distortions. The new toolboxes are available at:

     Image-Analysis->Astrometry Calibration->Automatic position matching

  One is for simple use and the other for advanced use.

  The blink comparison toolbox was substantially upgraded in this release.
  New features are options to alignment to NDF origins or FITS CRPIX values.
  This gives much better behaviour when comparing images of different
  dimensions. Better performance (less flickering artifacts). The ability to
  drag images and enter image coordinate offsets. All images can now be viewed
  together or one-by-one as before. Images should now always scroll and the
  "Refresh" button has been removed.

  Other changes in 2.7-5 release:

     - Spitzer/SIRTF FITS headers, including the optical distortion,
       are now handled.

     - The NDF component chooser now allows the variance component to be
       displayed as expected.

     - A new default percentage autocut option has been added.

     - Shared memory segments under Solaris should now be better behaved.

     - The handling of byte images is changed so FITS BITPIX=8 are correctly
       interpreted as unsigned byte, not signed byte. This change mostly
       effects the XY profile and contouring toolboxes.

     - An attempt to clear old WCS information from images before saving
       is now made.

     - The "gaiadisp" command has been enhanced to load a list of
       images into GAIA.

     - An experimental tabbed interface has been produced to make it
       easier to view FITS MEF files. To try this out use the command:

          $GAIA_DIR/tabbedgaia

     - Long thin or tall images (2 pixels or more) now display a readout of
       positions.

     - The "$GAIA_DIR/pix2wcs" and "$GAIA_DIR/wcs2pix" scripts should be
       working again.

     - The "$GAIA_DIR/displaycat" command now creates fully functional
       catalogue windows (previous these did not include any GAIA specific
       changes).

     - The "-catalog" command-line option now accepts a list of catalogues to
       display immediately.

     - The polarimetry toolbox now correctly processes selection expressions
       when column names are short forms of other names (i.e. when P and PI,
       DP and DPI etc. are used). Previously an attempt to interpret $PI as
       $P would be made and subsequently fail.

     - Making name queries using the RedHat 9 build of GAIA failed
       completely, sometimes causing a core dump from a child process.
       This problem has now been resolved.

     - The interpretation of FITS -CAR projections is now a configuration
       option. Previously this was fixed at assuming that all Cartesian
       projections are simple linear mappings (this remains the default),
       ignoring the possibility of spherical rotations. Refer to the CarLin
       attribute of the AST (SUN/211) library for more about this change.

     - Various changes to grid overlays have been implemented.
       This now supports AST 3.2 super-script and sub-script, font and colour
       changes within a string. Fonts drawn on the overlay grid can now be
       scaled with image. Better matching of postscript font size to displayed
       size has also been implemented. A long term memory leak has been cured
       (only seen when drawing overlays).

     - A new configuration option "always_merge" controls if the primary header
       of any FITS files are merged with those of extension being viewed to
       create a full set of headers for creating a world coordinate system. By
       default this merging no longer occurs when the primary HDU contains a
       non dummy image.

     - Region statistics now also include values for the NDF variance
       component.
