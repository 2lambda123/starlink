\section{Introduction\xlabel{introduction}\label{introduction}}

GAIA is an image display tool (\textit{c.f.} \xref{SAOimage}{sun166}{}), 
but with the additional capability of being extendable to integrate
other programs.  At present extensions are provided that cover the
astronomically interesting areas of aperture \& optimal photometry,
automatic source detection, surface photometry, contouring, arbitrary
region analysis, celestial coordinate readout, calibration and
modification, grid overlays, blink comparison, image defect patching, 
polarization vector plotting and the ability to connect to resources
available in on-line (WWW) catalogues and archives.

GAIA is a derivative of the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{SkyCat}{http://archive.eso.org/skycat/} image
display and catalogue browsing tool, developed as part of the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{VLT}{http://www.eso.org/vlt/} project at
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{ESO}{http://www.eso.org/}. SkyCat is free software
under the terms of the GNU copyright.

\section{\xlabel{getting_started}Getting Started}

The following two sections describe the absolute basics of how to
startup GAIA and how to display images using it. 

%TODO: cookbook not finished for this release.
%If you need help beyond this, and are new to GAIA, then you should
%probably read the `The GAIA CookBook' (\xref{SC/17}{sc17}{}). In
%addition to the usual introductory text this also contains several
%recipes for achieving specific tasks (such as measuring instrumental
%magnitudes and making use of celestial coordinate information).

The other main source of information about GAIA is the on-line
system. This can only be accessed after starting GAIA (just select the
\mytt{Help} menus). Many windows also feature `short help'. This is a
retangular region at the bottom of a window that may display a
one-line description of the window element under the cursor (an
approximation of balloon help).

If you need help beyond what is available in these resources (or have
any suggestions for improvements), then send an email message to:
\begin{quote}
\htmladdnormallink{\mytt{gaia@star.rl.ac.uk}}{mailto:gaia@star.rl.ac.uk}.
\end{quote}
The GAIA home page (which should have a current list of known bugs and
work arounds) is at:
\begin{quote}
\htmladdnormallink{\mytt{http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/gaia/}}{http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/gaia/}.
\end{quote}

\subsection{\xlabel{using_gaia_from_the_cshell}Using GAIA from the C-shell}

To display an image in GAIA use the following command
(assuming that you are already initialized to use Starlink software):
\begin{quote}
\mytt{\% gaia image\_name}
\end{quote}
Alternatively you can use the \mytt{File} menu to load an image.

If you want to display an image in an existing GAIA then use the
invocation:
\begin{quote}
\mytt{\% gaiadisp image\_name}
\end{quote}
You can also write to a specific window using the clone number:
\begin{quote}
\mytt{\% gaiadisp image\_name 2}
\end{quote}
This displays into the window with title \mytt{GAIA::SkyCat (2)}. If
this window doesn't exist it will be created.

\subsection{\xlabel{using_gaia_from_irafcl}Using GAIA from IRAF/CL}

GAIA can be used from the IRAF/CL command-line (providing it has been
installed on your system). Before you can actually run the main program
you first need to initialize the \mytt{gaia} package:
\begin{quote}
\mytt{cl> gaia}
\end{quote}
(you could do this once and for all in your \mytt{login.cl}
file). Next you need to use the \mytt{gaiadisp} command. This command
has two arguments, the name of the image to display and the plane
(\textit{i.e.} GAIA clone) that you want to display into. So for instance
if you wanted to display the default IRAF test image you'd use a
command like:
\begin{quote}
\mytt{cl> gaiadisp dev\$pix.imh 1}
\end{quote}
This will either display into an existing GAIA or start up a new
instance. Note that GAIA is not an IRAF image display and will
consequently not support any IRAF cursor commands.

\section{\xlabel{what_does_it_actually_do}What does it actually do?}

The capabilities of GAIA fall roughly into three areas; those of an
image display tool, those provided for the analysis of images and
those for querying on-line resources (catalogues of images and
data). Each of these areas is described very briefly in the next
sections. As with most graphical tools, probably the best way to find
out about GAIA is to explore it interactively. Failing that many
windows have a one-page description in the on-line help system and
most graphical elements (\textit{buttons, entry fields etc.}) have
one-line descriptions that appear in the short-help region at the
bottom of windows.

Windows that provide a limited range of controls for some kind of
focussed task are called `toolboxes'. In general what they do should
be obvious or they are really front-ends for other software
packages. Good examples of this latter type are the photometry and
object detection toolboxes. When such a toolbox is used the
documentation for the command-line tools is the primary source for
finding out what is going on under the bonnet.

\subsection{\xlabel{image_display_capabilities}Image display capabilities}
GAIA provides the following normal ``image display tool'' features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Display of images in FITS and Starlink \xref{NDF}{sun33}{}
  formats (this also means that it will display many other data formats
  using the on-the-fly data conversion ability of the NDF library, most
  notably the IRAF data format).

\item Panning, zooming, data range and colour table manipulations.

\item Continuous display of the cursor position and the image data
  value.

\item Display of many images (clones), each in its own window.

\item Coloured annotation, using text and line graphics (boxes,
  circles, polygons, lines with arrowheads, ellipses \ldots).

\item Printing of the displayed image and annotations (annotations
  are drawn using printer resolution, \textit{i.e.} not a screen dump)
  to a postscript file.

\item Real time pixel value table. A table displaying the data
  values and simple statistics of a region about the cursor can be
  displayed.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\xlabel{image_analysis_capabilities}Image analysis capabilities}
GAIA provides the following features, which are specifically aimed at
astronomical work with images:
\begin{itemize}
\item Aperture \& optimal photometry. A highly interactive environment
  for controlling the positions, sizes and orientations of circular
  and elliptical apertures. The sky estimates can be made from
  annuli of these apertures or from related sky apertures. The
  measurements can be in either instrumental magnitudes or
  mean counts (based on the PHOTOM - \xref{SUN/45}{sun45}{} -
  program \xref{AUTOPHOTOM}{sun45}{AUTOPHOTOM})

\item Automatic source detection. This feature provides the ability to
  automatically detect and parameterise all the objects on an
  image. These objects are then identified by displaying ellipses over
  the image and are available for interactive inspection. The resultant
  measurements are displayed in a catalogue window which can be used to
  inspect the individual values, select data on the bases of range
  limits and change the appearance of the ellipses. This is based on the
  EXTRACTOR (\xref{SUN/226}{sun226}{}) package, a derivative of
  SExtractor.

\item Extended surface photometry. This allows the interactive
  identification of extended objects (galaxies) and profile
  measurements using ellipse fitting. The resultant fits are shown
  over the images and the measurements can be inspected (based on the
  ESP - \xref{SUN/180}{sun180}{} - programs
  \xref{ELLPRO}{sun180}{ELLPRO} and \xref{ELLFOU}{sun180}{ELLFOU}).

\item Image patching. This provides the ability to select arbitrary
  shaped regions on an image and replace them with a surface fit
  to other regions, together with an artificial noise component.
  An ideal way to remove unwanted defects from an image for
  cosmetic reasons.

\item Interactive ARD (\xref{SUN/183}{sun183}{}) regions. This
  allows the calculation of statistics, the masking out and
  extraction of arbitrary shaped parts of your images as well
  defining ARD regions for other programs to use.

\item Contouring. This allows the contouring of the displayed image,
 or the overlay of contours derived from other images. The images are
 aligned using sky coordinates, if available. Control over individual
 line colours and thicknesses is provided.

\item Polarization vector plotting and manipulation. This provides the
 ability to display vector maps produced by the POLPACK
 (\xref{SUN/223}{sun223}{}) package. It also allows you to select
 sub-sets of vectors, either by algebraic expressions or by rectangular
 regions. Selected parts can be removed or saved to new catalogues. New
 vector maps can be created by binning vectors and reports of the
 properties of selections can be displayed.

\item Blink comparison. All the displayed images can be animated
  (as quickly as your hardware/CPU combination allow), or
  you can cycle through them by hand.

\item Interactive position marking: Mark and label positions on your
  images and print or record them for future reference. This also
  allows positions to be read in from text files and input sky
  coordinates to be transformed to different celestial coordinate
  systems. Mean seeing and shape parameters of any marked stars are
  also available as part of this analysis.

\item Celestial coordinates readout. If your data have suitable
  astrometric calibration data available (in recognised headers
  \textit{i.e.} FITS/IRAF or NDF WCS) then a continuous readout of the
  current RA and Dec is provided.

\item Astrometric calibration. You can either fit a new
  astrometric calibration to your image (using on-line catalogues or
  images for reference positions), define a new one using known
  information (such the image scale and a reference point), copy one
  from another image and finally tweak one to make it fit better.

\item Astrometric grid overlay. If you can read out sky coordinates
  then you can also plot a grid overlay with labelled
  axes. The grid facility is provided with an enormous range of
  customization options, such as being able to change the
  celestial coordinate system (from say FK5 to  Galactic {\em etc.}).

\item Celestial coordinate system control. You can change the celestial
  coordinate system used by your image to a new one (to/from FK5,
  FK4, Ecliptic, Geocentric apparent, Galactic and SuperGalactic).

\item Sky coordinate offsets. This feature also relies on being
  able to read celestial coordinates, if so then you can
  determine the distance and offsets between any two points on
  your image (in arc minutes).

\item Real time profiling. Two separate toolboxes allow you to either 
  move a line around on the image and see the image data values
  displayed as a profile change (this profile can also be saved as a
  spectrum), or do the same with a rectangle, in which case the mean
  profiles along the X and Y directions are shown. 

\item Object parameterization. This allows you to select a single
  object on the image. Details such as its full width half
  maximum, peak intensity {\em etc.} will be shown. These values are
  based on a 2D gaussian fit.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\xlabel{online_catalogue_capabilities}On-line catalogue capabilities}
Using the facilities provided by
\htmladdnormallink{SkyCat}{http://archive.eso.org/skycat}, GAIA is
also capable of using some of the increasingly large amounts of
information available via the World Wide Web. For instance if your
image has a world coordinate system associated with it, you can query
the ESO catalogue of HST guide stars about any located within the
bounds of your image. These will then be listed and plotted over your
image.  Similarly you can query the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{NED}{http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu}
(NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database) and SAO databases (and quite a few
others) and see lists of all the objects that they know about on your
image. You can also display an image returned directly from the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{Digital Sky Survey}
{http://arch-http.hq.eso.org/dss/dss}(and then perform queries in
other catalogues about this field). Named objects from certain
catalogues can have their full information displayed in
\htmladdnormallink{Netscape}{http://home.netscape.com} and may even
have bibliography links to the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{ADS}{http://adswww.harvard.edu} abstract
service.  Finally the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{HST}{http://cadcwww.dao.nrc.ca/hst} archives
are also available. Using these you can see what observations have
been made of any objects on your image (and preview any generally
available).

\end{htmlonly}

{\bf Note:} you should take time to find what your obligations, in
terms of the correct acknowledgement of copyright, use of service
{\em etc.} are, whenever you use facilities such as those mentioned
above.

\subsection{Local catalogues}
SkyCat allows you to save its catalogue queries to a local file. These
can then be re-loaded and plotted as if on-line catalogues. This is
very useful if you need to re-plot catalogues and have a slow network,
but equally useful is the fact that local catalogues may be
modified. So you can edit, sort, select and delete records.

\subsubsection{Catalogue formats}
Local catalogues may be stored in several formats. The ``native''
version is called a ``tab separated table'' (TST). This is a simple
text file in which the values of the various fields are separated by a
single \mytt{<TAB>} character and the catalogue headers are separated
from these by a dashed line:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
#  comment
keyword1: value1
keyword2: value2

...
ID   <TAB>   RA     <TAB>   DEC   <TAB>  MAG     ...
--           --             ---          ---
OBJ1 <TAB>   210.00 <TAB>   54.00 <TAB>  16.1
OBJ2 <TAB>   210.01 <TAB>   54.01 <TAB>  15.1
....
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The usual format of a catalogue is as above, \textit{i.e.} an object identifier
followed by an RA and DEC (in J2000 decimal degrees). Note the
\mytt{<TAB>} strings shouldn't be typed in, they are shown explicitly
just to make clear where they should be placed. The TST format is also
recognised by the CURSA package (\xref{SUN/190}{sun190}{}), which also
contains a description of this format.

Additional formats that can be also read and written by GAIA (with a
performance penalty) are those supported by the \xref{CURSA}{sun190}{}
package (\textit{i.e.} FITS-tables and STL format) and the
``ASCII\_HEAD'' format of the SExtractor/EXTRACTOR package
(\xref{SUN/226}{sun226}{}).

The format that is used to open or write a catalogue, is determined by
the file extension:
\begin{itemize}
\item \mybold{FITS tables}, accepted file types: \mytt{.FIT .fit .FITS .fits .GSC .gsc}
\item \mybold{STL}, accepted file types: \mytt{.TXT .txt}
\item \mybold{ASCII\_HEAD}, accepted file types: \mytt{.asc .ASC .lis .LIS}
\end{itemize}
All other file extensions are assumed to indicate a TST (the preferred
extensions for these are \mytt{.tab} or \mytt{.TAB}).

\subsubsection{Using your own local catalogues}
If you have a simple text file containing columns of positions then
the most straight-forward way to plot them in GAIA is by using the
`Select Positions...' toolbox. This accepts (as do the various
astrometry toolboxes) a file containing the following values:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ID  RA  DEC  X  Y
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
in that order, \textit{e.g.}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
1   00:19:49.47   00:07:25.9   854    50
2   00:20:06.71   00:06:05.3   240   244
3   00:19:47.54   00:04:23.2   925   484
4   00:19:58.07   00:04:49.1   549   424
5   00:19:48.69   00:06:59.0   882   114
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The columns should be space separated and the celestial coordinates
should be in decimal degrees, or as shown above. More complex files
can be imported into this toolbox using its `Import text file...'
option (this allows fixed column widths or other separators). If you
need to import such a file into a catalogue window, (this is the sort
of window that queries to on-line catalogues are shown in, and provide
extra facilities like applying intensity cuts etc.) then use the
\mytt{Import plain text file...} toolbox from the \mytt{Positions...} menu.

You can also create your own local catalogues in TST format. This
allows you to describe how to plot the catalogue. For instance if you
wanted to plot position vectors as correctly orientated lines over an
image you would need a tab table that contained the following sort of
information (again note that the \mytt{<TAB>} string should be replace
by a single tab character):
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
# File created by: pwd on June 15, 1999 at 10:24:04
id_col: 0
x_col: 1
y_col: 2
symbol: {ID LENGTH ANGLE} {line {} {} {$ANGLE+27.0} {} {}} {{$LENGTH*0.1} {}}
#
ID <TAB>    XPOS    <TAB> YPOS    <TAB> LENGTH   <TAB>  ANGLE
--          ----          ---           ------          -----
ID#1 <TAB>  206.000 <TAB> 189.000 <TAB> 6.32528  <TAB>  104.816
ID#2 <TAB>  209.000 <TAB> 189.000 <TAB> 5.86891  <TAB>  109.238
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The \mytt{x\_col} and \mytt{y\_col} parameters indicate the columns of
the data that correspond to the X and Y positions and the symbol
parameter how to plot a line centered on that position. In this case
the statements says extract values for the \mytt{ID}, \mytt{LENGTH}
and \mytt{ANGLE} columns, then draw lines with position angle
\mytt{ANGLE+27} and length \mytt{LENGTH$*$0.1} pixels. Note that a
dollar sign is used to prefix column names in these expressions (in
fact these expressions will be parsed by the Tcl ``expr'' command,
with the column values set to a variable with the same name as the
column for each line in the table).

Creating such a symbol parameter is best done by using the special
\mytt{Set Plot Symbols...} window, available under the local catalogue
menu \mytt{Options}. Using this window you can plot multiple symbols per
object, specify which column to use as labels, change the graphic
colour {\em etc.}. Now if you look in the file
\mytt{\~{}/.skycat/skycat.cfg} after setting up your options a suitable
symbol parameter is recorded together which the description for your
local catalogue (which you can then edit into your tab files).

To find out more about the TST format and how to configure plot
symbols you should consult the ESO document
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{`Astronomical Catalog Library'}
{http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/\~{}pdraper/gaia/docs/cat.ps.gz} and 
`Writing Catalogue and Image Servers for GAIA and CURSA '
(\xref{SSN/75}{ssn75}{}).

\subsubsection{FITS tables} Much of the above also applies to FITS tables
that GAIA will read, \textit{i.e.} FITS keywords with the names
\mytt{X\_COL}, \mytt{Y\_COL} and \mytt{SYMBOL} will be interpreted
correctly. Special parameter names that are longer than 8 characters
(such as \mytt{search\_cols}, \mytt{sort\_order}, \mytt{show\_cols}
and \mytt{copyright}) should be truncated. Long symbol expressions can
span more than one card by using the names: \mytt{SYMBOL1} through
\mytt{SYMBOL9}.

\subsection{\xlabel{image_formats}Accessing images of differing formats}

GAIA can display and perform analyses on many different data
formats. It does this by using the ``on-the-fly'' conversion
facilities of the NDF library, which it uses directly. This on-the-fly
conversion uses external programs that can convert your data from its
current format into an NDF and then back again (if necessary).

The CONVERT \xref{(SUN/55)}{sun55}{} package provides many formats
that are useful for astronomers (\textit{e.g.} FITS, IRAF and old FIGARO
formats) and is automatically used by GAIA (unless you have set up
your own conversion facilities, see \xref{SSN/20}{ssn20}{} if you
think you need to do this). All the formats recognised at any time by
GAIA are shown in a menu in the file chooser, so check this to see
if your format is available.

FITS files are a special case in that GAIA will read these natively
(which gains increased efficiency), however, any external analysis
routines (such as those used in the photometry toolbox) will still
need to be able to convert these files into NDFs, using the on-the-fly
facility, so if you define your own conversion facilities make sure
that you include a FITS converter.

To display any of these images in GAIA just type the full disk-file
name on the command-line (either when you start GAIA or by using the
\mytt{gaiadisp} command), or similarly select the disk-file in the
open file window. 

To display a FITS file extension image, either open the disk file and
choose the extension from the \mytt{HDU} selector window that appears,
or add the extension number to the disk-file name:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
# gaia mef_file.fits'[2]'
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The FITS primary array is number $1$.

A similar mechanism exists for NDFs stored in container files at other
than the top-level:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
# gaia hdscontainer.ndf_1
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
In this case any other NDFs stored at the same level in the container
file will also be shown in a selector window. NDF slices can also be
used:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
# gaia hdscontainer.ndf_1'(200:500,100:700)'
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
This can also be applied to FITS files and other foreign formats, but
note that this means that FITS files will now be accessed as foreign, 
\textit{i.e.} the FITS files will really be NDFs:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
# gaia file.fits'(300:700,300:700)'
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\section{\xlabel{configuration_options}\label{configuration_options}Configuration options}

GAIA has many options that can be defined when starting it up. \textit{These
are best set using the \mytt{Startup options...} window located in the
\mytt{File} menu}, but you also define these on the command-line:

\hspace{2em}
\mytt{
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
 option              &  Meaning \\
\hline
 -default\_cmap      &  Change the default colour map \\
 -with\_colorramp    &  Display a colour ramp \\
 -with\_zoom\_window &  Display a zoom window \\
 -with\_pan\_window  &  Display a pan window \\
 -float\_panel       &  Detach the control panel \\
 -transient\_tools   &  Make toolboxes transient \\
 -demo\_mode         &  Make the demo toolbox available \\
 -component          &  The NDF component (data, variance or quality) \\
 -focus\_follows\_mouse & Image and entry focus follows mouse pointer \\
 -visual             & X visual (pseudocolor, truecolor, visual id)\\
 -quiet\_exit        & Issue a warning before exiting GAIA (default 0)\\
 -extended\_precision & Display RA and Dec at milli-arcsecond resolution
\end{tabular}
}

So for instance if you wanted to float the control panel (useful for
smaller displays) and have a grey default colourmap. Then start
using the command:
\begin{quote}
\mytt{\% gaia image\_name -default\_cmap ramp -float\_panel 1}
\end{quote}
The colour maps available can be found by listing the
\mytt{/star/bin/gaia/colormaps} directory. Or alternatively to save
some space without floating the panel try:
\begin{quote}
\mytt{\% gaia image\_name -with\_zoom\_window 0 -with\_pan\_window 0}
\end{quote}
(\mytt{1} means true and \mytt{0} false).

If you'd like the toolboxes to remain on top of the display window
they are associated with then set the \mytt{transient\_tools} option
to 1 (the precise behaviour you get depends on your window
manager\footnote{Even if you don't have \mytt{transient\_tools} set,
window managers can still cause many perceived problems dealing with
toolboxes. Make sure that you have `autoraise' and `autoraise on first
focus' type options switched off, if you feel that toolboxes and
dialogs unnecessarily take charge of things like the focus.}).

If you prefer to point at the image and text entry fields before using
the keyboard, rather than having to click in them first (versions of
GAIA pre-2.4 used this behaviour by default), then use the command:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
% gaia image_name -focus_follows_mouse 1
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\subsection{\xlabel{proxy_servers}Proxy servers}
Access to the World Wide Web may be restricted (by a firewall or maybe
just site policy), so that it is only available through a ``web
cache'' or proxy server. If you are in this situation you'll need to
configure GAIA so that its remote catalogue access will work.

To do this, start up GAIA, select the \mytt{Data-Servers} menu and
choose any remote catalogue. Now in the catalogue window select the
\mytt{Options} menu and choose the \mytt{Proxies...} item.

Now fill in the two fields (consult your system administrator if you're
unclear what to enter here) and press \mytt{OK}.

\section{\xlabel{gaia_demonstration}GAIA demonstration}
Rather than just absorbing the rather dry descriptions above, you can
see some of GAIA facilities in action in a special demonstration
mode. To activate this set your current working directory to an empty
one (with several megabytes of space free). Now select the item
\mytt{Demonstration mode...}, under the \mytt{Image-Analysis} menu and
answer \mytt{yes} when a dialog window offering to unpack the
demonstration files appears. After a while a toolbox window will
reveal itself, just press the ``Start'' button to see the demo. Note
that the demonstration contains flashing images.

\section{\xlabel{finding_out_more_about_skycat}Finding out more about SkyCat}
\htmladdnormallink{SkyCat}{http://archive.eso.org/skycat/} is being
developed at \htmladdnormallink{ESO}{http://www.eso.org/} as part of
the \htmladdnormallink{VLT}{http://www.eso.org/vlt/} project and much
documentation is available about the internals of how SkyCat (and
consequently GAIA) are constructed. If you are interested in finding
out about these then consult the postscript documents, which you can
find from links on the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{SkyCat
homepage}{http://archive.eso.org/skycat/}. The documents relevant to
the version of SkyCat that GAIA is based on are also available at
\htmladdnormallink{http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/\~{}pdraper/gaia/docs}
{http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~pdraper/gaia/docs}. People who would like
to extend SkyCat or GAIA at the user interface level are recommended
to read about ``SkyCat plugins''.

\section{Recent \xlabel{changes}Changes}

\subsection{Release - 2.6} 
  Release 2.6 includes a new toolbox and various enhancements.

  The new toolbox displays maps of polarization vectors as produced by
  the Starlink POLPACK package (\xref{SUN/223}{sun223}{}). It also
  provides manipulation facilities for selecting map sub-sets and
  allows the map to be re-binned.

  Additional minor changes are:
  \begin{itemize}
     \item You can now choose the secondary coordinate system that GAIA
       displays in the `RA' and `Dec' coordinate readouts. This is
       useful when your images have more than one coordinate system that
       you'd like to view (by default NDFs have `PIXEL' and `AXIS', as
       well as others such as celestial coordinates, FITS files may have
       similar arrangements in the future). As a consequence of these
       changes the `PIXEL' system is now removed from the celestial
       coordinates and grid overlay toolboxes.

     \item SuperCOSMOS surveys are now available. To access these you need
       to remove the file \mytt{\$HOME/.skycat/skycat.cfg}, if it
       exists, and then look in the ``Browse Catalog Directories...''
       dialog under the \mytt{Data-Servers} menu for the sub-list
       \mytt{SuperCOSMOS catalogues}. 


     \item FITS file with more than one period in their names can now be
       displayed by GAIA. However, some toolboxes are effectively
       disabled by this as it breaks the \xref{NDF}{sun33}{} library
       naming conventions for foreign data formats.

     \item The on-line help system has been completely
       re-engineered. This is now based on a hypertext system with text
       search facilities.  Other improvements are the inclusion of
       figures and a more unified presentation.

     \item BITPIX -64 FITS files (i.e. double precision) can now be
       displayed, but note that some external applications that are
       used by GAIA cannot properly process this format
       (e.g. \xref{AUTOPHOTOM}{sun45}{AUTOPHOTOM} and
       \xref{EXTRACTOR}{sun226}{} which are used by the photometry 
       and object detection toolboxes will truncate to single
       precision floating point). 

     \item The contour toolbox now has new options to use a single colour
       and/or width for all lines.

     \item The contour toolbox now has a new option for adding customised
       colours (RGB/CMY/HSV or standard X11) to its drop-down lists.

     \item You can now get a copy of the colour ramp, annotated with
       levels, for inclusion in diagrams.

     \item Importing plain text files of values is now available as an
       option for normal catalogue windows (previously this option just
       imported files into the positions toolbox). This allows files
       that have space, comma, semi-colon and tab separated fields to be
       read, as well as files with fixed-width columns.

     \item The conflict with the \xref{CURSA}{sun190}{} setup for the
       \verb+SKYCAT_CONFIG+ environment variable is now resolved by ignoring
       \verb+SKYCAT_CONFIG+. This was causing GAIA to lock up when used behind 
       a web proxy that had not been configured.

     \item The UKSTU plate library has been removed from the default
       catalogue list. This facility is no longer available.

     \item The irritating 
           \verb+failed to register the shmem:// driver+ 
       warning message should now be silent. This warning was harmless.

     \item The pan window should now work with very thin images (1 pixel wide).

     \item The `autocut' mechanism has been modified to not use the
       DATAMIN and DATAMAX keywords (which are often not the minimum and
       maximum data values in an image) and a bug effecting its
       operation when scaled images were abutted to the top-edge of the
       display has been fixed.

       There have been many complaints that autocuts do not work as
       expected, one reason for this is that the cuts are determined
       by using a sub-sample of the part of the image data that you
       can see, rather than the whole image. One effect of this is
       that percentile cuts will correctly produce different high and
       low levels depending on what part of an image you're looking
       at.

     \item All image access (that is NDFs and FITS files) is now
       performed using file mapping. A consequence of this is that 
       GAIA will now display images up to 2Gb in size on machines with
       more modest physical memory allocations (a 256Mb Linux PC will
       display such images comfortably, but note that any analysis
       operations may need much more memory). If you attempt this
       you will still require a system whose virtual memory size is
       bigger than 2Gb.

     \item An error in the RMS fitting estimate for the astrometric
       toolboxes has been corrected. Previous RMS values were all
       underestimates by a factor $1/\sqrt{n}$.
     
     \item The rendering of ellipses drawn as graphics overlays (such
       as those used to show object detections) has been improved,
       especially at low resolutions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Release 2.6-9}

This release contains a few updates. 
\begin{itemize}
   \item New X\_PIXEL and Y\_PIXEL parameters have been added to object
     detection toolbox (these report pixel coordinates, i.e. include
     any origin information).

   \item Non-transient pop-up windows that grabbed the focus during their
     creation (for instance the NDF chooser) have had their behaviour
     modified to not grab the focus.

   \item While processing FITS astrometries stored in NDFs a report to
     the terminal about missing FITS keywords followed by a failure to
     load the image (with a dialog message about `missing data
     component') could occur. This problem is now fixed.

   \item The astrometry fitting toolboxes (using reference positions) have
     been upgraded to accept RA and Dec values with space separations.
     Note that in general you should use colons as the separators.

   \item The image print window has been modified to swap the page width
     and length values when changing between landscape and portrait
     formats. This should make better use of the full page by default.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{This release - 2.6-10}

New to this release:
\begin{itemize}

    \item When North and East are interchanged the \mytt{Show all
    coordinates} toolbox displayed the wrong coordinates in the left
    and right columns, and incorrectly formatted RA as DD:MM:SS and
    Dec as HH:MM:SS. These problems are now fixed.

    \item The direction arrows shown in the pan window could be
    displayed at the wrong size, again when North and East where
    interchanged. This problem is now fixed.
   
    \item The command-line options of GAIA can now be configured using
    the new \mytt{File->Startup options} window. The set of options
    selected are used whenever GAIA starts up (this removes the
    tedious need to either specify these on the command-line, or add
    them to your X resources).

    \item A new configuration option \mytt{-extended\_precision} has
    been added. This makes GAIA work at approximately milli-arcsecond
    resolution. This option can be switched on using the new
    \mytt{File->Startup options} window.
\end{itemize}
