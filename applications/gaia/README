            GAIA -- Graphical Astronomy and Image Analysis Tool
            ===================================================

This directory contains a release of Starlink GAIA.

GAIA(1) is an image display and analysis tool for astronomy. It can
handle images in the Starlink(2) specific NDF format and the more
generally recognised FITS format.

GAIA is a derivative of the SkyCat(3) image display and catalogue
browsing tool, developed as part of the VLT(4) project at ESO(5).

GAIA provides the usual facilities of image display tools -- display,
pan, zoom, colour table manipulations -- plus a comprehensive set of
more astronomically useful ones such as aperture & optimal photometry,
contouring, source detection, surface photometry, arbitrary region
analysis, celestial coordinate readout, calibration and modification,
grid overlays, blink comparison, defect patching and the ability to
query on-line (WWW) catalogue for catalogues and images.

To get started look at the main document SUN/214 (Starlink User Note
214), which should be part of the release. Try the command:

   % showme sun214

Or alternatively look for the "sun214.htx" directory and load the
"sun214.html" file into a HTML browser. GAIA has an on-line help
system which should be consulted next.

If you have any comments, bug reports etc. about GAIA then email
"GAIA support" at:

   gaia@star.rl.ac.uk

Releases of GAIA should be found at the "Starlink Software Store":

   http://www.starlink.ac.uk/store/store.html

or can be obtained on a Starlink CDROM release, also available from
the Starlink web site. Source code for GAIA should be also available
at that site, or contact GAIA support.

General Public License. See the files GAIA_CONDITIONS and COPYING for
