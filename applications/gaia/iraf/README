These are the support files for running GAIA from IRAF cl.

They are no longer supported, but that doesn't mean they will
no longer work. The positions of these files was:

 % ls -R /star/iraf/gaia/
 /star/iraf/gaia/:
 doc      gaiacut.cl         gaiadisp.cl  gaia.hd   gaiapercent.cl  root.hd
  gaia.cl  gaiadispandcut.cl  _gaia.hd     gaia.men  helpdb.mip

 /star/iraf/gaia/doc:
 gaiacut.hlp  gaiadispandcut.hlp  gaiadisp.hlp  gaia.hlp  gaiapercent.hlp

Getting the cl scripts to work is probably straight-forward.
