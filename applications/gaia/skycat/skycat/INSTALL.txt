HOW TO INSTALL the Skycat Package
---------------------------------


1. Before you build Skycat
--------------------------

The skycat package depends on the following packages being already
installed (included in the tarfile, also available from
ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/archive/skycat):

	tclutil  - Tcl and C++ Utilities
	astrotcl - Astronomical utilities for C++ and Tcl
	rtd      - Real-Time Image Display
	cat      - Astronomical Catalog Library

These packages also assume one of the following Tcl environments are
installed:

For Tcl7.6:
	itcl2.2    - [Incr Tcl], includes tcl7.6, tk4.2
	BLT2.1     - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX7.6.0  - Extended Tcl

Or for Tcl8.0 (TclPro-1.2):
	Tcl8.0.5   - Tcl Shell  (*** NOTE: bug in init.tcl, see below)
	Tk8.0.5    - Tk Toolkit
	itcl3.0.1  - [Incr Tcl]
	BLT2.4g    - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX8.0.4  - Extended Tcl

Or for Tcl8.2 (TclPro-1.3):
	Tcl8.2.3   - Tcl Shell
	Tk8.2.3    - Tk Toolkit
	itcl3.1.0  - [Incr Tcl]
	BLT2.4o    - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX8.2.0  - Extended Tcl (*** NOTE: see below for possible problems)

Or for Tcl8.3 (TclPro-1.4):
	Tcl8.3.3   - Tcl Shell
	Tk8.3.3    - Tk Toolkit
	itcl3.2    - [Incr Tcl]
	BLT2.4u    - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX8.3    - Extended Tcl

These packages are available from the TCL archives: 
  http://www.scriptics.com/

You can install the standard Tcl/Tk packages anywhere, however it is
easiest to install them all in the same directory (using the same
-prefix argument to configure).

NOTE: If you are building with Scriptics TclPro, you also need a
"normal" Tcl8.x installation (installed from the source). The Skycat
configure scripts depend on the $prefix/lib/tclConfig.sh and related
files being installed.  These files are not currently part of the
TclPro installation. Also, the names of some of the libraries are
different in TclPro. Skycat uses the "prowrap" application and the
Scriptics libraries to build a single binary version for tcl8.x, if
they are found.

2. Build SKYCAT
---------------

To build the software, type:

	configure
	make 
	make install

The default install dir is /usr/local. You can specify the -prefix
argument to configure to change this:

 	configure -prefix $INSTALLDIR

The compilers used are the same as those used to build the tclutil
package. The file tclutilConfig.sh is read by configure to get the
necessary information.

If you specify the configure option --enable-shared:

	configure -prefix $INSTALLDIR --enable-shared

you can build a shared library and load the Tcl commands with the Tcl
"load" command or load it as a Tcl package under the name "Skycat". 

**********************************************************************
Note: If you want to build a stand-alone binary version of skycat, you
should also build static libraries (.a archives) for all of the required
packages (tclutil, astrotcl, rtd, skycat, itcl, tclx, blt).
**********************************************************************


3 VLT Make Procedure
--------------------

As an alternative to running configure and make, you can also do this:

	cd src
	make 
	make install

The Makefile in the skycat/src directory runs configure and then make as
described above. You can also specify options to that Makefile, for
example:

	cd src
	make PREFIX=$INSTALLDIR CONFIGURE_FLAGS=--with-gcc

The PREFIX variable defaults to /usr/local and is the prefix of the
directory in which to install the software.


4. Running
----------

The skycat application may be started in the following ways:

Interpreted version:
--------------------

The interpreted version, in the source tree:

	% cd skycat/interp/demos
	% skycat
or:
        % skycat myimage.fits  

the interpreted version, installed with prefix = $INSTALLDIR:
	
	% $INSTALLDIR/bin/skycat
 
The single binary version has the OS version appended to the name,
for example skycat-SunOS-5.5.1, and can be found in the following
directories:

  In the source tree:

	skycat/tclpro/bin

  In the install tree:

 	$INSTALLDIR/bin
