# This script is sourced by the skycat startup file, skycat.sh, 
# if present, to set up the environment for running the skycat demo
# from the local source dir. This arranges to have the Tcl/Tk scripts
# and shared libraries searched for in the local source tree rather 
# than in the install dir, which is the default otherwise.
