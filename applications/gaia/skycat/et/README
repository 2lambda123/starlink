****************************************************************
* Note: This release of ET has been modified from the original
* (et80b2) by Allan Brighton (abrighto@eso.org) to make it work
* with itcl2.2 and a few other minor changes.
* The main change was to update the inline version of tk.tcl to
* use the itcl version. For this I added a new source file
* et42i.c. (22 Nov 97)
****************************************************************

This directory contains source code and examples to "ET", the
"Embedded Tk" system for writing C programs that access Tcl/Tk.
A description of this system is contained in the postscript
file "ET.ps", the HTML file "ET.html", and the plain ASCII text
file "ET.txt" all of which are built from "ET.doc" in the "doc"
subdirectory.

To build the ET, the documentation and a subset of the example programs,
enter the following commands from a Bourne-shell:

    ./configure
    make

A couple of the more interesting example programs are not built by this
command since they won't work on all systems.  To build the other
examples, type:

    make linuxstat
    make tkterm

Note that the only required parts of ET are the "et.o" library and the
"et2c" preprocessor.  If any of the example programs fail to build,
that should not prevent you from using the ET system.

Portions of the ET source code are copied from freely copyable, but
copyrighted material (such as the original Tk sources.)  O'Reilly
and Associates will eventually assume the copyright for the "ET.ps"
documentation file.  All other parts of this archive are in the 
public domain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Changes in release 1.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I took the time (finally) to write an autoconf for ET.  Besides that,
little has changed, except for incremental improvements in some of
the example programs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Changed in release 1.6b3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of the 1.6b3 release, ET can be used with Tk4.1 to produce executables
that run under Windows95, Windows3.11 and Windows3.1.  Three of the example
programs have been modified to work under both UNIX and Windows:

    tkedit
    www
    httpd
    
The "Makefile.bc" makefile is included for Borland C++ 4.5.

The "et2c" program sources compile without modification under both UNIX
and Windows.  The "et.o" library, however, had to be changed extensively.
Windows programs should use the "et41win.c" source file instead of the
"et41.c" source file in order to generate the "et.o" library.

The start-up procedures are also different for Windows, due to the fact
that a windows program does not contain a "main()" function.  The et41win.c
library contains no Et_Init() or Et_MainLoop() function calls.  Instead,
the user should insert all initialization code into a special function
named "Et_Main()" which will be called by et41win.c automatically during
setup.  The following is an example:

   void Et_Main(int argc, char **argv){
     /* Put your initialization code here */
   }

   #if UNIX
   int main(int argc, char **argv){
      Et_Init(&argc,argv);
      Et_Main(argc,argv);
      Et_MainLoop();
      return 0;
   #endif

The "et2c" preprocessor has been modified to always define two macros
"UNIX" and "WIN32".  Under non-windows systems, UNIX is set to 1 and
WIN32 is initialized to 0.  Under windows systems, UNIX is 0 and
WIN32 is 1.  Again, both of these macros are defined in every file
preprocessed by "et2c".  There is also a new Tcl/Tk variabled named
"Win32" that is set to 1 under Windows version of ET and 0 under UNIX
versions.

This is the first release of ET for Windows, so there will likely be
problems.  You help in reporting problems to the author is appreciated.
