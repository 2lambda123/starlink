Note: the plain C sources here were taken from the "cfitsio" package
(version: cfitsio2023beta), which was written by William D. Pence
(pence@tetra.gsfc.nasa.gov) of HEASARC, NASA/GSFC.

Any local changes are commented with "allan".

See the URL above for a complete description of the cfitsio library.

I wrote the FitsIO C++ class and then modified it to work with the
cfitsio library. It is a kind of wrapper class, to be used by
other C++ classes to access FITS files, although it does not provide
all of the functionality of the C library.

CHANGES to the original package:
--------------------------------

* Copied the cfitsio sources here and merged relevant parts of the
  configure script into the astrotcl configure script, so that we re
  not dependent on an external library and can build static and/or
  shared versions as required.

* Added support for ESO HIERARCH keywords

* Changed some globals to static in compress.c to avoid conflicts
