Note: the plain C sources here were taken from the "cfitsio" package
(version: cfitsio2027), which was written by William D. Pence
(pence@tetra.gsfc.nasa.gov) of HEASARC, NASA/GSFC.

See the URL above for a complete description of the cfitsio library.

I wrote the FitsIO C++ class and then modified it to work with the
cfitsio library. It is a kind of wrapper class, to be used by
other C++ classes to access FITS files, although it does not provide
all of the functionality of the C library.
