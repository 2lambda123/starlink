This directory contains sources extracted from Tix4.1.0.  They are
(temporarily at least) included here for backward compatibility, so
that existing application Makefiles do not need to be modified to
include Tix. See the Tix package for documentation, examples and
tests.

Note: Copies of the private Tcl/Tk include files are also found here,
since Tix needs them at compile time.
