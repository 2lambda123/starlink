CHANGES to the GAIA plugin
--------------------------

This file contains a list of changes to the GAIA plugin software and
user interface. The latest changes are at the top.

---------------  25.6.98 released gaia_plugin-1.0.6 --------------------------

* StarFItsIO: Fixed a bug that caused a crash (on solaris, at least), when loading
  a FITS file that was read-only. The problem was that, for GAIA, we want to map
  the file read-write+private (copy on write mode). The file is not actually modified, 
  but it needs read-write permission to do it this way (which is the most efficient).
  The fix: If a FITS image file is read-only, a memory copy is now made.

---------------  28.5.98 released gaia_plugin-1.0.5 --------------------------

* class StarFitsIO: added method: byteSwapData(FitsIO*) to swap bytes
  if needed.

* class StarRtdImage: added derived method (derived from
  RtdImage::makeImage(FitsIO*)), so that GAIA features also work when
  the image does not come from a file.  This method is called by Rtd
  methods for such things as blank images, real-time updates, mmap
  images, etc., and is needed mainly to do the byte-swapping and
  initialize WCS using class StarWCS in place of the default SAOWCS.

---------------  13.5.98 released gaia_plugin-1.0.4 --------------------------

* StarWCS.C: replaced with new version supplied by Peter Draper that
  fixes previous problems when CRVAL1 and CRVAL2 are reversed.

---------------  6.5.98 released gaia_plugin-1.0.3 --------------------------

* SkyCat_plugin.tcl: set the NDF_FORMATS_* environment variables correctly
  and append "-file_types $file_types" to the argv list for the application,
  so that the file type menu in the file selection dialog works correctly. 

* gaia/Makefile.in: install autocrop and ardstat in the correct places so
  that they are found in $gaia_library at runtime.

* StarBlink.tcl: fixed the "blink" feature (was a problem with "cloning"...)

---------------  4.5.98 released gaia_plugin-1.0.2 --------------------------

* Remove "Save region as..." from skycat menu, since the operation
  is not supported by the StarFitsIO class (the same functionality
  is found under "Image regions..." anyway).

* Added top level makefile targets to build a binary plugin release.
 
* Skycat_plugin.tcl: added code to check for and set Starlink environment
  variables.

* convert.tcl: new file, sets Starlink/convert environment variables so
  that the user doesn't have to source "convert.csh". 

* Gaia.tcl: import the ::blt namespace (needed for blt::table).

* GaiaImageCtrl.tcl: Fixed "File=>Reopen" to really reload the
  image. This works slightly different than the Skycat version, due to
  the way the image is mapped (with the PRIVATE mmap flag).

---------------  28.4.98 released gaia_plugin-1.0.1 --------------------------

* StarWCS.[Ch]: Fixed xSecPix() and ySecPix() methods and added private
  members to save the values (needed for plotting some catalog symbols).

* configure.in: set FFLAGS to work around g77 bugs on HP and Linux.
  (On HP g77 can crash on some files if you specify -O, on Linux, you
  can get assembler errors for some files if you do not use -O...).

* Added target in top level Makefile to build plugin dir for testing.

* Gaia.tcl: fixed clone method to work with new skycat version.

* Minor change in StarAstTable: 
  Changed AstroCat "cget -image" to "[get_image_name]"

---------------  9.4.98 released gaia_plugin-1.0 -----------------------------

* Tcl library files: Merged in changes, where possible, in the Tcl
  sources that were originally part of Rtd/Skycat and were modified
  for GAIA, and then deleted the GAIA versions. Now there is only one
  copy of each source file, and the GAIA changes are only implemented
  in new classes or subclasses.
  
* Added the GAIA Help window feature to TopLevelWidget (renamed from
  StarHelp to HelpWin).

* StarRtdImage.C: Changed the name of the image type from
  "starrtdimage" to "rtdimage".  This just overrides the original
  implementationso with a derived one, so that no Tcl code changes are
  needed to use the new image type and new features.

* Renamed the modified WCS class to StarWCS and made it a subclass of
  the new abstract WCSRep class, and added code to StarRtdImage.C to
  make sure that the new WCS implementation is used.

* StarRtdImage.C, StarFitsIO: Added class StarFitsIO to replace GAIA
  version of FitsIO and remain compatible with the Skycat version.

* StarRtdImage.C: Use of new Skycat/Rtd features supporting
  subclassing: new constructor args, GAIA_CONFIG macro for Tk config
  options.

* Renamed defineBitmaps() to defineGaiaBitmaps(). 

* Added Gaia_Init routine for the Gaia Tcl package. It calls StarRtd_Init
  and all of the other required Init routines.

* NDFIO.[Ch]: Updated for get() methods, removed static put_keyword,
  blankImage methods (not used).  Changed constructor to initialize
  WCS object.
