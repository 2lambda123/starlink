#  Name:
#     GaiaImageSpectrum

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Extends the RtdImageSpectrum class to add the ability to 
#     save the spectrum to a file. 

#  Description:
#     This class extends RtdImageSpectrum so that the currently 
#     selected line across the line can be extracted and stored
#     as an image. It does this by adding an extra button 
#     to the lower toolbar which initiates a fileselection dialog. 
#     It then uses the foreign image command writeslice to extract the
#     line of data. 

#  Invocations:
#
#        GaiaImageSpectrum object_name [configuration options]
#
#     This creates an instance of a GaiaImageSpectrum object. 
#     The return is the name of the object.
#
#        object_name configure -configuration_options value
#
#     Applies any of the configuration options (after the instance has
#     been created).
#
#        object_name method arguments
#
#     Performs the given method on this object.

#  Methods:
#
#        save_as
#
#     This method creates a fileselection window to get a file name.
#     It then extracts the current line into an image.
#
#        make_buttons
#
#     This method overrides RtdImageSpectrum to create the buttons
#     at the bottom of the display. It adds the "save as..." option.

#  Notes:
#     Originally this routine used the FIGARO application SLICE, but 
#     has been changed to use an internal routine instead. This is
#     because SLICE cannot deal with the situation when axes are
#     monotonically decreasing (which is pretty fundermental
#     when dealing with celestial coordinate systems). SLICE also
#     always insists on using axes values, which hardly ever useful
#     for us.

#  Inheritance:
#     This class inherits the abilities of RtdImageSpectrum.
