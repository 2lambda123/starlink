      SUBROUTINE RTD1_DEWCS( HEAD, NHEAD, IWCS, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     RTD1_DEWCS

*  Purpose:
*     Decodes an WCS system from FITS headers.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL RTD1_DEWCS( HEAD, NHEAD, IWCS, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine processes a FITS header character array, looking for
*     an encoded WCS which it returns as an AST FrameSet (suitable for
*     writing to an NDF component). The headers are scanned using the
*     normal sequence of encoding priorities (so Native, the most
*     accurate, are scanned for first, followed by FITS-WCS).

*  Arguments:
*     HEAD ( NHEAD ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Character array that contains some FITS headers that may
*        contain a WCS system. 
*     NHEAD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of cards in the input header.
*     IWCS = INTEGER (Given)
*        AST identifier to the decoded FrameSet. This is set to
*        AST__NULL if none is found.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

      CHAN = AST_FITSCHAN( AST_NULL, AST_NULL, ' ', STATUS )
      IF ( STATUS .EQ. SAI__OK ) THEN 

*  Now write all the cards to the FITS channel. Clear any errors as
*  these are probably due to trivial formatting mistakes.

               CALL ERR_ANNUL( STATUS )
            END IF
 1       CONTINUE

*  And read the channel for a WCS object.
         CALL AST_CLEAR( CHAN, 'CARD', STATUS )
         IWCS = AST_READ( CHAN, STATUS )


*  NDF insists that FrameSet have a base frame with domain Grid, so 
*  just ensure this (we could check this, but then we'd probably set it
*  to grid anyway, so just do it).
         BASE = AST_GETFRAME( IWCS, AST__BASE, STATUS )
         CALL AST_SET( BASE, 'Domain=Grid', STATUS )
         CALL AST_ANNUL( BASE, STATUS )

*  Release the channel as we are now finished with it.
         CALL AST_ANNUL( CHAN, STATUS )
