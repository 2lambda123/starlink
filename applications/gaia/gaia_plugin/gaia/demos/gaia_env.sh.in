# This script is sourced by the gaia startup file, gaia.sh, 
# if present, to set up the environment for running the gaia demo
# from the local source dir. This arranges to have the Tcl/Tk scripts
# and shared libraries searched for in the local source tree rather 
# than in the install dir, which is the default otherwise.
