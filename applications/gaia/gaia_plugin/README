Gaia_plugin Package
-------------------

This directory contains the sources for the GAIA plugin, which adds a
WCS grid and many photometry related features to Skycat.  The original
GAIA is a standalone application, developed by Peter W. Draper
(P.W.Draper@durham.ac.uk) that is based on Skycat, Rtd and Starlink.
This is a modified version of GAIA that has been merged with a newer
version of Skycat. It can be compiled as a standalone application or
loaded dynamically as a Tcl package in a running Skycat application.

This package requires the following packages to be already installed:

* Skycat (version 2.0.11 or newer)

* Starlink (special version for GAIA - requires FORTRAN compiler (g77))

In addition, the following packages may be required at run-time:

* Starlink/convert  - convert between FITS and NDF image formats

* pbmplus  - portable bitmap utilities (v. 10dec91), required by
             Starlink/convert. If you have this package, you can use
             GAIA/Skycat to view images in other formats, such as GIF...

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL in this directory.

See the CHANGES file in this directory for a list of recent changes.
