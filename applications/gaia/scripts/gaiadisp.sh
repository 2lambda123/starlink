#   Name:
#      gaiadisp
#
#   Purpose:
#      Display images in a GAIA tool.
#
#   Usage:
#         gaiadisp image
#      or
#         gaiadisp image clone_number
#      or
#         gaiadisp image1 image2 image3 ...
#
#   Description:
#      This command displays images in GAIA. It has two basic modes
#      display a single image into a specified "clone", or display
#      a list of images into a series of automatically created clones.
#
#      Clones are specified by an integer number less than 1000.
#      The special number -1 indicates that a number should be generated.

#      25-NOV-1996 (PWD):
#         Original version.
#      09-MAR-1998 (PWD):
#         Now uses the remote control interface, rather than send
#         mechanism (less X security complaints).
#      18-MAY-1999 (PWD):
#         Converted to use GAIA single binary gaia_stcl.
#      15-APR-2004 (PWD):
#         Merged with the gaiadispmany script that was never released.
