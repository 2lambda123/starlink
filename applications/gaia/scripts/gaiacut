#   Name:
#      gaiacut

#   Purpose:
#      Apply intensity cuts to GAIA

#   Usage:
#      gaiacut clone_number lowcut|percentile [highcut]

#   Description:
#      Applies a given intensity cut to a displayed image in GAIA.
#      If two values are given then these are interpreted as simple
#      intensity limits, otherwise a single "percentile" cut is
#      applied.
#
#      Clones are specified by an integer numbers from 1 upwards.
