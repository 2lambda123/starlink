#   Name:
#      gaiacmap

#   Purpose:
#      Set colormap for use in GAIA.

#   Usage:
#         gaiacmap cmap_file

#   Description:
#      Allows the colour map used by GAIA to be changed to use
#      an external file. The external file must be a simple text
#      file with three space separated columns. The columns give
#      the relative intensities of the red, green and blue channels.

#   Notes:
#      To convert a KAPPA LUT for use in GAIA you can do the following:
#
#      % convert
#      % ndf2ascii fixed=true noperec=3 in=$KAPPA_DIR/zebra_lut out=zebra_lut.lasc
#
#      The file "zebra_lut.lasc" can now be loaded by this script. Note that
#      an "lasc" file must have 256 rows, so you will need to scale or pad
#      luts with less or more rows.
