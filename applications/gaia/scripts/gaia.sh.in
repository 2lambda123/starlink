#  History:
#     21-NOV-1996 (PWD):
#        Original version.
#     17-MAY-1999 (PWD):
#        Now starts up single binary version of GAIA.
#     23-SEP-2004 (PWD):
#        Added CYGWIN environment variable.
#     04-OCT-2006 (PWD):
#        Make sure installation lib directories are first on the library
#        path. Now that we have shareable libraries for Tcl/Tk this is
#        safer.
#     08-MAY-2007 (PWD):
#        Updated for Skycat 3.0.1. Now works without GAIA_DIR pre-defined
#        and doesn't need to be wrapped by a C-shell script to initialise
#        CONVERT.
