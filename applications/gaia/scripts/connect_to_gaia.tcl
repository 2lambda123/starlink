#   Name:
#     connect_to_gaia
#
#   Purpose:
#     Attach to an existing GAIA or start a new instance.
#
#   Usage:
#     lassign [connect_to_gaia] gaia_fd connected
#
#   Description:
#     A procedure that tries to connect to an existing GAIA by connecting
#     to the remote socket interface. If that fails a new instance of GAIA
#     will be started. The return is a file descriptor to the socket, this
#     can be used to send "remotetcl" commands, and a flag indicating if a
#     new instance of GAIA was started.
#     
#     To detach from GAIA just close the given file descriptor.
#
#     To send to GAIA see the simple "send_to_gaia" proc also included,
#     and to make queries about the GAIA basic components "get_gaia_parts".
