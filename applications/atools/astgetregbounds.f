      SUBROUTINE ASTGETREGBOUNDS( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTGETREGBOUNDS

*  Purpose:
*     Returns the bounding box of Region.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTGETREGBOUNDS( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application returns the upper and lower limits of a box which
*     just encompasses the supplied Region. The limits are returned as axis
*     values within the Frame represented by the Region. The value of the
*     Negated  attribute is ignored (i.e. it is assumed that the Region has not
*     been negated).

*     The corresponding AST function is AST_GETREGIONBOUDS, but the name
*     has been contracted to "astgetregbounds" for the purposes of this
*     ATOOLS command in order not to exceed the allowed length of HDS
*     component names.

*  Usage:
*     ast_getregbounds this

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     LBND() = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        An array in which to return the lower axis bounds covered by the
*        Region. It should have at least as many elements as there are axes
*        in the Region. If an axis has no lower limit, the returned value
*        will be the largest possible negative value.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file holding the Region.
*     UBND() = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        An array in which to return the upper axis bounds covered by the
*        Region. It should have at least as many elements as there are axes
*        in the Region. If an axis has no upper limit, the returned value
*        will be the largest possible positive value.
