      SUBROUTINE ASTADDVARIANT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTADDVARIANT

*  Purpose:
*     Store a new variant Mapping for the current Frame in a FrameSet.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTADDVARIANT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application allows a new variant Mapping to be stored with the
*     current Frame in a FrameSet. See the "Variant" attribute for more
*     details. It can also be used to rename the currently selected variant
*     Mapping.

*  Usage:
*     astaddvariant this map name result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     MAP = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Mapping which describes how to
*        convert coordinates from the current Frame to the new variant of
*        the current Frame. If null (!) is supplied, then the name
*        associated with the currently selected variant of the current
*        Frame is set to the value supplied for NAME, but no new variant
*        is added. If an NDF is supplied, the Mapping from the Base
*        Frame to the Current Frame of its WCS FrameSet will be used.
*     NAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name to associate with the new variant Mapping (or the
*        currently selected variant Mapping if a null value is supplied
*        for MAP).
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file to receive the modified FrameSet. If an NDF
*        is supplied, the WCS FrameSet within the NDF will be replaced by
*        the new FrameSet, if possible.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the original FrameSet to which a
*        new variant Mapping is to be added. If an NDF is supplied, the WCS
*        FrameSet will be used.

*  Notes:
*     - The newly added Variant becomes the current variant on exit (this
*     is equivalent to setting the Variant attribute to the value supplied
*     for NAME).
*     - An error is reported if a variant with the supplied name already
*     exists in the current Frame.
