      SUBROUTINE FRAME( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     FRAME

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Frame.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL FRAME( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new Frame and optionally initialises its
*     attributes. A Frame is used to represent a coordinate system. It does
*     this in rather the same way that a frame around a graph describes the 
*     coordinate space in which data are plotted. Consequently, a Frame has 
*     a Title (string) attribute, which describes the coordinate space, and 
*     contains axes which in turn hold information such as Label and Units 
*     strings which are used for labelling (e.g.) graphical output. In
*     general, however, the number of axes is not restricted to two. 

*  Usage:
*     frame naxes options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     NAXES = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of Frame axes (i.e. the number of dimensions of the
*        coordinate space which the Frame describes). 
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute 
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new Frame. 
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new Frame.
