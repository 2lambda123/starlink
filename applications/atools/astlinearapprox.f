      SUBROUTINE ASTLINEARAPPROX( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTLINEARAPPROX

*  Purpose:
*     Find a linear approximation to a mapping

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTLINEARAPPROX( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application allows you to find a linear approximation
*     to a mapping over a region in the base coordinates. A typical use
*     might be to calculate the orientation and scale of an image after
*     being transformed by a Mapping.

*  Usage:
*     astlinearapprox this lbndin ubndin fit

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FIT() = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        An array returning the co-efficients of the linear approximation
*        to the specified transformation. The first Nout elements hold
*        the constant offsets for the transformation outputs. The remaining
*        elements hold the gradients. So if the Mapping has 2 inputs and 2
*        outputs the linear approximation to the forward transformation is:
*
*           X_out = fit[0] + fit[2]*X_in + fit[3]*Y_in
*           Y_out = fit[1] + fit[4]*X_in + fit[5]*Y_in
*
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Mapping. If an NDF is supplied,
*        the Mapping from the base Frame of the WCS FrameSet to the
*        current Frame will be used.
*     LBNDIN() = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        An array with one element for each Mapping input coordinate. This
*        should contain the lower bound of the input region in each input
*        dimension. If an NDF was supplied for THIS and FORWARD is true, then
*        a null (!) value can be supplied in which case a default will be used
*        corresponding to the GRID cordinates of the bottom left corner of the
*        bottom left pixel in the NDF (i.e. a value of 0.5 on every grid axis).
*     UBNDIN() = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        An array with one element for each Mapping input coordinate. This
*        should contain the upper bound of the input region in each input
*        dimension. Note that it is permissible for the upper bound to be
*        less than the corresponding lower bound, as the values will simply
*        be swapped before use. If an NDF was supplied for THIS and FORWARD is
*        true, then a null (!) value can be supplied in which case a default
*        will be used corresponding to the GRID cordinates of the top right
*        corner of the top right pixel in the NDF (i.e. a value of (DIM+0.5)
*        on every grid axis, where DIM is the number of pixels along the axis).
*     TOL = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The maximum permitted deviation from linearity, expressed as a
*        positive Cartesian displacement in the output coordinate space of
*        the Mapping. If a linear fit to the forward transformation of the
*        Mapping deviates from the true transformation by more than this
*        amount at any point which is tested, then no fit coefficients will
*        be returned.
