      SUBROUTINE ASTOVERLAP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTOVERLAP

*  Purpose:
*     Test if two regions overlap each other.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTOVERLAP( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application determines if the two supplied Regions overlap. The 
*     two Regions are converted to a commnon coordinate system before 
*     performing the check. If this conversion is not possible (for instance 
*     because the two Regions represent areas in different domains), then 
*     the check cannot be performed.

*  Usage:
*     astoverlap this that

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the first region. If an NDF is 
*        supplied, the current Frame in the WCS FrameSet will be used. 
*     THAT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the second region. If an NDF is 
*        supplied, the current Frame in the WCS FrameSet will be used. 
*     RESULT = _INTEGER (Write)
*        On exit, this holds an integer indicating if there is any overlap
*        between the two Regions. Possible values are:
*
*        0 - The check could not be performed because the second Region
*            could not be mapped into the coordinate system of the first
*            Region.
*
*        1 - There is no overlap between the two Regions.
*
*        2 - The first Region is completely inside the second Region.
*
*        3 - The second Region is completely inside the first Region.
*
*        4 - There is partial overlap between the two Regions.
*
*        5 - The Regions are identical to within their uncertainties.
*
*        6 - The second Region is the exact negation of the first Region
*            to within their uncertainties.
