      SUBROUTINE ASTDISTANCE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTDISTANCE

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate the distance between two points in a Frame

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTDISTANCE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application finds the distance between two points whose Frame
*     coordinates are given. The distance calculated is that along
*     the geodesic curve that joins the two points. The distance is
*     displayed on the screen ("<bad>" is displayed if the distance
*     cannot be calculated).
*
*     For example, in a basic Frame, the distance calculated will be
*     the Cartesian distance along the straight line joining the two
*     points. For a more specialised Frame describing a sky coordinate
*     system, however, it would be the distance along the great circle
*     passing through two sky positions.

*  Usage:
*     astdistance this point1 point2

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF, FITS file or text file holding the Frame. If an NDF is
*        supplied, the current Frame of the WCS FrameSet will be used. If a
*        FITS file is supplied, the Frame corresponding to the primary axis
*        descriptions will be used.
*     POINT1() = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        An array with one element for each Frame axis (Naxes attribute)
*        containing the coordinates of the first point.
*     POINT2() = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        An array with one element for each Frame axis (Naxes attribute)
*        containing the coordinates of the second point.
