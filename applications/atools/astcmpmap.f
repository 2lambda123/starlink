      SUBROUTINE ASTCMPMAP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTCMPMAP

*  Purpose:
*     Create a CmpMap.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTCMPMAP( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new CmpMap and optionally initialises its 
*     attributes. A CmpMap is a compound Mapping which allows two component 
*     Mappings (of any class) to be connected together to form a more complex 
*     Mapping. This connection may either be "in series" (where the first 
*     Mapping is used to transform the coordinates of each point and the
*     second mapping is then applied to the result), or "in parallel" where
*     one Mapping transforms the earlier coordinates for each point and the 
*     second Mapping simultaneously transforms the later coordinates). 
*
*     Since a CmpMap is itself a Mapping, it can be used as a component in
*     forming further CmpMaps. Mappings of arbitrary complexity may be built 
*     from simple individual Mappings in this way. 

*  Usage:
*     astcmpmap map1 map2 series options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     MAP1 = LITERAL (Read) 
*        An NDF or text file holding the first component Mapping If an NDF 
*        is supplied, the Mapping from the Base Frame to the Current Frame 
*        of its WCS FrameSet will be used.
*     MAP2 = LITERAL (Read) 
*        An NDF or text file holding the second component Mapping If an NDF 
*        is supplied, the Mapping from the Base Frame to the Current Frame 
*        of its WCS FrameSet will be used.
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute 
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new CmpMap. 
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new CmpMap.
*     SERIES = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a true value is given for this parameter, the two component
*        Mappings will be connected in series. A false value requests that 
*        they are connected in parallel.
