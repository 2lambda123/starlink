      SUBROUTINE ASTCMPREGION( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTCMPREGION

*  Purpose:
*     Create a CmpRegion.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTCMPREGION( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new CmpMap and optionally initialises
*     its attributes. A CmpRegion is a Region which allows two component
*     Regions (of any class) to be combined to form a more complex
*     Region. This combination may be performed a boolean AND, OR
*     or XOR (exclusive OR) operator. If the AND operator is
*     used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion only if it is
*     inside both of its two component Regions. If the OR operator is
*     used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion if it is inside
*     either (or both) of its two component Regions. If the XOR operator
*     is used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion if it is inside
*     one but not both of its two component Regions. Other operators can
*     be formed by negating one or both component Regions before using
*     them to construct a new CmpRegion.
*
*     The two component Region need not refer to the same coordinate
*     Frame, but it must be possible for the AST_CONVERT
*     function to determine a Mapping between them (an error will be
*     reported otherwise when the CmpRegion is created). For instance,
*     a CmpRegion may combine a Region defined within an ICRS SkyFrame
*     with a Region defined within a Galactic SkyFrame. This is
*     acceptable because the SkyFrame class knows how to convert between
*     these two systems, and consequently the AST_CONVERT
*     function will also be able to convert between them. In such cases,
*     the second component Region will be mapped into the coordinate Frame
*     of the first component Region, and the Frame represented by the
*     CmpRegion as a whole will be the Frame of the first component Region.
*
*     Since a CmpRegion is itself a Region, it can be used as a
*     component in forming further CmpRegions. Regions of arbitrary
*     complexity may be built from simple individual Regions in this
*     way.

*  Usage:
*     astcmpregion region1 region2 oper options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     OPER = LITERAL (Read)
*        The boolean operator with which to combine the two Regions. This
*        must be one of "AND", "OR" or "XOR".
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new CmpMap.
*     REGION1 = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file holding the first component Region.
*     REGION2 = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file holding the second component Region.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new CmpMap.
