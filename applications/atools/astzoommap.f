      SUBROUTINE ASTZOOMMAP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTZOOMMAP

*  Purpose:
*     Create a ZoomMap.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTZOOMMAP( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new ZoomMap and optionally initialises
*     its attributes. A ZoomMap is a linear Mapping which performs a "zoom"
*     transformation by multiplying all coordinate values by the same
*     scale factor (the inverse transformation is performed by
*     dividing by this scale factor). The number of coordinate values
*     representing each point is unchanged.

*  Usage:
*     astzoommap ncoord zoom options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     NCOORD = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of coordinate values for the ZoomMap (the same value
*        is used for both input and output axes).
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new ZoomMap.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new ZoomMap.
*     ZOOM = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        Initial scale factor by which coordinate values should be
*        multiplied (by the forward transformation) or divided (by the
*        inverse transformation). This factor may subsequently be
*        changed via the ZoomMap's Zoom attribute. It may be positive
*        or negative, but should not be zero.
