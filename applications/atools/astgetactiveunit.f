      SUBROUTINE ASTGETACTIVEUNIT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTGETACTUNIT

*  Purpose:
*     Get the value of the ActiveUnit flag for a rame.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTGETACTIVEUNIT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application displays the current value of the ActiveUnit flag for
*     a Frame (see the description of the ASTSETACTIVEUNIT command for a 
*     description of the ActiveUnit flag). The value of the flag is also 
*     written to an output parameter.

*  Usage:
*     astgetactunit this 

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Frame. If an NDF is supplied, 
*        the WCS FrameSet will be used.
*     VALUE = _LOGICAL (Write)
*        On exit, this holds a boolean value indicating if the ActiveUnit
*        flag was set or not.

*  Notes:
*     - This application corresponds to the AST routine AST_GETACTIVEUNIT. 
*     The name has been abbreviated due to a limitation on the length of 
*     ADAM command names.
