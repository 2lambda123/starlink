      SUBROUTINE ASTTRANGRID( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTTRANGRID

*  Purpose:
*     Transform a grid of positions

*  Language:
*     Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTTRANGRID( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application uses a supplied Mapping to transforms the
*     pixel coordinates at the centre of every pixel in a grid with
*     specified pixel index bounds. The resulting coordinate values are
*     stored in an output NDF with the same pixel bounds. This output NDF
*     has an extra trailing pixel axis that enumerates the outputs from
*     the Mapping. This extra axis has pixel index bounds "1:Nout", where
*     "Nout" is the number of axis values produced by the supplied Mapping.

*     Efficiency is improved by first approximating the Mapping with a linear
*     transformation applied over the whole region of the input grid which
*     is being used. If this proves to be insufficiently accurate, the
*     input region is sub-divided into two along its largest dimension and
*     the process is repeated within each of the resulting sub-regions.
*     This process of sub-division continues until a sufficiently good
*     linear approximation is found, or the region to which it is being
*     applied becomes too small (in which case the original Mapping is
*     used directly).

*  Usage:
*     asttrangrid this lbnd ubnd tol maxpix forward result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     LBND() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of the output NDF. The number of
*        values supplied should equal the Nin attribute of the supplied
*        Mapping.
*     FORWARD = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        A TRUE value indicates that the Mapping's forward coordinate
*        transformation is to be applied, while a FALSE value indicates
*        that the inverse transformation should be used. [TRUE]
*     MAXPIX = _INTEGER (Read)
*        A value which specifies an initial scale size (in input grid
*        points) for the adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear
*        Mappings with piece-wise linear transformations. Normally, this
*        should be a large value (larger than any dimension of the region
*        of the input grid being used). In this case, a first attempt to
*        approximate the Mapping by a linear transformation will be made
*        over the entire input region.
*
*        If a smaller value is used, the input region will first be divided
*        into sub-regions whose size does not exceed "maxpix" grid points
*        in any dimension. Only at this point will attempts at
*        approximation commence.
*
*        This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false
*        convergence of the adaptive algorithm in cases where the Mapping
*        appears approximately linear on large scales, but has
*        irregularities (e.g. holes) on smaller scales. A value of, say, 50
*        to 100 grid points can also be employed as a safeguard in
*        general-purpose software, since the effect on performance is
*        minimal.
*
*        If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of
*        inhibiting linear approximation altogether (equivalent to setting
*        "tol" to zero). Although this may degrade performance, accurate
*        results will still be obtained. [100]
*     RESULT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF. This will have "Nin+1" pixel axes, where "Nin"
*        is the number of inputs for the supplied Mapping. The extra
*        pixel axis in the output NDF will have bounds "1:Nout", where
*        "Nout" is the number of outputs for the supplied Mapping. The
*        bounds on the first Nin axes of the output NDF are given by LBND
*        and UBND.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Mapping. If an NDF is supplied,
*        the Mapping from the base Frame of the WCS FrameSet to the
*        current Frame will be used. The inputs of this Mapping
*        correspond to pixel coordinates within the output NDF.
*     TOL = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may be
*        introduced as a result of approximating non-linear Mappings by a
*        set of piece-wise linear transformations. This should be
*        expressed as a displacement within the output coordinate system
*        of the Mapping.
*
*        If piece-wise linear approximation is not required, a value of zero
*        may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is used without any
*        approximation, but may increase execution time.
*
*        If the value is too high, discontinuities between the linear
*        approximations used in adjacent panel will be higher. If this is a
*        problem, reduce the tolerance value used. [0.0]
*     UBND() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of the output NDF. The number of
*        values supplied should equal the Nin attribute of the supplied
*        Mapping.

*  Notes:
*     - The supplied Mapping inputs correspond to pixel coordinates in
*     the grid. Particularly, this means that integer values are located
*     at pixel corners. But astTranGrid assumes an input coordinate system
*     in which integer values are located at pixel centres. Therefore,
*     the supplied Mapping is modified before passing it to astTranGrid.
*     This modification consists of prepending a Shiftmap that shifts each
*     input axis value by -0.5.
