      SUBROUTINE ASTPOLYGON( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTPOLYGON

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Polygon.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTPOLYGON( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new Polygon and optionally initialises
*     its attributes. The Polygon class implements a polygonal area, defined
*     by a collection of vertices, within a 2-dimensional Frame. The vertices
*     are connected together by geodesic curves within the encapsulated Frame.
*     For instance, if the encapsulated Frame is a simple Frame then the
*     geodesics will be straight lines, but if the Frame is a SkyFrame then
*     the geodesics will be great circles.

*  Usage:
*     astpolygon frame xin yin unc options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Frame in which the region is defined.
*        It must have exactly 2 axes. If an NDF is supplied, the current Frame
*        in its WCS FrameSet will be used.
*     XIN = GROUP (Read)
*        A comma-separated list of floating point values to be used as the X
*        axis value of the vertices. A text file may be specified by
*        preceeding the name of the file with an up arrow character "^". If
*        the supplied value ends with a minus sign, the user is re-prompted
*        for additional values.
*     YIN = GROUP (Read)
*        A comma-separated list of floating point values to be used as the Y
*        axis value of the vertices. A text file may be specified by
*        preceeding the name of the file with an up arrow character "^". If
*        the supplied value ends with a minus sign, the user is re-prompted
*        for additional values.
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new Polygon.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An text file to receive the new Polygon.
*     UNC = LITERAL (Read)
*        An optional text file containing an existing Region which
*        specifies the uncertainties associated with each point on the
*        boundary of the Polygon being created. The uncertainty at any
*        point on the Polygon is found by shifting the supplied
*        "uncertainty" Region so that it is centred at the point being
*        considered. The area covered by the shifted uncertainty Region
*        then represents the uncertainty in the position. The uncertainty
*        is assumed to be the same for all points.
*
*        If supplied, the uncertainty Region must be either a Box, a Circle
*        or an Ellipse. Alternatively, a null value (!) may be supplied, in
*        which case a default uncertainty is used equivalent to a box
*        1.0E-6 of the size of the bounding box of the Polygon being created.
*
*        The uncertainty Region has two uses: 1) when the astOverlap
*        function compares two Regions for equality the uncertainty
*        Region is used to determine the tolerance on the comparison, and 2)
*        when a Region is mapped into a different coordinate system and
*        subsequently simplified (using astSimplify), the uncertainties are
*        used to determine if the transformed boundary can be accurately
*        represented by a specific shape of Region.
