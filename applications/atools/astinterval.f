      SUBROUTINE ASTINTERVAL( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTINTERVAL

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Interval.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTINTERVAL( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new Interval and optionally initialises
*     its attributes. 
*
*     The Interval class implements a Region which represents upper
*     and/or lower limits on one or more axes of a Frame. For a point to
*     be within the region represented by the Interval, the point must
*     satisfy all the restrictions placed on all the axes. The point is
*     outside the region if it fails to satisfy any one of the restrictions.
*     Each axis may have either an upper limit, a lower limit, both or
*     neither. If both limits are supplied but are in reverse order (so
*     that the lower limit is greater than the upper limit), then the
*     interval is an excluded interval, rather than an included interval.

*  Usage:
*     astinterval frame lbnd ubnd unc options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read) 
*        An NDF or text file holding the Frame in which the region is defined.
*        It must have exactly 2 axes. If an NDF is supplied, the current Frame 
*        in its WCS FrameSet will be used.
*     LBND = GROUP (Read)
*        A comma-separated list of floating point values to be used as the 
*        lower limits on each axis. Set a value to "AST__BAD" to indicate that 
*        the axis has no lower limit. There should be one element for each Frame 
*        axis.
*     UBND = GROUP (Read)
*        A comma-separated list of floating point values to be used as the 
*        upper limits on each axis. Set a value to "AST__BAD" to indicate that 
*        the axis has no upper limit. There should be one element for each Frame 
*        axis.
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute 
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new Interval. 
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An text file to receive the new Interval. 
*     UNC = LITERAL (Read) 
*        An optional text file containing an existing Region which
*        specifies the uncertainties associated with each point on the
*        boundary of the Interval being created. The uncertainty at any
*        point on the Interval is found by shifting the supplied
*        "uncertainty" Region so that it is centred at the point being
*        considered. The area covered by the shifted uncertainty Region
*        then represents the uncertainty in the position. The uncertainty
*        is assumed to be the same for all points.
*
*        If supplied, the uncertainty Region must be either a Box, a Circle
*        or an Ellipse. Alternatively, a null value (!) may be supplied, in 
*        which case a default uncertainty is used equivalent to a box 
*        1.0E-6 of the size of the bounding box of the Interval being created.
*
*        The uncertainty Region has two uses: 1) when the astOverlap
*        function compares two Regions for equality the uncertainty
*        Region is used to determine the tolerance on the comparison, and 2)
*        when a Region is mapped into a different coordinate system and
*        subsequently simplified (using astSimplify), the uncertainties are 
*        used to determine if the transformed boundary can be accurately 
*        represented by a specific shape of Region.
