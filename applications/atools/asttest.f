      SUBROUTINE ASTTEST( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTTEST

*  Purpose:
*     Test if an Object attribute value is set.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTTEST( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application displays a logical value indicating whether a
*     value has been explicitly set for one of an Object's attributes.
*     This logical value is also written to an output parameter.

*  Usage:
*     asttest this attrib

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ATTRIB = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing the name of the attribute.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Object. If an NDF is supplied,
*        the WCS FrameSet will be used.
*     VALUE = _LOGICAL (Write)
*        On exit, this holds a boolean value indicating if the attribute
*        was set or not.
