      SUBROUTINE ASTSHOWMESH( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTSHOWMESH

*  Purpose:
*     Display a mesh of points covering the surface of a Region.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTSHOWMESH( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application writes a table to standard output containing the axis
*     values at a mesh of points covering the surface of the supplied Region.
*     Each row of output contains a tab-separated list of axis values, one
*     for each axis in the Frame encapsulated by the Region. The number of
*     points in the mesh is determined by the MeshSize attribute.
*
*     The table is preceeded by a given title string, and followed by a
*     single line containing the word "ENDMESH".

*  Usage:
*     astshowmesh this format ttl

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF, FITS file or text file holding the Frame. If an NDF is
*        supplied, the current Frame of the WCS FrameSet will be used. If a
*        FITS file is supplied, the Frame corresponding to the primary axis
*        descriptions will be used.
*     FORMAT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*         If TRUE, then the output table contains axis values that have
*         been formatted using thew AST_FORMAT method. Otherwise, the
*         table contains floating point values displayed with a default format.
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text string to display before the table.
