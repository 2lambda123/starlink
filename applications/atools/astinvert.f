      SUBROUTINE ASTINVERT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTINVERT

*  Purpose:
*     Invert a Mapping.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTINVERT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application inverts a Mapping. If a FrameSet is supplied, the
*     Base and Current Frames will be swapped.

*  Usage:
*     astinvert this result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An text file to receive the inverted Mapping.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Mapping. If an NDF is supplied,
*        the Mapping from the base Frame of the WCS FrameSet to the
*        current Frame will be used.
