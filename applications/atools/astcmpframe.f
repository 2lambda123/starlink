      SUBROUTINE ASTCMPFRAME( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTCMPFRAME

*  Purpose:
*     Create a CmpFrame.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTCMPFRAME( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new CmpFrame and optionally initialises
*     its attributes. A CmpFrame is a compound Frame which allows two
*     component Frames (of any class) to be merged together to form a
*     more complex Frame. The axes of the two component Frames then
*     appear together in the resulting CmpFrame (those of the first Frame,
*     followed by those of the second Frame).
*
*     Since a CmpFrame is itself a Frame, it can be used as a component in
*     forming further CmpFrames. Frames of arbitrary complexity may be
*     built from simple individual Frames in this way.

*  Usage:
*     astcmpframe frame1 frame2 options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     FRAME1 = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the first component Frame. If an NDF
*        is supplied, the current Frame in its WCS FrameSet will be used.
*     FRAME2 = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the second component Frame. If an NDF
*        is supplied, the current Frame in its WCS FrameSet will be used.
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new CmpFrame.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new CmpFrame.
