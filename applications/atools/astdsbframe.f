      SUBROUTINE ASTDSBFRAME( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTDSBFRAME

*  Purpose:
*     Create a DSBSpecFrame.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTDSBFRAME( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new DSBSpecFrame and optionally initialises
*     its attributes. A DSBSpecFrame is a specialised form of SpecFrame which
*     represents positions in a spectrum obtained using a dual sideband
*     instrument. Such an instrument produces a spectrum in which each point
*     contains contributions from two distinctly different frequencies, one
*     from the "lower side band" (LSB) and one from the "upper side band"
*     (USB). Corresponding LSB and USB frequencies are connected by the fact
*     that they are an equal distance on either side of a fixed central
*     frequency known as the "Local Oscillator" (LO) frequency.
*
*     When quoting a position within such a spectrum, it is necessary to
*     indicate whether the quoted position is the USB position or the
*     corresponding LSB position. The SideBand attribute provides this
*     indication.
*
*     In practice, the LO frequency is specified by giving the distance
*     from the LO frequency to some "central" spectral position. Typically
*     this central position is that of some interesting spectral feature.
*     The distance from this central position to the LO frequency is known
*     as the "intermediate frequency" (IF). The value supplied for IF can
*     be a signed value in order to indicate whether the LO frequency is
*     above of below the central position.

*  Usage:
*     astdsbframe options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new DSBSpecFrame.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new DSBSpecFrame.
