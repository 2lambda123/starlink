      SUBROUTINE ASTPERMAXES( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTPERMAXES

*  Purpose:
*     Permute the axis order in a Frame.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTPERMAXES( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application permutes the order in which a Frame's axes occur.

*  Usage:
*     astpermaxes this perm result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     PERM() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        An array with one element for each axis of the Frame given
*        by parameter THIS. This should list the axes in their new order,
*        using the original axis numbering (which starts at 1 for the
*        first axis).
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An text file or NDF to receive the modified Frame or FrameSet.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the original FrameSet to which a
*        new Frame is to be added. If an NDF is supplied, the current
*        Frame of the WCS FrameSet will be used.

*  Notes:
*     - If a FrameSet is supplied for THIS, then the axes of the current
*     Frame will be permuted according to PERM, and all Mappings which
*     connect to the current Frame will be modified to take account of
*     the permutation.
