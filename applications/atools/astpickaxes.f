      SUBROUTINE ASTPICKAXES( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTPICKAXES

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new Frame by picking axes from an existing one.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTPICKAXES( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new Frame whose axes are copied from an
*     existing Frame along with other Frame attributes, such as its
*     Title. Any number (zero or more) of the original Frame's axes
*     may be copied, in any order, and additional axes with default
*     attributes may also be included in the new Frame.
*
*     A Mapping that converts between the coordinate systems described 
*     by the two Frames may also be created.

*  Usage:
*     astpickaxes this axes map result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AXES() = _INTEGER (Read) 
*        A vector of integers which lists the axes to be copied. These 
*        should be given in the order required in the new Frame, using 
*        the axis numbering in the original Frame (which starts at 1 
*        for the first axis). Axes may be selected in any order, but 
*        each may only be used once.  If additional (default) axes are 
*        also to be included, the corresponding elements of this array 
*        should be set to zero.
*     MAP = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive a new Mapping. This will be a PermMap 
*        (or a UnitMap as a special case) that describes the axis 
*        permutation that has taken place between the original and new 
*        Frames. The Mapping's forward transformation will convert 
*        coordinates from the original Frame into the new one, and vice 
*        versa. If this Mapping is not required, a null (!) value may be 
*        supplied for this parameter. [!]
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new Frame. 
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the original FrameSet to which a 
*        new Frame is to be added. If an NDF is supplied, the current 
*        Frame of the WCS FrameSet will be used.
