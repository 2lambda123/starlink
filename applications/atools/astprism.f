      SUBROUTINE ASTPRISM( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTPRISM

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Prism.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTPRISM( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new Prism and optionally initialises
*     its attributes.
*
*     A Prism is a Region that represents an extrusion of an existing Region
*     into one or more orthogonal dimensions (specified by another Region).
*     If the Region to be extruded has N axes, and the Region defining the
*     extrusion has M axes, then the resulting Prism will have (M+N) axes.
*     A point is inside the Prism if the first N axis values correspond to
*     a point inside the Region being extruded, and the remaining M axis
*     values correspond to a point inside the Region defining the extrusion.
*
*     As an example, a cylinder can be represented by extruding an existing
*     Circle, using an Interval to define the extrusion. Ih this case, the
*     Interval would have a single axis and would specify the upper and
*     lower limits of the cylinder along its length.

*  Usage:
*     astprism region1 region2 options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new Prism.
*     REGION1 = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file holding the Region to be extruded.
*     REGION2 = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file holding the Region defining the extent of the extrusion.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new Prism.
