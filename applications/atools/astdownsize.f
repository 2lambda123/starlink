      SUBROUTINE ASTDOWNSIZE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTDOWNSIZE

*  Purpose:
*     Reduce the number of vertices in a Polygon.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTDOWNSIZE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application returns a pointer to a new Polygon that contains
*     a subset of the vertices in the supplied Polygon. The subset is
*     chosen so that the returned Polygon is a good approximation to
*     the supplied Polygon, within the limits specified by the supplied
*     parameter values. That is, the density of points in the returned
*     Polygon is greater at points where the curvature of the boundary
*     of the supplied Polygon is greater.

*  Usage:
*     astdownsize this maxerr maxvert result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     MAXERR = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The maximum allowed discrepancy between the supplied and
*        returned Polygons, expressed as a geodesic distance within the
*        Polygon's coordinate frame. If this is zero or less, the
*        returned Polygon will have the number of vertices specified by
*        MAXVERT.
*     MAXVERT = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The maximum allowed number of vertices in the returned Polygon.
*        If this is less than 3, the number of vertices in the returned
*        Polygon will be the minimum needed to achieve the maximum
*        discrepancy specified by
*        MAXERR.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the modified Polygon.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Mapping. If an NDF is supplied,
*        the current Frame in the WCS FrameSet will be used.
