      SUBROUTINE ASTGETUNC( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTGETUNC

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain uncertainty information from a Region.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTGETUNC( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application returns a Region which represents the uncertainty
*     associated with positions within the supplied Region. See astSetUnc
*     for more information about Region uncertainties and their use.

*  Usage:
*     astgetunc this def result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEF = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Controls what is returned if no uncertainty information has been
*        associated explicitly with the supplied Region. If a TRUE value
*        is supplied, then the default uncertainty Region used internally
*        within AST is returned. If FALSE is supplied, then an error is
*        reported. [TRUE]
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file to receive the new Region describing the
*        uncertainty in the supplied Region.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file holding the Region.
