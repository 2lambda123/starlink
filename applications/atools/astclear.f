      SUBROUTINE ASTCLEAR( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTCLEAR

*  Purpose:
*     Clear attribute values for an Object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTCLEAR( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application clears the values of a specified set of attributes
*     for an Object. Clearing an attribute cancels any value that has
*     previously been explicitly set for it, so that the standard default
*     attribute value will subsequently be used instead. This also
*     causes the ASTTEST application to return the value FALSE for the
*     attribute, indicating that no value has been set.

*  Usage:
*     astclear this attrib result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ATTRIB = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing a comma-separated list of the names of the
*        attributes to be cleared.
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file to receive the modified Object. If an NDF
*        is supplied, the WCS FrameSet within the NDF will be replaced by
*        the new Object if possible (if it is a FrameSet in which the base
*        Frame has Domain GRID and has 1 axis for each NDF dimension).
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the original Object. If an NDF is
*        supplied, the WCS FrameSet will be used.
