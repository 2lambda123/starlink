      SUBROUTINE ASTQUADAPPROX( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTQUADAPPROX

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain a quadratic approximation to a 2D Mapping.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTQUADAPPROX( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application returns the co-efficients of a quadratic fit to the 
*     supplied Mapping over the input area specified by LBND and UBND.
*     The Mapping must have 2 inputs, but may have any number of outputs. 
*     The i'th Mapping output is modelled as a quadratic function of the 
*     2 inputs (x,y):
*
*     output_i = a_i_0 + a_i_1*x + a_i_2*y + a_i_3*x*y + a_i_4*x*x + 
*                a_i_5*y*y
*
*     The FIT array is returned holding the values of the co-efficients 
*     a_0_0, a_0_1, etc.

*  Usage:
*     astquadapprox this lbnd ubnd nx ny

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FIT() = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        An array returning the co-efficients of the quadratic approximation
*        to the specified transformation.  The first 6 elements hold the 
*        fit to the first Mapping output. The next 6 elements hold the 
*        fit to the second Mapping output, etc. So if the Mapping has 2 
*        inputs and 2 outputs the quadratic approximation to the forward 
*        transformation is:
*
*        X_out = fit(1) + fit(2)*X_in + fit(3)*Y_in + fit(4)*X_in*Y_in +
*                fit(5)*X_in*X_in + fit(6)*Y_in*Y_in
*
*        Y_out = fit(7) + fit(8)*X_in + fit(9)*Y_in + fit(10)*X_in*Y_in +
*                fit(11)*X_in*X_in + fit(12)*Y_in*Y_in
*
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Mapping. If an NDF is supplied,
*        the Mapping from the base Frame of the WCS FrameSet to the
*        current Frame will be used. The Mapping must have 2 inputs.
*     LBND( 2 ) = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        A two element array containing the lower bound of the input region 
*        in each input dimension. If an NDF was supplied for THIS, then a 
*        null (!) value can be supplied in which case a 
*        default will be used corresponding to the GRID cordinates of the 
*        bottom left corner of the bottom left pixel in the NDF (i.e. a 
*        value of 0.5 on every grid axis).
*     NX = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of points to place along the first Mapping input. The
*        first point is at LBND( 1 ) and the last is at UBND( 1 ). If a 
*        value less than three is supplied a value of three will be used.
*        If an NDF was supplied for THIS, then a null 
*        (!) value can be supplied in which case a default will be used 
*        corresponding to the number of pixels along the axis.
*     NY = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of points to place along the second Mapping input. The
*        first point is at LBND( 2 ) and the last is at UBND( 2 ). If a 
*        value less than three is supplied a value of three will be used.
*        If an NDF was supplied for THIS, then a null 
*        (!) value can be supplied in which case a default will be used 
*        corresponding to the number of pixels along the axis.
*     RMS = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        The RMS residual between the mapping and the fit, taken over all
*        outputs.
*     UBND( 2 ) = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        A two element array containing the upper bound of the input region 
*        in each input dimension. If an NDF was supplied for THIS,
*        then a null (!) value can be supplied in which case a 
*        default will be used corresponding to the GRID cordinates of the 
*        top right corner of the top right pixel in the NDF (i.e. a value of 
*        (DIM+0.5) on every grid axis, where DIM is the number of pixels 
*        along the axis).
