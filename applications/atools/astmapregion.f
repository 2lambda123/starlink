      SUBROUTINE ASTMAPREGION( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTMAPREGION

*  Purpose:
*     Transform a Region into a new Frame using a given Mapping

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTMAPREGION( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application returns a pointer to a new Region which
*     corresponds to supplied Region described by some other specified
*     coordinate system. A Mapping is supplied which transforms positions
*     between the old and new coordinate systems. The new Region may not be of
*     the same class as the original region.

*  Usage:
*     astmapregion this map frame result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Frame that describes the
*        coordinate system in which the new Region is required. If an NDF
*        is supplied, the current Frame will be used.
*     MAP = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Mapping which transforms
*        positions from the coordinate system represented by the supplied
*	 Region to the coordinate system specified by FRAME. The supplied
*	 Mapping should define both forward and inverse transformations,
*	 and these transformations should form a genuine inverse pair.
*	 That is, transforming a position using the forward
*	 transformation and then using the inverse transformation should
*	 produce the original input position. Some Mapping classes (such
*	 as PermMap, MathMap, SphMap) can result in Mappings for which
*	 this is not true.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file to receive the new Region.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file holding the original Region.
