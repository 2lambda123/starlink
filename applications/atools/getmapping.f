      SUBROUTINE GETMAPPING( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     GETMAPPING

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain a Mapping that converts between two Frames in a FrameSet.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL GETMAPPING( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application returns a Mapping that will convert coordinates 
*     between the coordinate systems represented by two Frames in a 
*     FrameSet. 

*  Usage:
*     getmapping this frame1 frame2 result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     IFRAME1 = LITERAL (Read)
*        The integer index or Domain name of the first Frame within the
*        FrameSet (the strings AST__BASE and AST__CURRENT may also be
*        supplied). This Frame describes the coordinate system for the 
*        "input" end of the Mapping. 
*     IFRAME2 = LITERAL (Read)
*        The integer index or Domain name of the second Frame within the
*        FrameSet (the strings AST__BASE and AST__CURRENT may also be
*        supplied). This Frame describes the coordinate system for the 
*        "output" end of the Mapping. 
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An text file to receive the Mapping.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the FrameSet. If an NDF is supplied, 
*        the WCS FrameSet will be used.
