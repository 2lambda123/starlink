      SUBROUTINE ASTSPHMAP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTSPHMAP

*  Purpose:
*     Create a SphMap.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTSPHMAP( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new SphMap and optionally initialises
*     its attributes. A SphMap is a Mapping which transforms points from
*     a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system into a 2-dimensional
*     spherical coordinate system (longitude and latitude on a unit
*     sphere centred at the origin). It works by regarding the input
*     coordinates as position vectors and finding their intersection
*     with the sphere surface. The inverse transformation always
*     produces points which are a unit distance from the origin
*     (i.e. unit vectors).

*  Usage:
*     astunitmap options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
*        "STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used
*        if the output object is written to a text file. An error is
*        reported if the output object cannot be written using the
*        requested format. ["AST"]
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new SphMap.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new SphMap.
