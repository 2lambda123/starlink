      SUBROUTINE ASTSETACTUNIT( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTSETACTUNIT

*  Purpose:
*     Set the ActiveUnit flag for a Frame.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTSETACTUNIT( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application sets the current value of the ActiveUnit flag for
*     a Frame, which controls how the Frame behaves when it is used (by
*     ASTFINDFRAME) as a template to match another (target) Frame, or is
*     used as the TO Frame by ASTCONVERT. It determines if the Mapping
*     between the template and target Frames should take differences in
*     axis units into account. The default value for simple Frames is
*     FALSE, which preserves the behaviour of versions of AST prior to
*     version 2.0.
*
*     If the ActiveUnit flag of the template Frame is FALSE, then the
*     Mapping will ignore any difference in the Unit attributes of
*     corresponding template and target axes. In this mode, the Unit
*     attributes are purely descriptive commentary for the benefit of
*     human readers and do not influence the Mappings between Frames.
*     This is the behaviour which all Frames had in older version of AST,
*     prior to the introduction of this attribute.
*
*     If the ActiveUnit flag of the template Frame is .TRUE., then the
*     Mapping from template to target will take account of any difference
*     in the axis Unit attributes, where-ever possible. For instance, if
*     corresponding target and template axes have Unit strings of "km" and
*     "m", then the FrameSet class will use a ZoomMap to connect them
*     which introduces a scaling of 1000. If no Mapping can be found
*     between the corresponding units string, then an error is reported.
*     In this mode, it is assumed that values of the Unit attribute conform
*     to the syntax for units strings described in the FITS WCS Paper I
*     "Representations of world coordinates in FITS" (Greisen & Calabretta).
*     Particularly, any of the named unit symbols, functions, operators or
*     standard multiplier prefixes listed within that paper can be used within
*     a units string. A units string may contain symbols for unit which are
*     not listed in the FITS paper, but transformation to any other units
*     will then not be possible (except to units which depend only on the
*     same unknown units - thus "flops" can be transformed to "Mflops"
*     even though "flops" is not a standard FITS unit symbol).
*
*     If the ActiveUnit flag is .TRUE., setting a new Unit value for an
*     axis may also change its Label and Symbol attributes. For instance, if
*     an axis has Unit "Hz" and Label "frequency", then changing its Unit to
*     "log(Hz)" will change its Label to "log( frequency )". In addition,
*     the Axis Format attribute will be cleared when-ever a new value
*     is assigned to the Unit attribute.
*
*     Note, if a TRUE value is set for the ActiveUnit flag, then changing a
*     Unit value for the current Frame within a FrameSet will result in the
*     Frame being re-mapped (that is, the Mappings which define the
*     relationships between Frames within the FrameSet will be modified to
*     take into account the change in Units).

*  Usage:
*     astsetactunit this value result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file to receive the modified Frame. If an NDF
*        is supplied, the WCS FrameSet within the NDF will be replaced by
*        the new Object if possible (i.e. if it is a FrameSet in which the base
*        Frame has Domain GRID and has 1 axis for each NDF dimension).
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the original Frame. If an NDF is
*        supplied, the WCS FrameSet will be used.
*     VALUE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        The value to assign to the ActiveUnit flag.

*  Notes:
*     - This application corresponds to the AST routine AST_SETACTIVEUNIT.
*     The name has been abbreviated due to a limitation on the length of
*     ADAM command names.
