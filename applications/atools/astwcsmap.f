      SUBROUTINE ASTWCSMAP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTWCSMAP

*  Purpose:
*     Create a WcsMap.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTWCSMAP( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new WcsMap and optionally initialises
*     its attributes.
*
*     A WcsMap is used to represent sky coordinate projections as
*     described in the (draft) FITS world coordinate system (FITS-WCS)
*     paper by E.W. Griesen and M. Calabretta (A & A, in preparation).
*     This paper defines a set of functions, or sky projections, which
*     transform longitude-latitude pairs representing spherical
*     celestial coordinates into corresponding pairs of Cartesian
*     coordinates (and vice versa).
*
*     A WcsMap is a specialised form of Mapping which implements these
*     sky projections and applies them to a specified pair of coordinates.
*     All the projections in the FITS-WCS paper are supported, plus the now
*     deprecated "TAN with polynomial correction terms" projection which
*     is refered to here by the code "TPN". Using the FITS-WCS terminology,
*     the transformation is between "native spherical" and "projection
*     plane" coordinates.  These coordinates may, optionally, be embedded
*     in a space with more than two dimensions, the remaining coordinates
*     being copied unchanged. Note, however, that for consistency with
*     other AST facilities, a WcsMap handles coordinates that represent
*     angles in radians (rather than the degrees used by FITS-WCS).
*
*     The type of FITS-WCS projection to be used and the coordinates
*     (axes) to which it applies are specified when a WcsMap is first
*     created. The projection type may subsequently be determined
*     using the WcsType attribute and the coordinates on which it acts
*     may be determined using the WcsAxis(lonlat) attribute.
*
*     Each WcsMap also allows up to 100 "projection parameters" to be
*     associated with each axis. These specify the precise form of the
*     projection, and are accessed using PVi_m attribute, where "i" is
*     the integer axis index (starting at 1), and m is an integer
*     "parameter index" in the range 0 to 99. The number of projection
*     parameters required by each projection, and their meanings, are
*     dependent upon the projection type (most projections either do not
*     use any projection parameters, or use parameters 1 and 2 associated
*     with the latitude axis). Before creating a WcsMap you should consult
*     the FITS-WCS paper for details of which projection parameters are
*     required, and which have defaults. When creating the WcsMap, you must
*     explicitly set values for all those required projection parameters
*     which do not have defaults defined in this paper.

*  Usage:
*     astwcsmap ncoord type lonax latax options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     LATAX = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The index of the latitude axis. This should lie in the range
*        1 to NCOORD and be distinct from LONAX.
*     LONAX = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The index of the longitude axis. This should lie in the range
*        1 to NCOORD.
*     NCOORD = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of coordinate values for each point to be
*        transformed (i.e. the number of dimensions of the space in
*        which the points will reside). This must be at least 2. The
*        same number is applicable to both input and output points.
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new WcsMap.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new WcsMap.
*     TYPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The type of FITS-WCS projection to apply. This should be
*        given as a string value such as "AST__TAN" (for a tangent
*        plane projection), where the characters following the double
*        underscore give the projection type code (in upper case) as
*        used in the FITS-WCS "CTYPEi" keyword. You should consult the
*        FITS-WCS paper for a list of the available projections. The
*        additional code of "AST__TPN" can be supplied which represents a
*        TAN projection with polynomial correction terms as defined in an
*        early draft of the FITS-WCS paper.
