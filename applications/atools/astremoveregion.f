      SUBROUTINE ASTREMOVEREGION( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTREMOVEREGION

*  Purpose:
*     Remove any Regions from a Mapping.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTREMOVEREGION( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application searches the supplied Mapping (which may be a 
*     compound Mapping such as a CmpMap) for any component Mappings 
*     that are instances of the AST Region class. It then creates a new
*     Mapping from which all Regions have been removed. If a Region
*     cannot simply be removed (for instance, if it is a component of a
*     parallel CmpMap), then it is replaced with an equivalent UnitMap 
*     in the returned Mapping.

*  Usage:
*     astremoveregion this result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the modified Mapping.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Mapping. If an NDF is supplied, 
*        the Mapping from the base Frame of the WCS FrameSet to the
*        current Frame will be used.
