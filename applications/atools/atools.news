1 ATOOLS

 Version 1.6 of ATOOLS is now available. It is fully documented in SUN/???.

 ATOOLS is a package of applications which manipulate descriptions
 of coordinate frames, mappings, etc, in the form of AST Objects (see
 SUN/210). Each application within the ATOOLS package corresponds closely
 to one of the functions within the AST library. ATOOLS thus provides a
 high-level interface to the AST library. 

  Changes in this release:

  - New commands added: astshiftmap. These are straight analogues of the 
  corresponding AST routines.
