1 ATOOLS

 Version 1.7-1 of ATOOLS is now available. It is fully documented in SUN/???.

 ATOOLS is a package of applications which manipulate descriptions
 of coordinate frames, mappings, etc, in the form of AST Objects (see
 SUN/210). Each application within the ATOOLS package corresponds closely
 to one of the functions within the AST library. ATOOLS thus provides a
 high-level interface to the AST library. 


  Changes in V1.7-1:

  - New command asttran1. Transforms 1-dimension positions.


  Changes in V1.6-3:

  - New command asttranmap. Creates a TranMap.


  Changes in V1.6-2:

  - New command astpolymap. Creates a PolyMap.

  - New command astmathmap. Creates a MathMap.

  - New command asttran2. Uses a Mapping to transform a set of 2-D
  positions. Unlike asttrann, this command does not use NDFs to store the
  input and output positions. The input positions can be given in a text
  file or in response to parameter prompts. Output positions are written
  to the screen and optionally to an output text file.

  - New command astformat. Formats one or more axis values using the
  attributes of a supplied Frame.

  - New command astsetactunit. Sets the value of the ActiveUnit flag
  for a Frame, which determines how the Unit attribute of the Frame is used.
  This corresponds to the AST_SETACTIVEUNIT routine (the name has been
  abbreviated because of a limitation on the length of ADAM command names).

  - New command astgetactunit. Returns the value of the ActiveUnit flag
  for a Frame. This corresponds to the AST_GETACTIVEUNIT routine.

  - The informational messages which say where the output data has been
  written to are now only produced if the environment variable
  ATOOLS_VERBOSE is defined.


  Changes in V1.6-1:

  - A bug has been fixed which could cause output text files to be
  truncated when ATOOLS commands are used from ICL (or other similar
  environments).


  Changes in V1.6:

  - New commands added: astshiftmap. These are straight analogues of the 
  corresponding AST routines.
