      SUBROUTINE ASTTRANMAP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTTRANMAP

*  Purpose:
*     Create a TranMap.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTTRANMAP( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new TranMap and optionally initialises its
*     attributes.
*
*     A TranMap is a Mapping which combines the forward transformation of
*     a supplied Mapping with the inverse transformation of another
*     supplied Mapping, ignoring the un-used transformation in each
*     Mapping (indeed the un-used transformation need not exist).
*
*     When the forward transformation of the TranMap is referred to, the
*     transformation actually used is the forward transformation of the
*     first Mapping supplied when the TranMap was constructed. Likewise,
*     when the inverse transformation of the TranMap is referred to, the
*     transformation actually used is the inverse transformation of the
*     second Mapping supplied when the TranMap was constructed.

*  Usage:
*     asttranmap map1 map2 options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     MAP1 = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the first component Mapping, which
*        defines the forward transformation. If an NDF is supplied, the
*        Mapping from the Base Frame to the Current Frame of its WCS FrameSet
*        will be used.
*     MAP2 = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the second component Mapping, which
*        defines the inverse transformation. If an NDF is supplied, the
*        Mapping from the Base Frame to the Current Frame of its WCS FrameSet
*        will be used.
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new TranMap.
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        A text file to receive the new TranMap.
