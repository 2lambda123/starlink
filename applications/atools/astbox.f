      SUBROUTINE ASTBOX( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTBOX

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Box.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTBOX( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new Box and optionally initialises
*     its attributes. 
*
*     The Box class implements a Region which represents a box with sides 
*     parallel to the axes of a Frame (i.e. an area which encloses a given 
*     range of values on each axis). A Box is similar to an Box, the
*     only real difference being that the Box class allows some axis
*     limits to be unspecified. Note, a Box will only look like a box if
*     the Frame geometry is approximately flat. For instance, a Box centred
*     close to a pole in a SkyFrame will look more like a fan than a box
*     (the Polygon class can be used to create a box-like region close to
*     a pole).

*  Usage:
*     astbox frame form point1 point2 unc options result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FRAME = LITERAL (Read) 
*        An NDF or text file holding the Frame in which the region is defined.
*        If an NDF is supplied, the current Frame in its WCS FrameSet will be 
*        used.
*     FORM = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Indicates how the box is described by the remaining parameters.
*        A value of zero indicates that the box is specified by a centre 
*        position and a corner position. A value of one indicates that the 
*        box is specified by a two opposite corner positions.
*     POINT1 = GROUP (Read)
*        A comma-separated list of floating point values with one element 
*        for each Frame axis (Naxes attribute). If FORM is zero, this list
*        should contain the coordinates at the centre of the box. If FORM
*        is one, it should contain the coordinates at the corner of the box
*        which is diagonally opposite the corner specified by POINT2.
*     POINT2 = GROUP (Read)
*        A comma-separated list of floating point values with one element 
*        for each Frame axis (Naxes attribute) containing the coordinates 
*        at any corner of the box.
*     OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
*        A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute 
*        assignments to be used for initialising the new Box. 
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An text file to receive the new Box. 
*     UNC = LITERAL (Read) 
*        An optional text file containing an existing Region which
*        specifies the uncertainties associated with each point on the
*        boundary of the Box being created. The uncertainty at any
*        point on the Box is found by shifting the supplied
*        "uncertainty" Region so that it is centred at the point being
*        considered. The area covered by the shifted uncertainty Region
*        then represents the uncertainty in the position. The uncertainty
*        is assumed to be the same for all points.
*
*        If supplied, the uncertainty Region must be either a Box, a Circle
*        or an Ellipse. Alternatively, a null value (!) may be supplied, in 
*        which case a default uncertainty is used equivalent to a box 
*        1.0E-6 of the size of the bounding box of the Box being created.
*
*        The uncertainty Region has two uses: 1) when the astOverlap
*        function compares two Regions for equality the uncertainty
*        Region is used to determine the tolerance on the comparison, and 2)
*        when a Region is mapped into a different coordinate system and
*        subsequently simplified (using astSimplify), the uncertainties are 
*        used to determine if the transformed boundary can be accurately 
*        represented by a specific shape of Region.
