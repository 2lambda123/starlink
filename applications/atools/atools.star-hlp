 Welcome to the ATOOLS online help system.  

 The applications in the ATOOLS package follow closely the routines of
 the same names in the AST library. The AST documentation (SUN/210) is 
 not repeated here but should be consulted when using these commands.
 The parameters of a given ATOOLS command correspond to those of the 
 same AST routine, so for further information on (say) the ATOOLS
 astremapframe command, see the entry for the AST_REMAPFRAME routine in 
 SUN/210. Any differences in behaviour between the AST routine and the
 corresponding ATOOLS command are noted in the documentation for the
 command.

 Many of these commands require AST Objects to be supplied as input. 
 These may be supplied in several formats:

 - as a dump of an AST Object stored in a text file (as produced by the
 AST_SHOW routine).

 - as an NDF, in which case the WCS FrameSet is used (an error is
 reported if the ATOOLS command required an Object of a different class).

 - as a text file containing a series of FITS headers conforming to one
 of the supported FITS encoding of WCS information, in which case the
 corresponding FrameSet will be used (an error is reported if the ATOOLS
 command required an Object of a different class).


 Many of the ATOOLS commands create new AST Objects as output. These may be 
 stored in the following ways:

 - If the name of an existing NDF is supplied for the parameter, the new
 AST Object will be stored in the NDF as a WCS FrameSet, replacing any
 existing WCS FrameSet. An error will be reported if the new AST Object
 is not suitable for being used as a WCS FrameSet.

 - Otherwise, a new text file is created with the given name containing a
 dump of the Object.

 - A bug has been fixed which could cause output text files to be
 truncated when ATOOLS commands are used from ICL (or other similar
 environments).



1 ASTSHOW

 This is a simple tcl script which allows you to browse an AST Object in
 a heirarchical manner. The AST object must be contained in a text file
 (to examine the WCS FrameSet of an NDF, use the wcsshow command in
 KAPPA). Clicking on a component of an Object will open a new window
 containing a listing of the components of the selected Object.
 Individual components of the Object can be saved to text files (the
 names of these text files are fixed, and determined by the name of the
 Object being saved).

 
 Invocation:

    %  astshow <file>
 
 where <file> is the name of the text file containing the AST object. An
 error will be reported if no file is specified on the command line.
