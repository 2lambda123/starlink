htlatex has a lot of options. Current command line example is:

htlatex sc21.tex "starlinkxhtml.cfg,xhtml,mathml,charset=utf-8,fn-in" '  -cvalidate -cunihtf'

Where starlinkxhtml.cfg loads the correct configuration file,

xhtml and mathml define the output.

charset=utf-8 gives you unicode characters.

fn-in gives footnotes at the bottom of page (although note if you redefine the lower crosslinks you can accidentally hide this)

 -cunihtf has been added back in in order to allow \mathcal and \mathfrak to work correctly. IT MAY BREAK OTHER THINGS! check if there is weirdness
