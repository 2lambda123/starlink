htlatex has a lot of options. Current command line example is:


htlatex sc21.tex "starlinkxhtml.cfg,charset="utf-8",fn-in" '  -cvalidate '

Where starlinkxhtml.cfg loads the correct configuration file,

charset=utf-8 gives you unicode characters (otherwise accents are broken)

fn-in gives footnotes at the bottom of page (although note if you
redefine the lower crosslinks you can accidentally hide this)



Using the flag -cunihtf will be default use unicode ligature characters. These
prevent browsers from correctly searching etc, so don't turn it on.
If its needed, then you can use the hacked unicode.4hf file in this
directory, which turns off the ligatures at issue. This will need to
be copied into the: 

TEXLIVE/2013/texmf-dist/tex4ht/ht-fonts/unicode/charset/ directory.

(It will overwrite a file of the same name already there).

It should be possible to tell tex4ht to look at a different location
for the file, but I'm not sure how to do it.


Tex4ht.env configuration:

To use the local env file here, please set the environmental variable
TEX4HTENV to the full path of this file.
