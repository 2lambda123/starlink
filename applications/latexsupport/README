htlatex has a lot of options. Current command line example is:


htlatex sc21.tex "starlinkxhtml.cfg,charset="utf-8",fn-in" '  -cvalidate -cstarfont'


Where starlinkxhtml.cfg loads the correct configuration file,

charset=utf-8 gives you unicode characters (otherwise accents are broken)

fn-in gives footnotes at the bottom of page (although note if you
redefine the lower crosslinks you can accidentally hide this)

-cstarfont will use a custom htf font setup, which is the same as the
 unihtf option except that it turns off standard ligatures. This is to
 ensure that search within the html output works correctly.

This is a custom option, and to use it you must set the TEX4HTENV and
the TEX4HTHTF environmental variables. (see below)

Using the flag -cunihtf will by default use unicode ligature
characters. These prevent browsers from correctly searching etc, so
don't turn it on. There are many other htf flags, but if not using
unicode characters tex4ht will frequently use images for e.g. \cal
math characters and this will breka mathjax.


Tex4ht.env configuration:

To use the local env file here, please set the environmental variable
TEX4HTENV to the full path of this file.

And then set the TEX4HTHTF environmental variable to e.g. (the latexsupport directory).

e.g.
export TEX4HTENV=/Users/sarah/JAC/StarSoft/starlink/applications/latexsupport/tex4ht.env
export TEX4HTHTF=:/Users/sarah/JAC/StarSoft/starlink/applications/latexsupport/:

Note that this environmental variable must have a character marking
the beginning and end of the path that does not appear within the
path.
