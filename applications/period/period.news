 PERIOD 5.0-3        01-JUN-2006
 ============

 PERIOD has been imported into the Starlink CVS repository. A memory
 allocation bug has been fixed and the code updated to work on 64 bit
 machines. 


 PERIOD 5.0-2
 ============

 Fixes a bug in the sine fitting subroutine, apparent with the CHISQ command

 Fixes a bug which caused OGIP to crash
  
 PERIOD - Time-series analysis package
 =====================================

 The PERIOD time-series analysis package has been updated.

 PERIOD 5.0 is a major release that supercedes version 4.2, and is
 available under Solaris, Tru64 Unix and Linux.

 This is a Double Precision implementation of PERIOD, which has been
 reconfigured to utilise dynamic array allocation/deallocation for the
 majority of its input, output and work arrays.

 Some potential for problems associated with array-bounds violation 
 within version 4.2, identified during the source-code preparation for
 5.0, have been avoided with the exact calculation within PERIOD 5.0 of
 storage required by its various processing elements. The ability to
 handle data loads of varying magnitude, with efficient use of memory
 for storage, should adequately compensate for any marginal overhead
 imposed by array-size calculations and the attendant memory management.

 Overall, the 'look and feel' of PERIOD remains fundamentally the same.

 Error messages and help text have been revised in line with the
 implementation of dynamic array allocation; the document SUN/167 has
 been updated accordingly. A Hypertext version is available
 (`showme sun167' or `findme period').
