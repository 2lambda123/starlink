*  Name:
*     POL1_CM1RR

*  Purpose:
*     To combine a stack of array lines into one line, using a variety
*     of methods. REAL version.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POL1_CM1RR( STACK, NPIX, NLINES, VARS, METH, MINPIX,
*                      NSIGMA, RESULT, RESVAR, WRK1, WRK2, PP, COVEC, 
*                      NMAT, NCON, POINT, USED, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine works along each line of the input stack of lines,
*     combining the data. This variant uses a complete variance array
*     propagates them .  All work is done in single precision when
*     possible and double precision when not.  Note that the output
*     arrays are in the processing precision.  The array NCON holds the
*     actual numbers of pixels which were used in deriving the output
*     value plus any values already present in the array - thus a
*     cumilative sum of contributing pixel numbers may be kept.

*  Arguments:
*     STACK( NPIX, NLINES ) = <COMM> (Given)
*        The array of lines which are to be combined into a single line.
*     NPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of pixels in a line of data.
*     NLINES = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of lines of data in the stack.
*     VARS( NPIX, NLINES ) = <COMM> (Given)
*        The data variances.
*     METH = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The method to use in combining the lines. One of 'MEAN', 'MEDIAN',
*        or 'SIGMA'.
*     MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        The minimum number of pixels required to contribute to an
*        output pixel.
*     NSIGMA = REAL (Given)
*        The number of sigmas to clip the data at (METH = SIGMA).
*     RESULT( NPIX ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The output line of data.
*     RESVAR( NPIX ) = REAL (Returned)
*        The output variances.
*     WRK1( NLINES ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace for calculations.
*     WRK2( NLINES ) = REAL (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace for calculations.
*     PP( NLINES ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace for order statistics calculations.
*     COVEC( NMAT, NLINES ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace for storing ordered statistics variace-covariance
*        matrix.
*     NCON( NLINES ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
*        The actual number of contributing pixels from each input line
*        to the output line.
*     POINT( NLINES ) = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace to hold pointers to the original positions of the
*        data before extraction and conversion in to the WRK1 array.
*     USED( NLINES ) =LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        Workspace used to indicate which values have been used in
*        estimating a resultant value.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - The 'propagation' of the input variances assumes that the input
*     data are fairly represented by a normal distribution. This fact
*     is used together with the 'order statistics' of a normal
*     population to form a new variance estimate. The order statistics
*     are not independent so have non-zero covariances (off diagonal
*     components of the variance-covariance matrix). All 'trimmed
*     means' of any description use the order of the values to
*     estimate which values are corrupt. This applies to all the
*     methods supported here except the mean which rejects no data. The
*     variance used to represent the input normal population is the
*     reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocal variances. We have no
*     other estimate of this value except from the population itself.
*
*     - NMAT = NLINES * ( NLINES + 1 )/ 2 at least.
