POLPACK is a package of applications for mapping the linear or circular
polarization of extended astronomical objects, using data obtained from a
dual-beam polarimeter. At the moment, Stokes vectors cannot be produced
for single-beam data. It is assumed that the analyser is stepped in units
of 45 degrees and that no rotation occurs between target exposures. Other
assumptions regarding the specific form of the data or the polarimeter
have, as far as possible, been avoided.

POLPACK processes data in NDF format. However, other astronomical data
formats may also be processed using transparent on-the-fly data
conversion facilities provided by the NDF subroutine library, and the
CONVERT package.

The facilities provided by POLPACK include:

  o  alignment of images on the sky.
  o  extraction of O and E images from a single frame.
  o  sky subtraction.
  o  calculation of Stokes parameters.
  o  binning of Stokes parameters.
  o  creation of catalogues of polarization vectors.
  o  graphical display of vector maps.

POLPACK does not provide facilities for performing instrumental
corrections such as flat-fielding, de-biassing, etc. Such corrections
should be applied to the data before using POLPACK, so that POLPACK can
assume that pixel values are proportional to the combined intensity of
sky and object. Corrections can be made, howeve, to take account of any
differences in the exposure times between raw frames, and any difference
in the sensitivity of the two channels of the dual-beam polarimeter.
These corrections rely on redundancy in the supplied data, and require a
specific set of analyser positions to be used.
