      SUBROUTINE POL1_GTVRS( INDF, VTEST, OK, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     POL1_GTVRS

*  Purpose:
*     Check that the POLPACK version number in a POLPACK NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POL1_GTVRS( INDF, VTEST, OK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine extracts the version number from the VERSION component
*     of the POLPACK extension in the supplied NDF. It then compares this
*     version with the version supplied in VTEST. If the NDF was created
*     by an earlier version of POLPACK than that indicated by VTEST, then 
*     OK is returned false. Otherwise OK is returned true.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        An identifier for the NDF.
*     VTEST = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The earliest version of of POLPACK which created NDFs which can
*        be processed by the calling application. This should be in the
*        form "m.n-r" where m, n and r are integers. Missing trailing
*        fields default to zero.
*     OK = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Can the NDF be processed by the application?
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Get the VERSION item from the POLPACK extension, using the above

*  Split the version number up into its components.
