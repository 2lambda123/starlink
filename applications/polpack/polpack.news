1 POLPACK

 Version 3.4 of POLPACK (an applications package for processing imaging
 polarimetry data) is now available. It is fully documented in SUN/223.

 The main changes since V3.4 are:

 o The ANGLE parameter of the POLROTREF command now specifies the
 position angle of the required referecne direction, rather than the
 angle though which to rotate the reference direction. ANY EXISTING
 SCRIPTS THAT USE "ANGLE" WILL NEED TO BE CHANGED.
