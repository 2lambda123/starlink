1 POLPACK

 Version 3.3 of POLPACK (an applications package for processing imaging
 polarimetry data) is now available. It is fully documented in SUN/223.

 The main changes since V3.3 are:

 o  POLKA no longer supports an unconstrained full 6-coefficient linear fit.

 o  A bug has been fixed in POLKA that could cause dialog boxes to flash
    uncontrollably when partially obscured by the main polka window.
