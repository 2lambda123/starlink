1 POLPACK

 Version 3.2 of POLPACK (an applications package for processing imaging
 polarimetry data) is now available. It is fully documented in SUN/223.

 The main changes since V3.2 are:

 o  A new command POLROTREF has been added to rotate the reference
 direction of a pair of Q and U images.

 o  The POLVEC command now omits vectors from positions that have
 negative total intensity values.
