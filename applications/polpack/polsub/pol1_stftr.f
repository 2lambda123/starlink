      SUBROUTINE POL1_STFTR( NCARD, FITS, VAL, FTNAM, ICARD, COMMNT, 
     :                       NEW, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     POL1_STFTR

*  Purpose:
*     Store a given real value as a FITS card.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POL1_STFTR( NCARD, FITS, VAL, FTNAM, ICARD, COMMNT, NEW, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine stores the supplied real value as a FITS header card 
*     using the keyword name given by FTNAM, in an array of character strings.
*
*     If the keyword already exists in the FITS array, then its value is
*     replaced. Otherwise, the new card is stored at index ICARD.

*  Arguments:
*     NCARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of cards to be searched in the FITS array. 
*     FITS( * ) = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The array holding the FITS cards.
*     VAL = REAL (Given)
*        The value to store.
*     FTNAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The name of the FITS keyword to be used.
*     ICARD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index within FITS at which to store the named component, if
*        an existing card for the keyword cannot be found.
*     COMMNT = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The comment to include in the FITS header card.
*     NEW = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Was no existing card found for the specified keyword?
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
