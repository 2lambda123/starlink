      SUBROUTINE POLCAL( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     POLCAL

*  Purpose:
*     Converts a set of analysed intensity images into a cube holding Stokes 
*     vectors.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POLCAL( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application converts a set of 2D intensity images into a
*     3D data cube holding a Stokes vector at every pixel in the area
*     covered by the supplied intensity images.
*
*     Either dual or single beam data can be processed, with an
*     appropriate algorithm being used in each case. There is also an
*     option to process dual-beam data using the single beam algorithm
*     (see parameter DUALBEAM).
*
*     All the input images should be aligned pixel-for-pixel, and should
*     have had the sky background removed. O and E ray images in
*     dual-beam data should have been extracted into separate images. 
*
*     The output consists of a 3D cube containing values of I, Q and U
*     in planes 1, 2 and 3. Currently, circular polarimetry can only be 
*     performed by the dual-beam algorithm, in which case the output cube 
*     contains only 2 planes holding I and V values (see parameter PMODE). 

*  Usage:
*     polcal in out

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     DEZERO = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the single-beam algorithm
*        when parameter WEIGHTS is set to 3. If TRUE, a constant value
*        is added to the data values read from each input data array 
*        to correct for any differences in zero points. The constant
*        value used for each input array is chosen so that the residuals
*        between the input array and the corresponding intensity values
*        implied by the Stokes vectors produced on the previous iteration, 
*        have a mean value of zero. Selecting the DEZERO option can
*        reduce the variances in the output cube, but usually slows down 
*        convergence of the iterative procedure. Thus you may have to give 
*        a larger value for parameter MAXIT, resulting in significantly 
*        longer run time. [FALSE]
*     DUALBEAM = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then the input images are processed as dual-beam data.
*        If FALSE they are processed as single-beam data. If a null (!)
*        value is supplied, the dual-beam algorithm is used if all the input
*        images contain a legal value for the RAY item in the POLPACK
*        extension (i.e. either "E" or "O"). Otherwise, the single-beam
*        algorithm is used. It is possible to process dual-beam data using
*        the single-beam algorithm, so DUALBEAM may be set to FALSE even
*        if the input images hold dual-beam data. However, the opposite
*        is not true; the application will abort if DUALBEAM is set TRUE and 
*        any of the input images contain single-beam data. [!]
*     ETOL = _REAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the dual-beam algorithm. The E 
*        factors are found using an iterative procedure in which the supplied 
*        intensity images are corrected using the current estimates of the E 
*        factors, and new estimates are then calculated on the basis of these 
*        corrected images. This procedure continues until the change in 
*        E-factor produced by an iteration is less than the value supplied 
*        for ETOL, or the maximum number of iterations specified by parameter 
*        MAXIT is reached. [0.01]
*     ILEVEL = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Specifies the amount of information to display on the screen.
*        Zero suppresses all output. A value of 1 produces minimal output
*        describing such things as warnings and the E and F factors
*        adopted (in dual-beam mode). A value of 2 produces more verbose 
*        output including details of each iteration in the iterative
*        processes used by both dual and single beam modes. A value of
*        3 produces additional details about each individual input image in
*        single beam mode. [1]
*     IN = NDF (Update)
*        A group specifying the names of the input intensity images. This
*        may take the form of a comma separated list, or any of the other 
*        forms described in the help on "Group Expressions". Read access
*        only is required unless the SETVAR parameter is assigned a TRUE
*        value.
*     MAXIT = _INTEGER (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by both single and dual-beam 
*        algorithm, but is used slightly differently in each case. 
*
*        In dual beam mode, it specifies the maximum number of iterations 
*        to be used when inter-comparing pairs of input images to determine 
*        their relative scale-factor and/or zero-point. If the specified 
*        number of iterations is exceeded without achieving the accuracy 
*        required by the settings of the TOLS and TOLZ parameters, then a 
*        warning message will be issued, but the results will still be used. 
*        The value given for MAXIT must be at least one. The runtime
*        default value is 30.

*        In single-beam mode, it specifies the maximum number of iterations 
*        to be used when estimating input variances or rejecting aberrant 
*        input values. The default value depends on the value supplied for 
*        parameter WEIGHTS. If WEIGHTS indicates that estimates of the input
*        variances are to be made (i.e. if WEIGHTS has the value 2 or 3), 
*        then the default value is 8. Otherwise, if variances in the input 
*        NDFs are to be used (i.e. if WEIGHTS is 1), the default is zero. 
*        This is because each iteration is a computationally expensive 
*        process, and so iterations should only be performed if they are 
*        really necessary. MAXIT is always fixed at zero if WEIGHTS is 4
*        (i.e. if all input data are given constant weight). See also
*        parameter TOLR. []
*     MINFRAC = _REAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the single-beam algorithm
*        when iteratively rejecting input values (i.e. if MAXIT is
*        greater than zero). It controls how much good input data is 
*        required to form a good output pixel. It is given as a fraction 
*        in the range 0 to 1. The miminum number of good input values 
*        required to form a good output value at a particular pixel is 
*        equal to this fraction multiplied by the number of input NDFs 
*        which have good values for the pixel. The number is rounded to 
*        the nearest integer and limited to at least 3. If ILEVEL is
*        greater than 1, then the percentage of output pixels which fail 
*        this test is displayed. [0.0]
*     NSIGMA = _REAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the single-beam algorithm. It
*        specifies the threshold at which to reject input data values. If
*        an input data value differs from the data value implied by the
*        current I, Q and U values by more than NSIGMA standard
*        deviations, then it will not be included in the next calculation
*        of I, Q and U. [3.0]
*     OUT = NDF (Read)
*        The name of the output 3D cube holding the Stokes parameters.
*        The x-y plane of this cube covers the overlap region of the 
*        supplied intensity images. Plane 1 contains the total intensity. 
*        The other planes contain either Q and U, or V, depending on the 
*        value of parameter PMODE.
*     PMODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the dual-beam algorithm. It
*        gives the mode of operation; CIRCULAR for measuring circular 
*        polarization, or LINEAR for measuring linear polarization. In 
*        circular mode, the only legal values for the POLPACK extension 
*        item "WPLATE" are 0.0 and 45.0. Currently, the single-beam algorithm 
*        can only perform linear polarimetry. [LINEAR]
*     SETVAR = _REAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the single-beam algorithm.
*        If a TRUE value is supplied for SETVAR, and if the variances in 
*        the input images are being estimated (see parameter WEIGHTS), then
*        the final mean variance estimate found for each input image will
*        be stored as a constant value in the VARIANCE component of the input 
*        image. [FALSE]
*     SKYSUP = _REAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the dual-beam algorithm. It is
*        a positive "sky noise suppression factor" used to control the
*        effects of sky noise when pairs of input images are
*        inter-compared to determine their relative scale-factor. It is
*        intended to prevent the resulting scale-factor estimate being
*        biased by the many similar values present in the "sky
*        background" of typical astronomical data.  SKYSUP controls an
*        algorithm which reduces the weight given to data where there
*        is a high density of points with the same value, in order to
*        suppress this effect. 
*
*        A SKYSUP value of unity can often be effective, but a value
*        set by the approximate ratio of sky pixels to useful object
*        pixels (i.e. those containing non-sky signal) in a "typical"
*        image will usually be better. The precise value
*        is not critical. A value of zero disables the sky noise
*        suppression algorithm completely. The default value for SKYSUP
*        is 10. This is normally reasonable for CCD frames of extended 
*        objects such as galaxies, but a larger value, say 100, may give 
*        slightly better results for star fields. [10]
*     SMBOX = _INTEGER (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the single-beam algorithm. It
*        specifies the size (in pixels) of the smoothing box to use
*        when estimating the variance of the input data. It is only 
*        accessed if parameter WEIGHTS is given the value 2 or 3 (i.e. if 
*        input variances are to be estimated from the spread of the input 
*        data values). 
*
*        The error of a given input intensity value can be estimated 
*        in two ways, by its deviation from the sine curve connecting 
*        analysed intensity and analyser position, or from its deviation
*        from its local neighbours. The second method requires a spatial
*        smoothing to be performed, the size of which is specified by
*        SMBOX. However, spatial smoothing can introduce problems because
*        it can cause spatial structure in the image to be interpreted as
*        noise, resulting in over-estimates of the input variances. For
*        this reason it is best to use a small smoothing size. If you
*        have data for many analyser positions (say 8 or more) you could
*        even set SMBOX to zero in order to prevent any spatial smoothing
*        being performed. In this case, the errors are based purely on
*        deviations from the expected sine curves. If you do not have
*        this many analyser positions, you should use some spatial
*        smoothing. For instance if you only had data for three analyser
*        positions (the minimum possible number), then the sine curves
*        would fit the supplied data exactly, no matter what the noise
*        may be, and would consequently give no information about the input
*        variances. In this case, a larger value of SMBOX (say 9) may be
*        necessary. [3]
*     TITLE = LITERAL (Read)
*        A title for the output cube. [Output from POLCAL]
*     TOLR = _INTEGER (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the single-beam algorithm. It
*        specifies the convergence criterion for the iterative process
*        which estimates the input variances, and rejects bad input values.
*        If the number of pixels rejected from any input NDF changes by more 
*        than TOLR pixels between two succesive iterations, then the process 
*        is assumed not to have converged and another iteration will be 
*        performed unless MAXIT iterations have already been performed. [0]
*     TOLS = _REAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the dual-beam algorithm. It
*        defines the accuracy tolerance to be achieved when inter-comparing 
*        pairs of input images to determine their relative scale-factor. The 
*        value given for TOLS specifies the tolerable fractional error in the 
*        estimation of the relative scale-factor between any pair of input 
*        NDFs. This value must be positive. [0.001]
*     TOLZ = _REAL (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the dual-beam algorithm. It
*        defines the accuracy tolerance to be achieved when inter-comparing 
*        pairs of input images to determine their relative zero-points. The 
*        value given for TOLZ specifies the tolerable absolute error in the 
*        estimation of the relative zero-point between any pair of input 
*        images whose relative scale-factor is unity. The value used is 
*        multiplied by the relative scale-factor estimate (which reflects the 
*        fact that an image with a larger data range can tolerate a larger 
*        error in estimating its zero-point). The TOLS value supplied must 
*        be positive. [0.05]
*     VARIANCE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter should be set to a TRUE value if variances are to
*        be included in the output cube. A null (!) value results in variance 
*        values being created if possible, but not otherwise. [!]
*     WEIGHTS = _INTEGER (Read)
*        This parameter is only accessed by the single-beam algorithm. It
*        indicates how the weight and variance associated with each input 
*        intensity value should be chosen. It should be an integer in the 
*        range 1 to 4. These values select the following schemes:
*        
*        - 1 -- Use the variances supplied with the input images. The
*        reciprocal of these variances are used as weights. If any input 
*        images do not have associated variances then a constant weight of 
*        1.0 will be used for all input images.
*
*        - 2 -- Use the variances supplied with the input images. If any
*        input images do not have associated variances then estimates of 
*        the variances are made for all input images based on the spread of 
*        data values. The reciprocal of these variances are used as weights. 
*        An error will be reported if parameter MAXIT is set to zero, thus
*        preventing the iterative estimation of input variances.
*
*        - 3 -- Use estimates of the variances for all input images based 
*        on the spread of data values. The reciprocal of these variances 
*        are used as weights. Any variances supplied with the input images 
*        are ignored. An error will be reported if parameter MAXIT is set to 
*        zero, thus preventing the iterative estimation of input variances.
*
*        - 4 -- Use a constant weight of 1.0 for all input images. Any 
*        variances supplied with the input images are ignored. The
*        iterative rejection of bad input values controlled by parameter
*        MAXIT and TOLR is not available in this mode.
*
*        The dual-beam algorithm always uses scheme 1. [1]
 
*  The Single-beam Algorithm:
*        In single-bean mode, the I, Q and U values at each output pixel are 
*        chosen to minimise the sum of the squared residuals between the 
*        supplied intensity values and the intensity values implied by the I, 
*        Q and U values (this is equivalent to fitting sine curves to the 
*        input intensity values). Input intensity values are weighted 
*        according to the scheme chosen using parameter WEIGHTS. The basic 
*        algorithm is described by Sparks and Axon (submitted to P.A.S.P.). 
*
*        Single beam mode can take account of imperfections in the analyser.
*        The transmission (i.e. the overall throughput) and efficiency
*        (i.e. the ability to reject light polarized across the axis) of the 
*        analyser are read from the POLPACK extension. If not found, values 
*        of 1.0 are used for both. These values are appropriate for a
*        perfect analyser. A perfectly bad analyser (a piece of high quality 
*        glass for instance) would have a transmission of 2.0 and an
*        efficiency of zero. The extension items named T and EPS hold the
*        transmission and efficiency.
*
*        Single beam mode can handle data taken by polarimeters containing
*        a number of fixed analysers, or a single rotating analyser, in
*        addition to the normal combination of fixed analyser and rotating
*        half-wave plate. The POLPACK extension in each input image should 
*        contain either a WPLATE value (giving the angle between a fixed
*        analyser and the half-wave plate), or an ANLANG value (giving the
*        angle between the rotating or fixed analyser and the polarimeter 
*        reference direction). Only one of these two extension items
*        should be present. The WPLATE and ANLANG items are free to take
*        any value (i.e. they are not restricted to the values 0.0, 22.5,
*        45.0 and 67.5 degrees as in the dual-beam algorithm).
*
*        If the input intensity images do not contain usable variances,
*        then estimates of these variances can be made from the spread of
*        supplied data values. This is an expensive iterative process
*        (see parameters TOLR and WEIGHTS). Initially, Stokes vectors
*        are estimated assigning a uniform constant weight to all input
*        data values. The I, Q and U images are then smoothed by fitting
*        a quadratic surface to the data within a box centred on each
*        pixel (the size of the box can be specified using parameter
*        SMBOX). For each input image, a similar image is then created
*        holding the squared residual between the input intensity values, 
*        and the intensity values implied by the smoothed Stokes vectors 
*        (using the known analyser positions, etc, for the images). These
*        images containing squared residuals are then stacked together
*        to obtain a single image holding the mean squared residual at
*        each pixel. This image is then smoothed using a mean box filter
*        of size specified by parameter SMBOX. The values in the resulting 
*        image are used as the variance estimates for the input data (note,
*        the same variance estimates are used for all the input images).
*
*        If the input arrays have differing zero points, the residuals
*        for any one image will usually not be centred on zero, but will
*        have some non-zero mean determined by the zero point for the
*        array. If uncorrected this would led to an artifically high
*        estimate of the input variance. There is an option (see parameter 
*        DEZERO) to reduce this effect, by using the mean of the residuals 
*        as a zero point correction for the input array. Note however, that
*        selecting this option will usually result in significantly
*        longer run times, and may require larger values for parameter
*        MAXIT.
*        
*        In order to provide some safe-guards against aberrant values in 
*        the input images, input data values which are badly inconsistent 
*        with the smoothed Stokes vectors are rejected at this point. Pixels
*        are rejected if the corresponding squared residual is greater than 
*        NSIGMA times the standard deviation expected for the pixel value.
*        This standard deviation may be derived from the variances in the 
*        input data file, or from the variances estimated from the spread
*        of data values. If many input values are rejected at a particular 
*        pixel it may indicate an entirely corrupt pixel, in which case you 
*        may want to ignore the pixel altogether by setting it bad in the 
*        output cube. This can be done using parameter MINFRAC.
*
*        After rejecting such values, the algorithm goes on to re-calculate 
*        the Stokes vectors excluding the rejected input values, weighting
*        the input data values as specified by parameter WEIGHTS. This 
*        process is repeated a number of times given by parameters TOLR
*        and MAXIT.
*
*        There are a couple of restrictions in single-beam mode. Firstly,
*        there is currently no facility for measuring circular
*        polarization. Secondly, no attempt is made to correct for
*        difference in the exposure times of the input images, which
*        should all have been normalised to the same exposure time.

*  The Dual-beam Algorithm:
*        In dual-beam mode, Q and U are estimated by taking the difference
*        between pairs of orthogonally polarized images (i.e. the O and E
*        ray images extracted from a single dual-beam image). The total
*        intensity I is estimated by summing such pairs of images. The
*        various estimates of these quantities provided by different pairs 
*        are stacked together using a median estimator to provide some
*        safe-guards against aberrant input values. Circular polarization
*        can also be measured.
*
*        Only polarimeters with a fixed analyser and rotating half-wave plate
*        are supported, and the half-wave plate angle (given by item
*        WPLATE in the POLPACK extension of each input image) must be one
*        of 0, 22.5, 45 and 67.5 degrees. Other values cause the
*        application to abort.
*
*        If input images for all four half-wave plate positions are
*        provided (0, 22.5, 45 and 67.5 degrees) then a correction is
*        made for any difference in sensitivity of the two channels (such
*        as can be caused by the use of polarized flat-field for
*        instance). This correction is known as the "F-factor" and is
*        based on the redundancy provided by using four half-wave plate
*        positions. If images with the required half-wave plate positions
*        are not provided, then it is assumed that the two channels are
*        equally sensitive (that is, an F-factor of 1.0 is used).
*
*        Corrections are also made for any difference in exposure times
*        for the supplied intensity images. These are based on the fact
*        that the sum of the O and E ray intensities should always equal
*        the total intensity (after any F-factor correction), and should
*        therefore be the same for all pairs of corresponding O and E ray
*        images if they have equal exposure times.
*
*        The E and F factors are calculated by inter-comparing pairs of
*        intensity images to estimate their relative scale factor and
*        zero point. This estimation is an iterative process, and is
*        controlled by parameters TOLS, TOLZ, SKYSUP and MAXIT.

*  Examples:
*     polcal "*_O,*_E" stokes
*        This example uses all images in the current directory which have
*        file names ending with either "_O" or "_E", and stores the
*        corresponding I, Q and U values in the 3d cube "stokes". These
*        images contain dual-beam data (indicated by the presence of the
*        RAY item in the POLPACK extension), and so the dual-beam
*        algorithm is used.
*     polcal "*_O,*_E" stokes nodualbeam
*       As above, but the data is processed as if it were single beam data.

*  Notes:
*     -  An item named STOKES is added to the POLPACK extension. It is a
*     character string identifying the quantity stored in each plane of
*     the cube. For linear polarimetry, it is set to "IQU", and for
*     circular polarimetry it is set to "IV".
*     -  The reference direction for the Stokes vectors and polarization
*     vectors in the output NDF will be north if the first input NDF
*     has a celestial co-ordinate Frame within its WCS information. Otherwise, 
*     the reference direction will be the second pixel axis. The POLANAL
*     Frame in the WCS component of the output NDF is updated to describe
*     the new reference direction. Angles are always measured positive in the
*     same sense as rotation from the first image axis (X) to the second image
*     axis (Y) (this will be equivalent to rotation from north through 
*     east if the image has conventional WCS information).
*     -  WCS and AXIS components are propagated from the first supplied
*     input image to the output cube.

*  History:
*     28-JUL-1997 (TMG):
*        Original version.
*     15-MAY-1998 (DSB):
*        Prologue re-written.
*     02-JUN-1998 (TMG):
*        Added extra workspace array IPID to hold character identifiers
*     4-JUN-1998 (DSB):
*        Modified allocation of IPID workspace to include length of each
*        character identifier. Extended image identifiers from max of 10
*        characters to 30 characters. Modified call to POL_CALE to include
*        trailing length specifier for IPID strings.
*     8-FEB-1998 (DSB):
*        Added single beam mode.
