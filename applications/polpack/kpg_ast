*  Name:
*     KPG_AST

*  Purpose:
*     Define the KPG library AST common block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global variables include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of AST-related global variables used 
*     internally by the KPG library for things such as local communication 
*     between the KPG library and the "source" and "sink" routines used to 
*     read and write AST_ data from/to HDS objects, GRP groups, etc.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The DAT_PAR include file should be included prior to this file, in 
*     order to define constants which are needed here.
