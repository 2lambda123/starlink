\section{\xlabel{introduction}Introduction}
POLPACK is a package of applications for mapping the linear or circular
polarization of extended astronomical objects, using data obtained from a
dual-beam polarimeter\footnote{At the moment, Stokes vectors cannot be
produced for single-beam data. It is hoped that this restriction will be
removed at the next release.} It is assumed that the analyser is stepped
in units of 45\dgs\ and that there is no rotation between exposures.
Other assumptions regarding the specific form of the data or the
polarimeter have, as far as possible, been avoided.

POLPACK processes data in {\em NDF} format. This is the standard data
format used by most Starlink software, and is described fully in
\xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{}. However, other astronomical data formats may also
be processed using transparent on-the-fly data conversion facilities
provided by the NDF subroutine library. The use of these facilities is
described in \xref{SUN/55}{sun55}{}.

The facilities provided by POLPACK include:

\begin{itemize}
\item alignment of images on the sky.
\item extraction of $O$ and $E$ images from a single frame.
\item sky subtraction.
\item calculation of Stokes parameters.
\item binning of Stokes parameters.
\item creation of catalogues of polarization vectors.
\item graphical display of vector maps.
\end{itemize}

POLPACK does not provide facilities for performing instrumental
corrections such as flat-fielding, de-biassing, etc. Such corrections
should be applied to the data before using POLPACK, so that POLPACK can
assume that pixel values are proportional to the combined intensity of sky and
object. Some comments on how \xref{CCDPACK}{sun139}{} and
\xref{KAPPA}{sun95}{} may be used to perform these corrections can be found
\hyperref{here}{in section }{}{SEC:CCDPACK}. 

POLPACK can, however, apply certain corrections to the supplied data when
calculating Stokes parameters. These corrections take account of any
differences in the exposure times between raw frames, and any difference
in the sensitivity of the two channels of the dual-beam polarimeter. They
rely on redundancy in the supplied data, and require a specific set of
analyser positions to be used (described \hyperref{here}{in section }{}
{SEC:DETCOR}) when obtaining the data.

\section{\label{SEC:DBPOL}\xlabel{dualbeampolarimetry}Dual-beam Polarimetry}
This section gives a brief introduction to the general principles of
dual-beam polarimetry. It explains words and concepts used later, and
defines the data model used by POLPACK. A well established example of a
dual-beam polarimeter is described by Scarrott et al. ({\em Mon. Not. R.
astr. Soc.} (1983) {\bf 204}, 1163 - 1177).

\subsection{The Polarimeter}
A dual-beam polarimeter usually contains the following optical components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A focal-plane {\em mask}.
\item A {\em half-wave plate}.
\item An {\em analyser}.
\item A {\em detector}.
\end{enumerate}

The light collected by the telescope passes through these components in
the order listed (see Figure~\ref{fig:optical}). Each component is
described more fully below.

\begin{latexonly}
  \begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}

\end{latexonly}

   \caption{The main optical components in a typical dual-beam imaging polarimeter.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}

The heart of the polarimeter is the {\em analyser}, which splits incoming
partially plane polarized light up into two beams; one (called the
ordinary, or $O$ ray) contains the component of the incoming light
which is polarized parallel to the axis of the analyser, and the other
(called the extraordinary, or $E$ ray) contains the component of the
incoming light which is polarized orthogonally to the axis of the
analyser. These two beams are recorded simultaneously on a suitable
detector such as a CCD. The advantage of this system over a single-beam
instrument (in which only one state of polarization is recorded on a
given exposure), is that variations in sky background between exposures
affect both states of polarization equally, and so can be eliminated.

In an imaging polarimeter, the two beams form two images on the detector,
displaced by some distance determined by the design of the instrument;
both images representing the same area of the sky. A {\em masking system}
is used to prevent any overlap between the two images. In some
instruments this takes the form of a series of parallel, equally spaced
bars in the focal plane of the telescope (see Figure~\ref{fig:grids}). In
this case, the instrument is designed so that the displacement between
the two images formed by the $O$ and $E$ rays is perpendicular to the
bars, and equal in size to the width of a bar. Thus, the two images form
two inter-leaving sets of bars. There are several other systems (such as 
a mask containing only a single aperture), but the principle is the same.

If the incoming light is only partially polarized, then at least two
exposures are required to estimate both the degree and the orientation of
the polarization, each exposure recording the intensity in two orthogonal
states of polarization as described above. The analyser axis is rotated
in steps of 45\dgs\ between these exposures. In practice, physically rotating
the analyser would result in the displacement between the $O$ and
the $E$ ray images also rotating. This would cause the images to overlap
on the detector and would make the data reduction process much harder (if
not impossible). For this reason, the analyser is usually left in a fixed
position, and the plane of polarization of the incoming light is rotated
instead. This is achieved by placing a {\em half-wave plate} in
front of the analyser, and rotating it in steps of 22.5\dgs, resulting in
a rotation of the plane of polarization of 45\dgs. Using this scheme the
positions of the $O$ and $E$ ray images on the detector are unchanged.

The orientation of the plane of polarization of the incoming light is
measured relative to a fixed ``reference'' direction. The analyser axis
and the 0\dgs\ position of the half-wave plate are usually parallel to
this direction. 

\subsection{\label{SEC:OBS}\xlabel{theobservationalprocedure}The Observational Procedure}
At least two exposures are required to estimate the degree and
orientation of the polarization, taken with half-wave plate positions of
0\dgs\ and 22.5\dgs (see \hyperref{here}{appendix }{}{APP:POL}). For ease
of reference, these exposures are referred to here as $T_{0}$ and
$T_{22.5}$. The $O$ and $E$ ray images in $T_{0}$ measure the intensities
parallel and perpendicular to the reference direction. $T_{22.5}$ has an
effective analyser angle of 45\dgs\ (twice the half-wave plate angle) and
so measures the intensities at angles of 45\dgs\ and 135\dgs\ to the
reference direction

Ideally a further two exposures should be taken at half-wave plate
positions of 45\dgs\ and 67.5\dgs\ (referred to here as exposures
$T_{45}$ and $T_{67.5}$). These provide some redundancy in the data and 
enable internal consistency checks to be made during the data reduction
stage. 

These exposures are denoted by the letter $T$ to indicate that they are
{\em target} exposures. In addition to these target exposures, some {\em
flat-field} exposures are also required. These are used to correct for
any spatial variation in the sensitivity of the system, and consist of
exposures of a photometrically flat surface. Ideally, the flat-field
source should be unpolarized. However, if the additional target exposures
$T_{45}$ and $T_{67.5}$ are taken, then a constant polarization across
the flat-field source can be corrected for during data reduction.

Flat-field exposures should be taken at half-wave plate positions of
0\dgs\ and 22.5\dgs\, and are referred to here as exposures $L_{0}$ and 
$L_{22.5}$. {\em Note, flat-fields are not required for half-wave plate
positions 45\dgs\ and 67.5\dgs\ even if the additional target exposures
$T_{45}$ and $T_{67.5}$ are taken}. Further discussion of the flat-fielding
procedure is given \hyperref{here}{in section }{}{SEC:DETCOR}.

\subsection{The Data Reduction}
Several steps are involved in the production of a polarization map from
the raw exposures recorded by the detector. An over-view of these steps
is given here. Details of how they may be implemented in practice using
POLPACK are given in later sections of this document.

\subsubsection{\label{SEC:DETCOR}Corrections Related to the Detector}
These convert the raw data numbers measured by the detector into values
which are proportional to the combined sky and object intensity
transmitted by the analyser (plus noise of course). The details of these
corrections will depend on the nature of the detector. For a CCD camera,
they will usually involve at least flat-fielding, and de-biassing. 

Flat-fielding is worthy of some extra discussion, since it can be
complicated by the presence of the polarimeter in the light path. The
purpose of flat-fielding is to ensure that there are no spatial
variations in the sensitivity of the detector. This is normally achieved
by taking images of a photometrically flat surface such as the inside of
the observatory dome, or the twilight sky\footnote{In the near infra-red
flatfields are normally taken on the night sky which at these wavelengths
is bright enough to give a good signal to noise ratio.}. Since the
brightness of this surface is constant, any variations in the recorded
image (the ``flat-field'' image) must be due to variations in the
sensitivity of the detector. These variations can then removed from the
target observation by dividing every pixel value in the target image by
the corresponding pixel value in the flat-field image.

Introducing a polarimeter into the light path can complicate this if the
flat-field is taken in polarized light (such as produced by reflective
surfaces in the dome, or by light scattering in the atmosphere). In this
case the intensity of the light reaching the detector will not be
constant across the field, but will depend on the polarization. Also, if
the detector itself is intrinsically sensitive to the polarization of
the incident light, then this will introduce a difference in sensitivity
between the two channels.

If the polarization of the flat-field and the polarization-dependency 
of the detector are spatially constant, then the following method for
flat-field correction can be used so long as the additional target
exposures \hyperref{$T_{45}$ and $T_{67.5}$}{$T_{45}$ and $T_{67.5}$ 
(see section }{)}{SEC:OBS} are available:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Divide the two target exposures $T_{0}$ and $T_{45}$ by the flat-field
exposure $L_{0}$.

\item Divide the two target exposures $T_{22.5}$ and $T_{67.5}$ by the 
flat-field exposure $L_{22.5}$.

\end{enumerate}

If this procedure is followed, any constant polarization in the
flat-field source appears as a simple difference in sensitivity between
the two channels of the polarimeter (the ``F-factor''), which can be
estimated and corrected for when calculating the Stokes parameters.
A mathematical description of the flat-fielding and F-factor corrections
is given \hyperref{here}{in appendix }{}{APP:FFCOR}.

\subsubsection{Extraction of the $O$ and $E$ Ray Images}
Each exposure contains two images of the same area of the sky; the $O$
and the $E$ ray images. Once any detector corrections have been applied,
these images need to be identified and extracted into two separate arrays for
further processing.

\begin{latexonly}
  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{sun223_figures/extract.eps}
  \caption{Extraction of the $O$ and $E$ ray images.}

  \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\end{latexonly}

   \includegraphics[scale=0.8,width=8in]{sun223_figures/extract.eps}
   \caption{Extraction of the $O$ and $E$ ray images.}
   \end{figure}
   \end{quote}
\end{htmlonly}

\subsubsection{Image Alignment}
The arrays holding the extracted $O$ and $E$ ray images now need to be
aligned so that the same pixel in each array corresponds to the same
position on the sky. This can usually be achieved by aligning stars
within the arrays.

\subsubsection{Sky Subtraction}
The intensity of the background night sky now needs to be estimated and
subtracted from each of the aligned arrays. The sky may be polarized, and
so this needs to be performed independently within each of the aligned arrays.

\subsubsection{Estimation of the Stokes Parameters}
The {\em Stokes parameters} $I$, $Q$ and $U$ are all measures of intensity,
and together provide a useful description of the polarization of the object
being studied. Since $I$, $Q$ and $U$ all have the same units, this
description is generally easier to use than the more obvious description
given by the degree of polarization and the orientation of the plane of
polarization. The mathematical connection between the Stokes parameters 
and the sky-subtracted intensities is described \hyperref{here}{in
appendix }{}{APP:POL}. The output from this stage of the reduction process
is a {\em Stokes vector} (i.e. a set of $I$, $Q$ and $U$ values) for each
measured pixel on the sky.

\subsubsection{Binning of the Stokes Parameters}
One consequence of the fact that the Stokes parameters $I$, $Q$ and $U$
are all measures of intensity, is that they can be binned spatially. This
not only produces less confusing polarization maps (due to the reduced
number of measurements), but also improves the signal-to-noise ratio.

\subsubsection{Calculation of the Degree and Orientation of the Polarization}
The use of Stokes parameters to describe polarization has mathematical
advantages, but is not easy to represent in a graphical manner. For human
interpretation therefore, polarization is usually described by the degree
of polarization, $p$, (i.e. the ratio of polarized to total intensity),
and the orientation of the plane of polarization, $\theta$. Note,
$\theta$ is the angle between the plane of polarization and the reference
direction of the polarimeter. To convert this to a position angle on the
sky, the position angle of the reference direction must be known. The
simplest way to derive these parameters from the Stokes parameters is as
follows:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_{p} & = & \sqrt{ Q^{2} + U^{2} } \\
  p & = & I_{p}/I \\ \\
  \theta & = & 0.5.\arctan U/Q
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

where $I_{p}$ is the {\em polarized intensity}. However, the estimation
of $p$ is complicated by the non-symmetric statistics produced by squaring
and adding $Q$ and $U$. For low polarizations, this will tend to shift
the mean of the distribution of $p$ to higher values, thus resulting in
an over-estimation of $p$. The use of the following expression for $I_{p}$
reduces the effect of this statistical bias:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_{p} & = & \sqrt{ Q^{2} + U^{2} - \sigma^{2}} \\
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

where $\sigma^{2}$ is the variance on $Q$ or $U$ (which are assumed
equal). A description of the statistical behaviour of polarization
parameters is given by Serkowski ({\em Advances in Astronomy and
Astrophysics}, ed. Z. Kopal, Academic Press, New York, London (1962),
{\bf 1}, 304).

\subsubsection{Display of the Final Polarization Data}
The final polarization parameters are usually presented graphically in
the form of a {\em polarization map}. Each measurement is represented as
a vector parallel to the plane of polarization. The length of the vector
is proportional to the degree of polarization, which varies from 0\% to
100\%. The Stokes vectors can be binned to reduce the number of vectors
in the map to a manageable number. The map is often overlayed on a total
intensity image of the object to emphasize any correlation between the
visual appearance of the object and the morphology of the polarization
map.

\section{\xlabel{datareductionusingpolpack}Data Reduction Using POLPACK}


\section{\xlabel{startup}Starting up POLPACK}

The applications within POLPACK are made available from the C shell using the 
command:
\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% polpack
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

Note that the \text{\%} represents the C-shell prompt and should not be typed.
POLPACK is also available from the \xref{ICL}{sg5}{} command language.

\subsection{\xlabel{gettinghelp}Getting Help}

Help is available in several forms: 
\begin{itemize}
\item As simple text in the command-line window. Type:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% polhelp
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

Additional arguments may be given indicating the subject on which help is
required. For instance:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% polhelp polka parameters
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

will enter the help library at the point containing information on the
parameters available for application POLKA.

\item As hypertext in a separate browser window. Type:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% showme sun223
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

\item In response to prompts issued by applications for parameter values. 
Entering a single question mark will display help on the parameter being
prompted for, and then return you to the parameter prompt. Entering two
question marks also displays help on the parameter, but will leave you in the
help library, allowing you to navigate through any other necessary
topics. Leaving the help library returns you to the parameter prompt.

\item Additional information describing the detailed use of the POLKA
GUI is available from the {\em Help} menu within the GUI.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Running from the C-shell}
When using POLPACK from the C-shell (or any other shell) care needs to be
taken with some special characters. Wildcard characters \text{*,?,[a-z]},
quoted strings \text{""} and vector braces \text{[ ]} must be protected
by using either the escape character {\small \verb+\+} or by single
quotes (wildcard characters must be protected as these are expanded
internally by POLPACK, rather than by the shell).

\section{POLPACK's data format}
POLPACK uses data stored in the NDF format (the N-dimensional data
format (\xref{SUN/33}{sun33}{}), which is based on HDS,
the Hierarchical Data System \xref{(SUN/92)}{sun92}{}).
This is portable between the operating
systems that POLPACK runs on (Digital UNIX, Solaris and Linux at this time)
so it can be copied, accessed via NFS and ftp'd (using binary
transfer) between these systems. If your data is in another format you
will need to convert it to NDF. The CONVERT package
(\xref{SUN/55}{sun55}{}) contains many applications for doing this. The
KAPPA package (\xref{SUN/95}{sun95}{}) contains an application
\xref{FITSIN}{sun95}{FITSIN} that reads FITS tapes and writes the
results as NDFs.

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This application creates a new catalogue of polarization vectors by
      binning the Stokes vectors in the supplied catalogue. The input
      catalogue should contain columns with the same names and meanings
      as those produced by POLVEC. In particularly, the bin sizes are
      given as increments within the coordinate Frame implied by the
      columns with names {\tt "}X{\tt "} and {\tt "}Y{\tt "}. If the original catalogue was
      created by POLVEC, then {\tt "}X{\tt "} and {\tt "}Y{\tt "} will be pixel coordinates within
      the cube supplied as input to POLVEC.

      The bins used form a grid of equal sized rectangular cells, the
      dimensions of each cell being specified by the user. The grid contains
      sufficient cells to span the entire range of X and Y covered by the
      input catalogue. Each position in the output catalogue corresponds
      to one of these cells. The Stokes parameters for the cell are formed
      by combining together the Stokes parameter of all input positions
      which fall within the cell, using a method specified by the user.
      The degree of polarization, angle of polarization, and polarized
      intensity are then derived from these Stokes parameters. The (X,Y)
      positions in the output catalogue are the positions at the centre
      of each of the cells.

   \sstdescription{
      Calculate polarization parameters for dual-beam imaging
      polarimetry. This routine accesses a list of input NDF data
      structures which should contain processed polarimetric
      information. It is assumed that the input data are bias/dark
      corrected, flatfielded, sky subtracted and mutually aligned.

      Each input NDF should contain an image recorded in a
      single polarization state. The polarization state should be
      indicated by two descriptors WPLATE (the waveplate position, one of
      0.0,45.0,22.5,67.5) and RAY (either O (ordinary) or E
      (extraordinary)) which should reside in a POLPACK NDF extension.
      The descriptors are checked for validity and used to sort the
      input data into polarimetric sets. In addition, a third
      descriptor, IMGID, should be present to indicate which images were
      recorded on the same exposure.

      The input data files are first validated using the descriptor
      information in their POLPACK extensions. They are then sorted into
      sets that can be used to calculate the output polarization
      parameters.

      The instrumental polarization efficiency (F factor) is calculated
      by intercomparing images to calculate the scale factors and zero
      levels. All possible intercomparisons are used and a weighted mean
      F factor calculated.

      The time dependent efficiencies (E factors) due, for example, to
      changes in integration time or sky conditions between exposures,
      are calculated. The E factors are calculated by comparing total
      intensity images against an iteratively refined median image.

      The input data is `corrected{\tt '} by the polarization and time
      dependent efficiencies and the stokes images (I,Q,U) or (I,V) are
      calculated. The output stokes images are formed by median stacking
      all possible estimates.

      In LINEAR polarimetry mode the output NDF contains I, Q and U
      stokes images. In CIRCULAR polarimetry mode the output NDF
      contains I, V stokes images.

      occurs when it has either presented a screen{\tt '}s worth of text or
      has completed displaying the previously requested help.  The
      information displayed by POLHELP on a particular topic includes a
      description of the topic and a list of subtopics that further
      describe the topic.

      At a prompt you may enter:
         o  a topic and/or subtopic name(s) to display the help for that
            topic or subtopic, so for example, {\tt "}polka parameters dpi{\tt "}
            gives help on DPI, which is a subtopic of Parameters, which
            in turn is a subtopic of POLKA;

         o  a $<$CR$>$ to see more text at a {\tt "}Press RETURN to continue ...{\tt "}
            request;

         o  a $<$CR$>$\} at topic and subtopic prompts to move up one level
            in the hierarchy, and if you are at the top level it will
            terminate the help session;

         o  a CTRL/D (pressing the CTRL and D keys simultaneously) in
            response to any prompt will terminate the help session;

         o  a question mark {\tt "}?{\tt "} to redisplay the text for the current
            topic, including the list of topic or subtopic names; or

         o  an ellipsis {\tt "}...{\tt "} to display all the text below the
            current point in the hierarchy.  For example, {\tt "}POLKA...{\tt "}
            displays information on the POLKA topic as well as
            information on all the subtopics under POLKA.

      You can abbreviate any topic or subtopic using the following
      rules.

         o  Just give the first few characters, e.g. {\tt "}PARA{\tt "} for
            Parameters.

         o  Some topics are composed of several words separated by
            underscores.  Each word of the keyword may be abbreviated,
            e.g. {\tt "}Colour\_Set{\tt "} can be shortened to {\tt "}C\_S{\tt "}.

         o  The characters {\tt "}\%{\tt "} and {\tt "}$*${\tt "} act as wildcards, where the
            percent sign matches any single character, and asterisk
            matches any sequence of characters.  Thus to display
            information on all available topics, type an asterisk in
            reply to a prompt.

         o  If a word contains, but does end with an asterisk wildcard,
            it must not be truncated.

         o  The entered string must not contain leading or embedded
            spaces.

      Ambiguous abbreviations result in all matches being displayed.

   Stores information in the POLPACK extension
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine should be used to prepare data prior to processing
      with POLPACK. It records the values of various items of information
      required by POLPACK (wave-plate position, filter, etc) in the POLPACK
      extensions of the supplied NDFs. These values can either be supplied
      explicitly or can be copied ({\tt "}imported{\tt "}) from keywords stored in the
      FITS extensions of the supplied NDFs. Such keywords may, for instance,
      be provided by the instrument/telescope control systems.

      The import is controlled by a {\tt "}table{\tt "} which specifies how FITS
      keyword values should be used to create the corresponding POLPACK
      extension items. Each extension item may be assigned a specified
      constant value, the value of a specified FITS keyword, or the value
      of an arbitrary function of several FITS keywords.

      During the processing of data, POLPACK adds items to the POLPACK
      extension to indicate the state of the processing which has been
      applied to the data. This routine also allows values to be assigned
      to these extra extension items and thus can be used to import partially
      processed data. POLIMP can be used in conjunction with POLEXP to
      allow data to be moved backwards and forwards between POLPACK and
      other non-NDF based packages.

   \sstdiytopic{
      Table Format
   }{
      The import control (translation) table is an ordinary text file
      which contains instructions on how to assign values to the components
      of the POLPACK extension in an NDF. Constant values specified in
      the file may be used, or the values may be derived from the values
      of FITS keywords stored in the FITS extension of the NDF.

      In its most simple format each line in a FITS control table contains
      the name of a POLPACK extension item, followed by a constant value
      or FITS keyword. This causes the value of the specified FITS keyword
      or constant, to be assigned to the specified extension item. Some
      examples:

         ANGROT             ANROTA

      This copies the value of the FITS keyword ANROTA from the FITS
      extension to the ANGROT component in the POLPACK extension.

         ANGROT             45.0

      This assigns the value 45.0 to the ANGROT component of the POLPACK
      extension.

         IMGID              {\tt "}M51\_PLATEB{\tt "}

      This assigns the value M51\_PLATE to the IMGID component of the
      POLPACK extension. Note, textual constants must be enclosed within
      quotes.

      In addition to using the values of FITS keywords directly, it is also
      possible to use arbitrary functions of one or more keywords. To do
      this, each keyword used in the function must first be {\tt "}declared{\tt "} so
      that a data type may be associated with it. This is done by including
      lines with the following form in the control table prior to the
      function reference:

         Data-type          FITS-keyword

      Here {\tt "}Data-type{\tt "} must be one of \_INTEGER, \_REAL, \_DOUBLE, \_WORD, \_BYTE,
      \_CHAR. So for instance if you wanted to assign a value to the ANGROT
      extension item, the orientation of the analyser in degrees, from the
      FITS keyword ROTA which gives the required value in radians, you
      could use this sequence of commands:

         \_REAL             ROTA
         ANGROT            57.29578$*$ROTA

      The function may use any of the usual Fortran operators; $+$, -, $*$, /,
      $*$$*$ and built-in functions (SIN, COS, TAN, LOG, etc). See SUN/61
      (appendix A) for complete details.

      Characters strings cannot be manipulated by these functions so a single
      special format for translating their values is provided. The name
      of the destination extension item is given as usual followed by a
      FITS-keyword which supplies the string to be translated. This is then
      followed by statements which translate an {\tt "}input{\tt "} string into an
      {\tt "}output{\tt "} string. So for instance if you wanted to translate waveplate
      positions to the equivalent strings recognised by POLPACK you might
      use something like:

         WPLATE     WAVEPLT  A=0.0 -
                             B=22.5 -
                             C=45.0 -
                             D=67.5

      This does a case insensitive comparison between the value of the FITS
      keyword WAVEPLT and the strings on the left hand sides of the equals
      signs ({\tt "}A{\tt "}, {\tt "}B{\tt "}, etc), If a match is found, it assigns the value from
      the right hand side of the equals sign ({\tt "}0.0{\tt "}, {\tt "}22.5{\tt "}, etc, these
      are interpreted as strings, not numerical values) to the WPLATE
      component in the POLPACK extension. An error is reported if no match
      is found. The {\tt "}-{\tt "} signs at the end of each line indicate that the list
      continues on the next line. Note, if specified FITS keyword has a
      numerical value, then it is converted into textual form before doing
      the comparisons.

      If a control table contains more than one line for an extension
      item, then each line is processed in turn, replacing any value
      established by earlier lines. Thus the final value of the extension
      item will be given by the last line in the table refering to the
      extension item.

      If it is not known in advance if the FITS extension will contain the
      keyword values needed to assign a value to a particular POLPACK
      extension item, then a question mark may be appended to the name of
      the POLPACK extension item. If the required FITS keyword values
      cannot be found, then the error messages which would normally be
      issued are suppressed, and any remaining lines in the control table
      are processed as normal. If no value has been assigned to the item
      when the entire table has been processed, then the item will be set
      to its default value if it has one, or left undefined otherwise (see
      below). For instance:

         RAY?  OLDRAY
         RAY?  PPCKRAY

      causes the POLPACK extension item RAY to be assigned the value of the
      FITS keyword PPCKRAY if the keyword has a value in the FITS
      extension. If not, then the FITS keyword OLDRAY is used instead. If
      this does not exist either, then RAY is left undefined.

      Logical data types are restricted to a single keyword whose value
      must be {\tt "}YES{\tt "}, {\tt "}TRUE{\tt "}, {\tt "}T{\tt "}, {\tt "}Y{\tt "} for TRUE or {\tt "}NO{\tt "}, {\tt "}FALSE{\tt "}, {\tt "}N{\tt "},
      {\tt "}F{\tt "}.

      Fields in the table may be separated by commas if desired, any
      amount of white space and tabs are also allowed. Comments may be
      placed anywhere and should start with the characters {\tt "}\#{\tt "} or {\tt "}!{\tt "}.
      Continuation onto a new line is indicated by use of {\tt "}-{\tt "}.

   \sstdiytopic{
      POLPACK extension items
   }{
      The POLPACK extension of an NDF may contain the following items.
      The names and types of the extension items are those as used in
      import tables. Of these, ANGROT, FILTER, WPLATE and possibly IMGID
      are the only ones that most users need be concerned with. Values
      should be assigned to these extension items before processing of
      raw data commences. Their values will often be derived from FITS
      headers written by the instrument/telescope control system. Values
      for the remaining extension items are produced by POLPACK as the
      processing proceeds and need only be included in the control
      table if you are importing partially processed data.

      Some extension items have default values which are used if the
      control table does not specify a value for them. These are
      indicated in the descriptions below:

         ANGROT (\_REAL):  The anti-clockwise angle from the first axis of
         the image to the analyser position corresponding to WPLATE=0.0,
         in degrees. Defaults to 0.0.

         FILTER (\_CHAR):  The filter name. If a value is supplied, then
         the value of WPLATE is appended to it (unless the filter already
         includes the WPLATE value). This value is also copied to the FILTER
         item in the CCDPACK extension. Defaults to the value of WPLATE.

         IMGID (\_CHAR):  An arbitrary textual identifier for each input
         image, used to associate corresponding O and E ray images. It must
         be unique amongst the input images. Defaults to the name of the
         input image.

         RAY (\_CHAR):  This item should only be specified in the control
         table if the images being imported are partially processed images
         which have been split into separate O and E ray images. It
         identifies which ray the image is derived from, and can take the
         two values {\tt "}O{\tt "} and {\tt "}E{\tt "} (upper case). Left undefined by default.

         ROTATION (\_REAL):  This item should only be specified in the
         control table if the images being imported are partially processed
         images which have already been aligned. It is the clockwise
         rotation introduced into the image in order to align it with other
         images, in degrees. Left undefined by default.

         STOKES (\_CHAR):  This item should only be specified in the
         control table if the images being imported are partially processed
         images containing Stokes parameters. It is a string containing one
         character for each plane in the data array of the NDF. Each
         character identifies the quantity stored in the corresponding plane
         of the data array, and will be one of I, Q, U or V. Left
         undefined by default.

         WPLATE (\_CHAR):  The wave-plate position, in degrees. Must be one
         of; {\tt "}0.0{\tt "}, {\tt "}22.5{\tt "}, {\tt "}45.0{\tt "}, {\tt "}67.5{\tt "}. There is no default (an error
         is reported if no value is supplied).

         YROTATION (\_REAL): This item should only be specified in the
         control table if the images being imported are partially processed
         images which have already been aligned, and if the final map may
         contain shear. It gives the clockwise rotation in degrees of the
         Y axis introduced into the image in order to align it with other
         images. In this case the ROTATION item (see above) is understood
         as giving the rotation of the X axis. Left undefined by default.

   Extract and align O and E ray areas from a set of images
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This routine extracts and aligns areas containing corresponding rays
      from a set of images containing dual or single beam polarimetry data.
      It can also perform sky subtraction based either on a set of
      supplied sky frames, or on user-specified background areas within
      the object frames.

      In dual-beam mode, two output images are created for each
      supplied input image, one containing the O-ray areas and the other
      containing the E-ray areas from the corresponding input image. All
      output images are aligned pixel-for-pixel. In single-beam mode, only
      one output image is created for each input image.

      The mappings between rays and images are determined from a set of
      fiducial positions supplied by the user, using an integrated
      graphical user interface (GUI) which activates various applications
      from the KAPPA, CCDPACK and POLPACK packages. The same GUI is used to
      specify masks enclosing the O and E ray areas of each image (each mask
      comprises one or more polygonal areas). For each input image, the
      contents of the O-ray mask is copied to the corresponding {\tt "}O-ray{\tt "}
      output, and the contents of the E-ray mask is copied to the corresponding
      {\tt "}E-ray{\tt "} output. In single-beam mode only a single mask is used
      (notionally the {\tt "}O-ray{\tt "} mask), but the user has the option of not
      supplying any mask at all, in which case the whole input image is
      copied to the output.

      Various options controlling the behaviour of the GUI can be set on
      the command line by assigning values to the parameters listed below.
      Alternatively, they can be set using the {\tt "}Options{\tt "} menu in the menu
      bar at the top of the GUI. If not supplied on the command line, these
      parameters usually adopt the values they had on the previous
      invocation of Polka. The values shown in square brackets in the
      parameter descriptions below are the initial default values.

\section{\label{APP:POL}\xlabel{calculatingthepolarization}Calculating the Polarization}
This section gives a mathematical description of the calculation of the
degree and orientation of the polarisation, based on the observed
intensities. It is assumes that any required corrections (such as
flat-fielding, sky-subtraction, etc), have already been applied.

Each target exposure measures the components of the incoming light
polarized in two different orthogonal directions (depending on the
orientation of the half-wave plate). If the symbol $I_{\alpha}$ is used
to represent the intensity of the component polarized at an angle
$\alpha$ to the reference direction, then in each exposure the $O$ ray
image records $I_{\alpha}$ and the $E$ ray image records $I_{\alpha+90}$.

The first exposure ($T_{0}$) is taken with the half-wave plate in its 0\dgs\
position. The $O$ ray image will then record the intensity $I_{0}$ and
the $E$ ray image will record the intensity $I_{90}$. Malus' law gives
these intensities as:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_{0} & = & I_{p}.\cos^{2}\theta + \frac{I_{u}}{2} \\
 I_{90} & = & I_{p}.\cos^{2}(90 - \theta) + \frac{I_{u}}{2} \\
        & = & I_{p}.\sin^{2}\theta + \frac{I_{u}}{2}
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

Here, $I_{p}$ and $I_{u}$ are the polarized and unpolarized intensities
in the incoming light, and $\theta$ is the angle between the plane of
polarization and the reference direction (i.e. the 0\dgs\ position). The
total intensity $I$ is the sum of $I_{p}$ and $I_{u}$, and can be found
as follows:
\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_{0} + I_{90} & = & I_{p}.(\cos^{2}\theta + \sin^{2}\theta) + I_{u} \\
                 & = & I_{p} + I_{u} \\
                 & = & I
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

Thus, summing the $O$ and the $E$ ray images gives the total intensity
image. 

The half-wave plate is now rotated by 22.5\dgs\ and another exposure
($T_{22.5}$) is taken. Rotating the half-wave plate by 22.5\dgs\ is
equivalent to rotating the analyser by 45\dgs, and so the $O$ and $E$ ray
images now record the intensities $I_{45}$ and $I_{135}$, where:
\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_{45} & = & I_{p}.\cos^{2}(45 - \theta) + \frac{I_{u}}{2} \\
 I_{135} & = & I_{p}.\cos^{2}(135 - \theta) + \frac{I_{u}}{2} \\
         & = & I_{p}.\sin^{2}(45 - \theta) + \frac{I_{u}}{2}
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

Again, the sum of the $O$ and $E$ ray intensities ($I_{45}+I_{135}$)
gives the total intensity $I$. 

The mathematical description of polarization can be simplified by using 
the quantities $Q$ and $U$ defined as:
\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  Q & = & I_{p}.\cos 2\theta \\
  U & = & I_{p}.\sin 2\theta \\
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

Together with the total intensity, $I$, these quantities are known as 
{\em Stokes parameters}\footnote{There is a fourth Stokes parameter, $V$, which is
always zero for linearly polarized light, but is non-zero for circularly
polarized light.}. Using these definitions, the polarized intensity, $I_{p}$, 
is:
\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_{p} & = & \sqrt{ Q^{2} + U^{2} }
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

and the orientation of the plane of polarization is:
\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \theta & = & 0.5.\arctan U/Q
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

The degree of polarization, $p$, is the ratio of polarized to total
intensity, $I_{p}/I$. Using the expressions for $I_{0}$ and $I_{90}$
above, it can be seen that:
\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_{0} - I_{90} & = & I_{p}.\cos^{2}\theta - I_{p}.\sin^{2}\theta \\
                 & = & I_{p}.\cos 2\theta \\
                 & = & Q
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

Likewise,
\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_{45} - I_{135} & = & I_{p}.\cos^{2}(45 - \theta) - I_{p}.\sin^{2}(45 - \theta) \\
                   & = & I_{p}.\cos 2.(45 - \theta) \\
                   & = & I_{p}.\cos (90 - 2\theta) \\
                   & = & I_{p}.\sin 2\theta \\
                   & = & U
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

Thus, using the four intensities $I_{0}$, $I_{45}$, $I_{90}$ and $I_{135}$
(obtained on two exposures with half-wave plate positions 0\dgs\ and
45\dgs), both $Q$ and $U$ can be found, together with two
independent estimates of $I$. This allows the polarized intensity, the
degree of polarization and the orientation of the plane of polarization to
be found using only two exposures. However, it is usually advisable to
obtain additional exposures at half-wave plate positions of 45\dgs\ and
67.5\dgs\ in order to correct for any difference in the sensitivity of
the two channels of the polarimeter (such as may be produced for instance
by a polarised flat-field).

\section{\label{APP:FFCOR}\xlabel{flatfieldcorrectionsandtheFFactor}Flat-field
          Corrections and the F-Factor}
This section describes the flat-fielding process and F-factor correction
in mathematical terms.

Let the intensity in the $O$ and $E$ beams transmitted by the analyser be
$I_{o}(\alpha)$ and $I_{e}(\alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is the effective 
analyser angle (i.e. twice the half-wave plate rotation angle).
\hyperref{Malus' law}{Malus' law (see appendix }{)}{APP:POL} gives:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_{o}(\alpha) & = & I_{p}.\cos^{2}( \alpha - \theta ) + \frac{I_{u}}{2} \\
  I_{e}(\alpha) & = & I_{p}.\sin^{2}( \alpha - \theta ) + \frac{I_{u}}{2} 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

where $I_{p}$ is the polarized intensity, $I_{u}$ is the unpolarized
intensity, and $\theta$ is the angle between the plane of polarization
and the reference direction. 

The signals measured by the detector (before flat-fielding) are:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  M_{o}(\alpha) & = & S_{o}.I_{o}(\alpha) \\
  M_{e}(\alpha) & = & S_{e}.I_{e}(\alpha) 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

where $S_{o}$ and $S_{e}$ are the sensitivities of the detector to the $O$ 
and $E$ rays. These are independent of $\alpha$, but vary across the
detector.

For target exposure $T_{0}$ (for which $\alpha$ is zero), the transmitted
intensities are denoted as $I^{t}_{o}(0)$ and $I^{t}_{e}(0)$ and the
measured intensities as $M^{t}_{o}(0)$ and $M^{t}_{e}(0)$. For flat-field
exposure $L_{0}$, the transmitted intensities are denoted as
$I^{l}_{o}(0)$ and $I^{l}_{e}(0)$ and the measured intensities as
$M^{l}_{o}(0)$ and $M^{l}_{e}(0)$. The actual flat-field intensities are
assumed to be spatially constant, but the measured intensities will
reflect any variation in $S_{o}$ and $S_{e}$.

Target exposure $T_{0}$ is flat-fielded by dividing it by the flat-field
exposure with the same value of $\alpha$ (i.e. $L_{0}$) . Thus, the
measured intensities after the flat-field correction ($M^{c}_{o}(0)$ and
$M^{c}_{e}(0)$) are:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  M^{c}_{o}(0) & = & M^{t}_{o}(0) / M^{l}_{o}(0) \\
                    & = & \frac{ S_{o}.I^{t}_{o}(0) }{ S_{o}.I^{l}_{o}(0) } \\
                    & = & \frac{ I^{t}_{o}(0) }{ I^{l}_{o}(0) } \\ \\
  M^{c}_{e}(0) & = & M^{t}_{e}(0) / M^{l}_{e}(0) \\
                    & = & \frac{ S_{e}.I^{t}_{e}(0) }{ S_{e}.I^{l}_{e}(0) } \\
                    & = & \frac{ I^{t}_{e}(0) }{ I^{l}_{e}(0) } 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

If the target exposure $T_{45}$ is taken with an analyser angle 
of 90\dgs\ (accomplished by rotating the half-wave plate by 45\dgs), then
the $O$ and $E$ ray intensities are $I^{t}_{o}(90)$ and $I^{t}_{e}(90)$, where:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I^{t}_{o}(90) & = & I_{p}.\cos^{2}( 90 - \theta ) + \frac{I_{u}}{2} \\
                 & = & I_{p}.\sin^{2}( \theta ) + \frac{I_{u}}{2} \\
                 & = & I^{t}_{e}(0) \\ \\
  I^{t}_{e}(90) & = & I_{p}.\sin^{2}( 90 - \theta ) + \frac{I_{u}}{2} \\
                 & = & I_{p}.\cos^{2}( \theta ) + \frac{I_{u}}{2} \\
                 & = & I^{t}_{o}(0) 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

In other words, exposure $T_{45}$ records the same intensities as
exposure $T_{0}$, but swapped so that the $O$ ray becomes the
$E$ ray, and vice versa. The measured target intensities at this new
analyser angle are:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  M^{t}_{o}(90) & = & S_{o}.I^{t}_{o}(90) \\
                    & = & S_{o}.I^{t}_{e}(0) \\ \\
  M^{t}_{e}(90) & = & S_{e}.I^{t}_{e}(90) \\
                    & = & S_{e}.I^{t}_{o}(0) 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

These measured intensities are flat-fielded {\em using the flat-field
exposure for the original analyser angle {\em (0\dgs)}, NOT the new angle
{\em (90\dgs)}}. Thus:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  M^{c}_{o}(90) & = & M^{t}_{o}(90) / M^{l}_{o}(0) \\
                & = & \frac{ S_{o}.I^{t}_{e}(0) }{ S_{o}.I^{l}_{o}(0) } \\
                & = & \frac{ I^{t}_{e}(0) }{ I^{l}_{o}(0) } \\ \\
  M^{c}_{e}(90) & = & M^{t}_{e}(90) / M^{l}_{e}(0) \\
                & = & \frac{ S_{e}.I^{t}_{o}(0) }{ S_{e}.I^{l}_{e}(0) } \\
                & = & \frac{ I^{t}_{o}(0) }{ I^{l}_{e}(0) } 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

To simplify the notation, put $i_{1}=M^{c}_{o}(0)$, $i_{2}=M^{c}_{e}(0)$,
$i_{5}=M^{c}_{o}(90)$ and $i_{6}=M^{c}_{e}(90)$. In other words, $i_{1}$ and
$i_{2}$ are the flat-fielded $O$ and $E$ ray intensities from exposure
$T_{0}$, and $i_{5}$ and $i_{6}$ are the corresponding intensities from
exposure $T_{45}$ ($i_{3}$, $i_{4}$, $i_{7}$ and $i_{8}$ are the
intensities from exposures $T_{22.5}$ and $T_{67.5}$). If both channels
of the polarimeter were equally sensitive, $i_{1}$ and $i_{6}$ would be
equal, as would $i_{2}$ and $i_{5}$. In reality, the ratios of these
quantities give two estimates of the relative sensitivity of the two
channels:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \frac{i_{6}}{i_{1}} & = & \frac{ I^{t}_{o}(0)/I^{l}_{e}(0) }

                      & = & \frac{ I^{l}_{o}(0) }{ I^{l}_{e}(0) } \\ \\
  \frac{i_{2}}{i_{5}} & = & \frac{ I^{t}_{e}(0)/I^{l}_{e}(0) } 
                                 { I^{t}_{e}(0)/I^{l}_{o}(0) } \\
                      & = & \frac{ I^{l}_{o}(0) }{ I^{l}_{e}(0) }

This ratio ($I^{l}_{o}(0)/I^{l}_{e}(0)$) is known as the ``F-factor'' and
is constant (since the polarization of the flat-field surface was assumed
to be constant). The intensities $i_{1}$ and $i_{5}$ can be normalized
using $F$ to correct for the difference in sensitivity of the two channels:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  i_{1}.F & = & \frac{ I^{t}_{o}(0) }{ I^{l}_{o}(0) }.
                \frac{ I^{l}_{o}(0) }{ I^{l}_{e}(0 } \\
          & = & \frac{ I^{t}_{o}(0) }{ I^{l}_{e}(0) } \\ \\
  i_{5}.F & = & \frac{ I^{t}_{e}(0) }{ I^{l}_{o}(0) }.
                \frac{ I^{l}_{o}(0) }{ I^{l}_{e}(0 } \\
          & = & \frac{ I^{t}_{e}(0) }{ I^{l}_{e}(0) } 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}

Thus $i_{1}.F$, $i_{2}$, $i_{5}.F$ and $i_{6}$ all have the same 
constant of proportionality ($1/I^{l}_{e}(0)$) and can be used as 
normalized estimates of the $O$ and $E$ ray intensities for exposures
$T_{0}$ and $T_{45}$.

The target exposures $T_{22.5}$ and $T_{67.5}$ are required, together
with the flat-field exposure $L_{22.5}$, to estimate the degree and
orientation of the polarization. If, after flat-fielding using the above 
process, these target exposures give $O$ and $E$ intensities $i_{3}$, 
$i_{4}$, $i_{7}$, and $i_{8}$, then they give two more estimates of $F$.
In practice the geometric mean of all four estimates is used:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  F & = & [(i_{6}/i_{1})(i_{2}/i_{5})(i_{8}/i_{3})(i_{4}/i_{7})]^{1/4}
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{myquote}
