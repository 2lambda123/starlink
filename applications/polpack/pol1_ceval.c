*  Name:
*     POL1_CEVAL

*  Purpose:
*     Evaluate an import control table expression as a character function.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C (callable from Fortran 77)

*  Invocation:
*     CALL POL1_CEVAL( EXPR, FCHAN, IGRP1, IGRP2, VALUE, OK, STATUS )

*  Description:
*   This routine evaluates an import control table expression as a 
*   character function.

*  Arguments:
*     EXPR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The expression.
*     FCHAN = INTEGER (Given)
*        An AST FitsChan containing the FITS header cards to be used when
*        resolving references to FITS keywords contained in EXPR.
*     IGRP1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for a group holding HDS data types. Ignored
*        if either IGRP1 or IGRP2 is GRP__NOID.
*     IGRP2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        A GRP identifier for a group holding FITS keyword names. Ignored
*        if either IGRP1 or IGRP2 is GRP__NOID.
*     VALUE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The expression value. Set blank if OK is .FALSE.
*     OK = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Was the supplied expression a character function? If not, it
*        must be a numerical function. This flag is returned .TRUE. even
*        if there were references to undefined FITS keywords within the 
*        expression. It is returned .FALSE. only if there were no
*        character operators within the string ("//", "=", quotes,
*        backslashes), and the expression contained one or more characters 
*        which are not legal within a FITS keyword name.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status. A value of SAI__WARN is returned iff any 
*        undefined FITS keywords are referenced within the expression.

*  Notes:
*     -  To be a character function the supplied expression must have the 
*     following form:
*     
*        term [ // term ] [// term ] ...
*
*     The terms in this expression are concatenated together. A "term" has 
*     the following form:
*
*        value [ literal = literal ] [ literal = literal ] ...
*
*     If the value equals any of the left hand literals, then the value
*     is replaced by the corresponding right hand literal. Note, commas
*     may be used as delimiters in place of spaces. A value has the
*     following form:
*
*        string | name
*
*     and a literal has the following form:
*
*        string | word
*
*     A string is any text enclosed in matching single or double quotes.
*     quotes within these strings can be escaped by a backslash character
*     "\".
*
*     A name is the name of a known FITS keywords (i.e. a KEYWORD which
*     has a defined value in the supplied FItsChan). An error is reported
*     if the FITS keyword is not of type _CHAR (either because it has been
*     explicitly declared as _CHAR in IGRP1 and IGRP2, or because its
*     natural FITS type is _CHAR). The only exception to this is that no
*     error is reported if the expression consists of just the keyword
*     name. In this case a blank VALUE is returned with OK = .FALSE., but
*     no error is reported.
*
*     A word is any text which does not include any of the following:
*       - spaces
*       - equal signs 
*       - single quotes
*       - double quotes
*       - adjacent slashes (/)

/*
*  Name:
*     pol1Teval

*  Purpose:
*     Evaluate a term of an import control table character expression.

*  Language:

*  Synopsis:
*     int pol1Teval( unsigned char *t0, unsigned char *t1, AstFitsChan *fchan, 
*                    int igrp1, int igrp2, char **v, char *vl, int *status )

*  Description:
*   This routine evaluates a single term of an expression. A term has the
*   form:
*           value [literal1=literal2] [literal1=literal2] ...
*
*   where "value" can be:
*      - A quoted string.
*      - A FITS keyword name
*      - An entire expression in parentheses.
*
*   and the literals can be:
*      - A quoted string
*      - A single literal word with no spaces, or other control characters
*      - An entire expression in parentheses.
*
*   The string to which "value" evaluates is compared with each of the
*   "literal1" strings (case insensitive). If a match is found, the
*   corresponding literal2 value is stored at *v. If no match is found,
*   the original value is returned at *v.

*  Arguments:
*     e0 
*        Pointer to the first character of the expression.
*     e1
*        Pointer to the first character beyond the end of the expression.
*     fchan
*        A pointer to an AST FitsChan containing the FITS header cards to 
*        be used when resolving references to FITS keywords contained in
*        the expression.
*     igrp1 
*        A GRP identifier for a group holding HDS data types. Ignored
*        if either igrp1 or igrp2 is GRP__NOID.
*     igrp1
*        A GRP identifier for a group holding FITS keyword names. Ignored
*        if either igrp1 or igrp2 is GRP__NOID.
*     v 
*        Address of a pointer to the start of the string to receive the string
*        corresponding to the expression. The pointer is updated on exit
*        to hold the address of the next character following the end of
*        the string.
*     vl
*        Pointer to the end of the string to receive the string
*        corresponding to the expression. The string should not be null
*        terminated.
*     status 
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*        Was the first value in the term made up exclusively of
*        characters which are legal in the context of a FITS keyword name?

*     identical, except for case in order to match.

*  Parameters:
*     a1 
*        A pointer to the first character beyond the end of the A string.
*     a0 
*        A pointer to the first character of the A string.
