#  Globals:
#     CAN (Read)
#        Path to the canvas containing the GWM image display.
#     CUROBJ_DISP (Read)
#        The type of the current objects displayed.
#     IMAGE_DISP (Read)
#        The displayed image (without section).
#     PNTCX (Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas X coordinates. 
#     PNTCY (Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas Y coordinates. 
#     PNTID (Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas item identifiers associated with the
#        positions in the list. A value of -1 indicates that no marker is
#        currently drawn for the position.
#     PNTLBL (Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of labels associated with the positions in the list. 
#     RECALC_OEMAP (Write)
#        A 1-d array indexed by image. Each element is a logical flag 
#        indicating if the image features for the corresponding image 
#        have changed since the image's E to O mapping was last found.
#     RECALC_IMMAP (Write)
#        A 1-d array indexed by image. Each element is a logical flag 
#        indicating if the image features for the corresponding image 
#        have changed since the mapping from the image to the first
#        (reference) image was last found. The flag is set for all

#        are changed.
#     PNTNXT (Read)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of integers representing indices within the lists 
#        given by PNTxxx. Each integer gives the index of the next position
#        along the edge of a polygon. The vector starting at position
#        index i, ends at position index given by the i'th element of
#        PNTNXT. If this value is blank ("") then position i is not part of
#        a polygon. If this value is -1, then the end of the vector starting
#        position i is unspecified (in this case the polygon is not
#        closed).
#     PNTPX (Read)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of pixel X coordinates. 
#     PNTPY (Read)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of pixel Y coordinates.

#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas tags (one for each position).
#     PNTVID (Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas item identifiers associated with the
#        vectors between positions in the list. A value of -1 indicates that 
#        no line is currently drawn for the position. A blank string
#        indicates that no vector is defined.
#     V0 (Read and Write)
#        The index of the position corresponding to the first vertex in
#        an incomplete (i.e. open) polygon.
#     V1 (Read and Write)
#        The index of the position corresponding to the last vertex in
#        an incomplete (i.e. open) polygon.
#     VCX0 (Write)
#        The canvas X coordinates at the first vertex in an incomplete 
#        (i.e. open) polygon.
#     VCY0 (Write)
#        The canvas Y coordinates at the first vertex in an incomplete 
#        (i.e. open) polygon.

#        along the edge of a polygon. The vector starting at position
#        index i, ends at position index given by the i'th element of
#        PNTNXT. If this value is blank ("") then position i is not part of

#     PNTVID (Read and Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas item identifiers associated with the
#        vectors between positions in the list. A value of -1 indicates that 
#        no line is currently drawn for the position. A blank string
#        indicates that no vector is defined.
#     V0 (Write)
#        The index of the position corresponding to the first vertex in

#        The label of the entry from the Effects menu which was pressed.

#        If this is non-zero then the results of the effect are not
#        displayed.
#
#  Globals:
#     EFFECTS_MAPPINGS (Read and Write)
#        A 1-d array, indexed by image name. Each element is a list 
#        in which each entry gives the mapping introduced by the
#        corresponding effect. This mapping goes from pixel coords in
#        the previous top entry in the effects stack to the new top entry.
#        There is no entry for the supplied image (i.e. the number of
#        entries in this stack is the same as EFFECTS_STACK, i.e. one less 
#        than in IMAGE_STACK). Each mapping is described by a list of 6 
#        values giving the parameters of a full 2-D linear fit.
#     EFFECTS_STACK (Read and Write)
#        A 1-d array, indexed by image name. Each element is a list 
#        containing textual descriptions of the effects applied to the
#        image. These descriptions correspond to the images in the 
#        correspsonding element of the IMAGE_STACK list (except that the
#        original image - stored at the bottom of the IMAGE_STACK - does not 
#        have a description).
#     FILLCON (Read and Write)
#        Set to "Variable value" if the Fill effect should fill bad pixels
#        using a varying value (KAPPA:FILLBAD). Set to "Constant value" if
#        a constant value (given by FILLVAL) should be used (KAPPA:NOMAGIC).
#     FILLVAL  (Read and Write)
#        The constant value with which the Fill effect should fill bad pixels.
#     FSIZE (Read and Write)
#        The filter size for the Filter effect (in pixels).
#     IMAGE_STACK (Read and Write)
#        A 1-d array index by image name. Each element is a list of file
#        names holding the result of each effect. Each effect operates on
#        images on the top of this stack, and results in a new image being
#        pushed onto the stack. The name of the supplied image section is 
#        pre-loaded onto the stack, and is never removed (the Undo and Undo 
#        All effects are disabled if the only image left on the stack is the 
#        original image). 
#     MEXP (Read and Write)
#        The expression used by the Maths effect.
#     PSF_SIZE (Read)
#        The feature size specified by the user.
#     SCAHIGH (Read)
#        The data value corresponding to white in the displayed image.
#     SCALOW (Read)
#        The data value corresponding to black in the displayed image.
#     SKYOFF (Read)
#        Should sky subtraction be performed? If not, then the input image
#        name is returned unchanged.
#     SSIZE (Read and Write)
#        The FWHM of the gaussian used by the Smooth effect (in pixels).
#     THRBAD (Read and Write)
#        Should the Threshold effect replace out-of-bounds pixels with
#        bad values? Otherwise, they are replaced by the limit value.
#     THRHI  (Read and Write)
#        The upper threshold used by the Threshold effect.
#     THRLO  (Read and Write)
#        The lower threshold used by the Threshold effect.

#     nlabels
#        The name of a 1-D array indexed by variable name, holding the labels 
#        to display next to each entry box. These may be blank if no label is required.
#     nlimits
#        The name of a 1-D array indexed by variable name. Each element is a 
#        list holding values which restrict the values which can be taken by
#        the corresponding variable. For _REAL and _INEGER, the first item 
#        in the list is the minimum allowed value, and the second is the 
#        maximum allowed value. If not supplied, no limits are imposed. For
#        _CHOICE, the items in the list are the allowed string values for the

#     all images). No errors are reported if the mapping cannot be created
#     due to lack of image features.
#
#  Arguments:
#     image
#        The name of the image.
#     args
#        An optional argument which should only be set if this procedure
#        was called recursively from within itself. It is used to prevent
#        infinite recursion.
#
#  Returned Value:
#     A list of 6 parameter values describing the linear mapping.
#
#  Globals:
#     E_RAY_FEATURES (Read)
#        An integer representing the "E-ray features" object type.
#     MAPTYPE (Read)
#        A list containing the textual descriptions of the available 
#        mapping types.
#     OEFITTYPE (Read)
#        A textual description of the mapping to be used for the OE mapping.
#     OEMAP (Read and Write)
#       An array of mappings (one for each image), each being a list of
#       6 parameter values.
#     O_RAY_FEATURES (Read)
#        An integer representing the "O-ray features" object type.
#     PNTLBL (Read)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of labels associated with the positions in the list. 
#     PNTPX (Read)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of pixel X coordinates. 
#     PNTPY (Read)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of pixel Y coordinates. 
#     PROT_OEMAP (Read and Write)
#        A 1-d array indexed by image. Each element is either "normal" or
#        "disabled", and specified whether the OE mapping associated
#        with the image may be changed. A value of "normal" means that the
#        mapping may be changed; a value of "disabled" means that it 
#        may not be changed.
#     RECALC_OEMAP (Read and Write)
#        A 1-d array indexed by image. Each element is a logical flag 
#        indicating if the image features for the corresponding image 
#        have changed since the image's E to O mapping was last found.

#        name is returned unchanged.
#     SKY_AREA (Read)
#        One of the integer values which may be assigned to SKY_METHOD:
#        indicates that sky background is to be performed by fitting

#        O and E sky areas).
#     SKY_METHOD (Read)
#        The sky subtraction method to use; $SKY_AREA or $SKY_FRAME. Any
#        other value results in no sky subtraction being performed (in which
#        case the supplied input data is simply copied to the output).
#     STKOUT (Read)

#+
#  Name:
#     SetPosn
#
#  Purpose:
#     Set parameter values for a position. Any displayed canvas items
#     associated with the position are modified accordingly.
#
#  Arguments:
#     i
#        The index (zero-based) of the position for which information
#        is to be set. If this is supplied as -1, then a new position is 
#        appended to the end of the list.
#     names
#        A list of the names of the parameters to be set. These should be
#        taken from:
#           PX - The pixel X coordinate of the position.
#           PY - The pixel Y coordinate of the position.
#           CX - The canvas X coordinate of the position.
#           CY - The canvas Y coordinate of the position.
#           ID - The canvas item id of the marker for the position (-1
#                if no marker is currently drawn).
#           VID - The canvas item id of the line joining the position to
#                the position given by parameter NXT (-1 if no line is 
#                currently drawn, and null ("") if NXT is undefined).
#           NXT - The index of the position corresponding to the next 
#                vertex in a polygonal mask (-1 if there is no "next
#                vertex" (i.e. if the polygon is open) and null ("") if this 
#                position is not part of a polygon). 
#           LBL - The textual label associated with a position.
#           TAG - A canvas tag associated with the position.
#     values
#        A list of parameter values corresponding to the names in "names".
#     args
#        An optional list argument holding the image from which the 
#        positions are derived, and the type of objects to be used.
#        If these are not supplied, they default to $IMAGE_DISP and
#        $CUROBJ_DISP.
#
#  Returned Value:
#     The index of the set position. A null string is returned if the
#     supplied index is out of bounds.
#     
#  Globals:
#     CAN (Read)
#        Path to the canvas containing the GWM image display.
#     CUROBJ_DISP (Read)
#        The type of the current objects displayed.
#     IMAGE_DISP (Read)
#        The displayed image (without section).
#     PNTCX (Read and Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas X coordinates. 
#     PNTCY (Read and Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas Y coordinates. 
#     PNTID (Read and Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas item identifiers associated with the
#        positions in the list. A value of -1 indicates that no marker is
#        currently drawn for the position.
#     RECALC_OEMAP (Write)
#        A 1-d array indexed by image. Each element is a logical flag 
#        indicating if the image features for the corresponding image 
#        have changed since the image's E to O mapping was last found.
#     RECALC_IMMAP (Write)
#        A 1-d array indexed by image. Each element is a logical flag 
#        indicating if the image features for the corresponding image 
#        have changed since the mapping from the image to the first
#        (reference) image was last found. The flag is set for all
#        images if the image features for the first (reference) image
#        are changed.
#     PNTNXT (Read and Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of integers representing indices within the lists 
#        given by PNTxxx. Each integer gives the index of the next position
#        along the edge of a polygon. The vector starting at position
#        index i, ends at position index given by the i'th element of
#        PNTNXT. If this value is blank ("") then position i is not part of
#        a polygon. If this value is -1, then the end of the vector starting
#        position i is unspecified (in this case the polygon is not
#        closed).
#     PNTPX (Read and Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of pixel X coordinates. 
#     PNTPY (Read and Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of pixel Y coordinates. 
#     PNTTAG (Read)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas tags (one for each position).
#     PNTVID (Read and Write)
#        A 2-d array indexed by image and object type. Each element
#        is a list of canvas item identifiers associated with the
#        vectors between positions in the list. A value of -1 indicates that 
#        no line is currently drawn for the position. A blank string
#        indicates that no vector is defined.
#     V0 (Read)
#        The index of the position corresponding to the first vertex in
#        an incomplete (i.e. open) polygon.
#     V1 (Read)
#        The index of the position corresponding to the last vertex in
#        an incomplete (i.e. open) polygon.
#     VCX0 (Write)
#        The canvas X coordinates at the first vertex in an incomplete 
#        (i.e. open) polygon.
#     VCY0 (Write)
#        The canvas Y coordinates at the first vertex in an incomplete 
#        (i.e. open) polygon.
#     VID2 (Write)
#        The canvas item id of the vector joining the last vertex in an
#        incomplete (i.e. open) polygon, to the pointer.
