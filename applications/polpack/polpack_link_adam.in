#  Name:
#     polpack_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against adam POLPACK.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building ADAM applications
#     which use POLPACK in order to generate the correct arguments for the
#     compiler (or ld) command. The arguments generated are written to
#     the standard output.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a makefile command to
#     create a monolith in Satrlink standard makefiles, thus:
#
#         $(ALINK) $(MONO_OBJECT) -o $(MONOLITH) $(OBJECT_LIBRARIES) \
#             -L$(STAR_LIB) `./polpack_link_adam`

#  History:
#     29-JUN-1997 (DSB):
#        Original version, based on ircampack_link_adam
#     28-JUL-2004 (TIMJ):
#        Add shl_link_adam
#     11-OCT-2004 (BRADC):
#        Added Tcl libraries.
#     20-SEP-2018 (DSB):
#        Use thr_link_adam instead of thr_link. Without this, AST does
#        not defer the delivery of error messages but writes them out
#        immediately.
