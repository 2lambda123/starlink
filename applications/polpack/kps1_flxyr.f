      SUBROUTINE KPS1_FLXYR( NAME, NVERT, IPX, IPY, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_FLXYR
 
*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a list of co-ordinates from a text file.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_FLXYR( NAME, NVERT, IPX, IPY, STATUS )
 
*  Description:
*     This routine obtains a list of 2-dimensional co-ordinates for a
*     series of positions by calling KPG1_FLCOR. Pointers to workspace 
*     containing the coordinates are returned. These pointers should be
*     released by calling PSX_FREE when they are no longer needed.
 
*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Name of the parameter with which to associate the text file.
*     NVERT = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The number of co-ordinate sets specified in the text file.
*     IPX = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to workspace of type _REAL and size NVERT
*        holding the X co-ordinates of each point.
*     IPY = INTEGER (Returned)
*        A pointer to workspace of type _REAL and size NVERT
*        holding the Y co-ordinates of each point.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
 
*  Notes:
*     -  This routine is just a wrap-up of KPG1_FLCOR to get round the
*     problems caused by the original version being removed from KAPPA.
*     -  The number of points read from the file is reported at the
*     normal reporting level.

*  Inherited Status:
      INTEGER STATUS

*  Local Variables:

*  Set up the columns in which the X and Y values are expected to be
*  stored. 
      POSCOD( 1 ) = 1
      POSCOD( 2 ) = 2

*  Call the genuine KAPPA routine to get the coordinate data. 
      CALL KPG1_FLCOR( NAME, 2, POSCOD, NVERT, IPXY, LBND, 
     :                 UBND, STATUS )

*  If any positions were given, get two work arrays to hold the x and 
*  y co-ordinates of the vertices.
      IF( NVERT .GT. 0 ) THEN
         CALL PSX_CALLOC( NVERT, '_REAL', IPX, STATUS )
         CALL PSX_CALLOC( NVERT, '_REAL', IPY, STATUS )

*  Split the 2-dimensional array into the x-y arrays.
         CALL KPG1_UNZ2R( NVERT, %VAL( IPXY ), %VAL( IPX ), %VAL( IPY ), 
     :                 STATUS )

*  Free the original array.
