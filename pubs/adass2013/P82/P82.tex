\begin{abstract}
  Although the Starlink Project was closed in 2005, Starlink software
  continues to be developed and supported by the Joint Astronomy
  Centre for its data-reduction requirements. This paper summarises
  new features added since the \textit{Kapuahi} release in 2012, with
  emphasis on the reduction of sub-millimetre data, illustrated with
  SCUBA-2 continuum images demonstrating improved fidelity, and
  STC-region support in the GAIA visualization tool.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The Starlink Software Collection is an open-source software project
hosted on github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Starlink}} that has
been in constant development since 1980 \citep{1982QJRAS..23..485D}.

\section{Main Changes since the Kapuahi Release}

The \textit{Hikianalia} release was made in April 2013. The key
changes relative to the previous \textit{Kapuahi} release
\citep{P05_adassxxii} and subsequent changes are detailed below.

\subsection*{64-bit Integer Support}

Data sets have continued to grow in size and the need for 64-bit
integers has become more important. The \textit{Herschel} telescope
generates data products with 64-bit integers and people attempted to
convert these files into Starlink NDF format \citep[see][for an
overview of NDF]{P91_adassxxiii}, with little success. Historically we
had been reticent regarding the addition of support for 64-bit
integers given varied Fortran compiler support for the
\texttt{INTEGER*8} data type and requiring C99 compilers for a
guaranteed 64-bit data type in C (\texttt{int64\_t}). With modern
compilers this is no longer an issue and type \texttt{\_INT64} was
added to the Starlink file format (HDS) and the application code
dealing with multiple types was consistently modified to use code
automatically generated by the \textsc{Generic} application. This
required that many generic source files were re-generated from the
derived files which had been committed during the switch to a unified
revision control system back in 2005 \citep{2005ASPC..347..119G}.

\subsection*{Application Updates}

Applications such as \textsc{Convert}, \textsc{Ccdpack} and
\textsc{KAPPA} all automatically received the ability to process data
with 64-bit integers.

\altsubsubsection*{GAIA}

A new toolbox was added for overlaying STC-S regions on an image.

\articlefigure[scale=0.4]{P82_f1.eps}{P82_F1}{Capture of GAIA
displaying an all-sky COBE image with the shown STC region overlaid.}

\altsubsubsection*{KAPPA}

Commands were added to report values of configuration parameters from
a text file (using the standard configuration format supported by the
\textsc{Grp} library) or NDF file history, and also to expand file lists.

Features were added to many commands including \textsc{beamfit},
\textsc{chanmap}, \textsc{collapse}, \textsc{display}, \textsc{mstats},
\textsc{normalize}, \textsc{parget}, \textsc{rotate}, \textsc{wcsadd},
and \textsc{wcsremove}.

\altsubsubsection*{SMURF}

The main focus of the \textit{Hikianalia} release was to support the
reduction of data from SCUBA-2
\citep{2013MNRAS.430.2545C,2013MNRAS.430.2513H}. In particular a new
approach to map-making was developed whereby all data are involved in
each iteration rather than iteratively processing small chunks and
coadding them all at the end.  An example of this so-called
\textit{Skyloop} is presented in Figure~\ref{P82_F2}.

\articlefiguretwo{P82_f2l}{P82_f2r}{P82_F2}{The
left panel shows an example reduction of a SCUBA-2 continuum image
without the Skyloop technique.  The right panel shows the same data
after application of Skyloop.  Notice many diffuse false-emission blooms
now disappear.}


\altsubsubsection*{POLPACK}

A new command \textsc{polrotref} has been added to rotate the
reference direction of a pair of $Q$ and $U$ images.

\altsubsubsection*{SPLAT}

Improved support for SSAP queries, with server grouping and new metadata
parameters \citep[see][for a protocol introduction]{2004SPIE.5493..262D}.

\subsection*{Library Updates}

\altsubsubsection*{AST}

The AST library \citep[see][and references
therein]{2012ASPC..461..825B} can now read FITS headers that use the
SAO convention for representing a distorted TAN projection, and can
now handle missing \texttt{CNPIX1} and \texttt{CNPIX2} keywords in DSS
headers. There were also modifications to flux conservation and
normalisation in the rebinning routines.

\altsubsubsection*{NDF}

The NDF library will now limit the maximum size of an NDF
section. There have also been efficiency improvements in the way that
provenance information is stored.

\subsection*{ORAC-DR}

ORAC-DR \citep{Cavanagh2008} is the object-oriented perl pipeline used
and developed at the Joint Astronomy Centre, but also used at other
observatories such as Las Cumbres and AAO for optical, infrared, and
sub-millimetre data reduction.

\altsubsubsection*{Heterodyne}

Further improvements to the detection of bad spectra
\citep{P61_adassxxii} include automatic emission detection or
user-defined regions to excise emission from non-linear baseline
detections, a filter to identify spectra with ringing (the same
oscillation pattern appears in varying strength over tens of
contiguous time series).  Different options are now available to
determine the receptor-to-receptor flat field.

The ACSIS/HARP pipeline can now process most data from the earlier DAS
backend, arising in part from better merging of hybrid data,
instrument-specific quality assurance criteria, and baseline
correction in line forests.

Although the goal is to provide high-quality results automatically for
the JCMT Science Archive, many new tailoring recipe parameters, such
as to control memory requirements and the creation of a
longitude-velocity image, have been added.

\altsubsubsection*{SCUBA-2 \& PICARD}

A number of data-quality analysis recipes have been added that allow
an assessment of the properties of SCUBA-2 data.
\begin{itemize}
\item Instrumental noise---This helps identify excessively noisy data that
can be excluded from the map-maker (\texttt{ASSESS\_DATA\_NOISE}).
\item Calibration consistency---Calculate flux-conversion factors and beam
sizes of standard sources to check calibration quality
(\texttt{SCUBA2\_CHECK\_CAL}).  This includes fitting of the source peak
for FCF calculations now attempts to fit two Gaussian components for high
(100) signal-to-noise ratio images of calibrators.
\item Output map noise---Calculate the noise and NEFD from the map,
compare with those derived from noise calculations and the SCUBA-2
integration-time calculator (\texttt{SCUBA2\_CHECK\_RMS}).  Calculate
the spatial power spectrum and determine noise power on scales up to a
high-pass filtering scale (\texttt{SCUBA2\_MAP\_PSPEC}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Documentation}

Documents are now created as PDFs instead of PostScript.
