% TEMPLATE.TEX -- APN3 (2003) ASP Conference Proceedings template.
%
% Derived from ADASS VIII (98) ASP Conference Proceedings template
% Updated by N. Manset for ADASS IX (99), F. Primini for ADASS 2000,
% D.Bohlender for ADASS 2001, and H. Payne for ADASS XII and LaTeX2e.
%
% Use this template to create your proceedings paper in LaTeX format
% by following the instructions given below.  Much of the input will
% be enclosed by braces (i.e., { }).  The percent sign, "%", denotes
% the start of a comment; text after it will be ignored by LaTeX.
% You might also notice in some of the examples below the use of "\ "
% after a period; this prevents LaTeX from interpreting the period as
% the end of a sentence and putting extra space after it.
%
% You should check your paper by processing it with LaTeX.  For
% details about how to run LaTeX as well as how to print out the User
% Guide, consult the README file.  You should also consult the sample
% LaTeX papers, sample1.tex and sample2.tex, for examples of including
% figures, html links, special symbols, and other advanced features.
%
% If you do not have access to the LaTeX software or a laser printer
% at your site, you can still prepare your paper following the
% instructions in the User Guide.  In such cases, the editors will
% process the file and make any necessary editorial adjustments.

\section{Changes to the Classic Starlink Software Collection}

The
\htmladdnormallink{Starlink Software Collection}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk}
has very recently been converted to use a build system based on GNU Autotools,
moved to a single CVS repository and re-licensed under the GPL. 
These are seen as key developments in the move to a more open strategy for
future support, and so that the whole system can be more easily ported to
Unix-like operating systems (in particular
\textsc{posix} systems which include an X~server).
The details of this work are described in Gray et al. (2005).  
Figure 1 shows some of our applications running under Mac\,OS\,X (similar screen
shots of Cygwin/Windows, Solaris and various flavours of Linux have been
omitted for space reasons).

\begin{figure}
\epsscale{0.8}\plotone{Draper_D-12_1.eps}
\caption{GAIA and KAPPA running under Mac\,OS\,X, a development recently made
possible by the introduction of a GNU Autotools-based build system.}
\end{figure}

\section{TOPCAT \& STIL, New Features}

Starlink \htmladdnormallink{TOPCAT}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat} 
is a user-friendly graphical program for viewing, analysing
and editing tables in many different formats. It is based on STIL --
the Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library -- a pure-Java class library for
accessing and manipulating astronomical tables. Recent changes to
TOPCAT include:
\begin{itemize}
\item New `activation actions', such as causing the display of region around
      an object from an image cutout service. These are extensible.
\item Many plotting improvements -- faster, tidier, flippable axes.
\item Graphical selection of arbitrary shaped subsets.
\item Faster, improved, matching.
\item Support for more table formats (VOTable 1.1, CSV, FITS-plus).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\epsscale{0.6}\plotone{Draper_D-12_2.eps}
\caption{TOPCAT shown selecting an arbitrary region to create a subset}
\end{figure}

For more details of TOPCAT and STIL see Taylor (2005).

\section{FROG, New Application}

Starlink \htmladdnormallink{FROG}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/frog} is a new
time series analysis and display application written in Java. It has been
designed to provide a simple user interface for astronomers wanting to do time
domain astrophysics, but still have access to powerful features like those
found in PERIOD. A full description of FROG can be found in Allan (2005).

\section{ORAC-DR Pipelines}

\htmladdnormallink{ORAC-DR}{http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/software/oracdr}
is a generic pipeline system written by the Joint Astronomy Centre,
Hawaii (Cavanagh et al. 2003), which uses Starlink applications to process
data. As part of its support for UK astronomy Starlink has been developing new
ORAC-DR recipes for some unsupported, or partly supported ESO instruments. A
full description of one such recipe, and its comparison to the developing ESO
equivalent is given in Currie (2005).

\section{GAIA, New Features}

\htmladdnormallinkfoot{GAIA}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/gaia} is a classic
Starlink application (Draper 2004a), based on the
\htmladdnormallink{ESO Skycat}{http://archive.eso.org/skycat/} tool, for the
visualisation and analysis of images and catalogues. 
It offers many proto-VO features, such as remote catalogue and image
downloads, which are widely used. 
Recent changes (beyond its arrival on Mac\,OS\,X and Cygwin, along with the
other Starlink applications) are the ability to display slices from cubes and
to perform automated astrometric calibrations.

\begin{figure}
\epsscale{0.7}\plotone{Draper_D-12_3.eps}
\caption{GAIA displaying a slice, along the third axis of an NDF cube. It is
also possible to step automatically through a range of slices, and collapse
a range into an image. Displayed images can be analysed like any other image.}
\end{figure}

\section{SPLAT, New Features}
\htmladdnormallink{SPLAT}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/splat}
is a Java based tool for visualising and analysing spectra, which is
described in Draper (2004b). Some of its more recent enhancements are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tables access, including VOTable as provided by the STIL library
(Taylor 2005).
\item Graphic annotations and log axes.
\item Interpolated backgrounds using hand-drawn splines.
\item Hierarchical data browsing and access.
\item Spectral line deblending (from the command-line only at present).
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
\epsscale{0.7}\plotone{Draper_D-12_4.eps}
\caption{SPLAT reading a FITS binary table and displaying the spectrum formed
from the two selected columns. Note the use of log axes.}
\end{figure}

\section{Virtual Observatory Tie-ins}

Several of the applications described here process VOTables and offer
Web-service access to their functionality.
They are also written in Java, so are ideally placed to quickly adapt and
interact with VO services as they become available (importantly much of this is
also from a desktop point of view). 
This stance has recently been demonstrated by the extension of SPLAT (now
SPLAT-VO) to include a Simple Spectral Access Protocol UI.
The Starlink classic code base is now much more portable, and freely
available, which makes it more attractive for processing data, and it comes
with a well proven pipeline system, as well as also being wrappable in Java so
that it can act as ready supply of web-services.
For more about Starlink's efforts in the VO area see Giaretta et al. (2005).
