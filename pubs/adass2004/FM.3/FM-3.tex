%
% Derived from ADASS VIII (98) ASP Conference Proceedings template

% Use this template to create your proceedings paper in LaTeX format
% by following the instructions given below.  Much of the input will
% be enclosed by braces (i.e., { }).  The percent sign, "%", denotes
% the start of a comment; text after it will be ignored by LaTeX.  
% You might also notice in some of the examples below the use of "\ "
% after a period; this prevents LaTeX from interpreting the period as
% the end of a sentence and putting extra space after it.  
% 
% You should check your paper by processing it with LaTeX.  For
% details about how to run LaTeX as well as how to print out the User
% Guide, consult the README file.  You should also consult the sample
% LaTeX papers, sample1.tex and sample2.tex, for examples of including
% figures, html links, special symbols, and other advanced features.
%
% If you do not have access to the LaTeX software or a laser printer
% at your site, you can still prepare your paper following the
% instructions in the User Guide.  In such cases, the editors will
% process the file and make any necessary editorial adjustments.

The Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library (STIL) is a pure-Java,
open source library for I/O and manipulation of tabular data such as
astronomical catalogs.  It is written to be high-performance, and to
cope with large tables (not limited by available memory).
The core library is format-neutral, with the work of serialization
and deserialization performed by pluggable format-specific I/O handlers.
This means that the programmer seees a high-level abstraction of a table
which is easy to work with, and also that support for new data 
formats can be added easily.
A corollary is that conversion between any of the supported 
formats is trivial.  Supplied handlers provide support for 
VOTables, FITS table extensions, relational databases via SQL 
and plain text tables, amongst others.
The VOTable handler, which has VOTable-specific as well as generic 
table features, is believed to be the only existing library 
capable of reading or writing all the defined VOTable 
serialization formats (TABLEDATA, FITS, BINARY).

TOPCAT, based on STIL, is a user-friendly graphical program for 
viewing, analysis and modification of tables.
It has facilities for plotting, cross matching, row selection, 
sorting and metadata manipulation.
Synthetic columns can be created and row selections made using a 
powerful and extensible algabraic expression language.

A description of how STIL can be used to read or write VOTables 
or other tables in third party applications is given. 
TOPCAT's analysis, matching and editing facilities were demonstrated;  
this paper summarises a few of these capabilities.

\section{Introduction}

Tables are common in astronomy, and are becoming a particularly
prominent feature of the data produced, transmitted and consumed by
human and software elements of the Virtual Observatory.
The fact that the VOTable format is one of the first standards to become
an IVOA recommendation bears witness to this observation.
A common example of astronomical tabular data is an object catalogue, 
but other examples, such as event lists, are important too.
This paper describes STIL, a library for generic I/O and processing of
tables, and TOPCAT, a graphical user application built on top of STIL.

\section{STIL}

The Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library (STIL) is a generic I/O
and processing library for tabular data.  It is open source (released
under the Gnu Public Licence) and written in pure Java (J2SE1.4),
making it highly portable and easy to deploy.
Central to STIL is a relatively simple model of what a table is, namely
a data structure which has
\begin{itemize}
\item Some per-table metadata, 
      such as name, textual description, curation metadata...
\item Some per-column metadata,
      such as a name, textual description, unit information, 
      Uniform Content Descriptor etc for each column, as well as 
      a description of the shape and type of data it holds 
      (integer, string etc)
\item Cell data themselves, in the form of an entry per column 
      for each of a number of rows
\end{itemize}
The {\tt StarTable} Java language interface embodies this data model,
and it is {\tt StarTable} objects that the programmer deals with
when manipulating tables within STIL.

STIL has no native external data format, but a number of pluggable
input and output handlers.  Input handlers perform the job of 
deserializing tables from external storage and turning them into 
StarTables, while output handlers peform the opposite task of taking
a StarTable and serializing it to external storage.
Since these I/O handlers are separate from the core processing code,
it is easy to change their implementation and add new ones 
without application code being aware of the fact.
In this way the application programmer does not need to know or
care whether the table he is manipulating has been obtained from
a VOTable, FITS HDU, comma-separated value file, or an SQL query
on a relational database.  Moreover, new handlers can be plugged
in at runtime, so that an existing application based on STIL can 
be reconfigured at run-time to read and write new table storage 
formats without any modifications to the code (in practice this
can be done using Java system properties).  This way of working
resembles the way that Java's JDBC database communication layer works.
A schematic diagram of this architecture is given in Figure~\ref{FM3-fig-1}.
\begin{figure}
\plotone{stilarch.eps}
\caption{Schematic of STIL architecture.} \label{FM3-fig-1}
\end{figure}
Among the I/O handlers supplied are ones which can read/write 
the VOTable format, 
FITS BINTABLE and TABLE extensions, 
relational databases, 
and a number of text-based formats.

As well as I/O, STIL provides a number of facilities for manipulation 
of tables including ways to add, remove and rearrange columns and rows,
join and split tables, and modify data and metadata.
Flexible and efficient facilities for cross-matching are also distributed
with the library, though these are currently not properly documented
and somewhat experimental.

Care has been taken to make the I/O and processing facilities scalable
throughout STIL; the aim in particular is that it should be possible 
to process a table with arbitrarily many rows in a finite amount of memory.  
The {\tt StarTable} interface provides both sequential and random
methods of data access for different processing modes; 
in the former limited memory use can be achieved
by streaming the data a row at a time, and in the latter by
caching the cell data in a temporary disk file.

STIL is fully documented; the public classes have comprehensive javadocs,
and a user document, SUN/252, which contains examples and overview
documentation is available in HTML and PDF formats.

\subsection{STIL for VOTables}

As noted above, one of the formats supported by STIL is the XML-based
VOTable format.  Since this is of particular importance in the Virtual
Observatory era, and because it has some notable features, there follow
a few comments on this handler in particular.

The STIL VOTable parser is, as far as we know, the only one
which fully supports the VOTable standard.
Although other available parsers can read the pure-XML TABLEDATA variant
of the format, no others can read the FITS and BINARY variants.
For reasons of bandwidth and CPU efficiency, TABLEDATA is inappropriate
for encoding very large amounts of data, so this ability is of
considerable significance.  As well as reading,
STIL also makes it easy to write VOTables in any of the three variants.

By use of custom stream-based (SAX) parsing, it is also able to
provide a hierarchical in-memory view (DOM) of the structure of a 
VOTable document even when very large tables are involved without
the customary disadvantage of heavy memory usage.  This capability
and how it is achieved are explained in more detail in the documentation.
