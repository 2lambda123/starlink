%
% TEMPLATE.TEX -- APN3 (2003) ASP Conference Proceedings template.
%
% Derived from ADASS VIII (98) ASP Conference Proceedings template
% Updated by N. Manset for ADASS IX (99), F. Primini for ADASS 2000,
% D.Bohlender for ADASS 2001, and H. Payne for ADASS XII and LaTeX2e.
%
% Use this template to create your proceedings paper in LaTeX format
% by following the instructions given below.  Much of the input will
% be enclosed by braces (i.e., { }).  The percent sign, "%", denotes
% the start of a comment; text after it will be ignored by LaTeX.  
% You might also notice in some of the examples below the use of "\ "
% after a period; this prevents LaTeX from interpreting the period as
% the end of a sentence and putting extra space after it.  
% 
% You should check your paper by processing it with LaTeX.  For
% details about how to run LaTeX as well as how to print out the User
% Guide, consult the README file.  You should also consult the sample
% LaTeX papers, sample1.tex and sample2.tex, for examples of including
% figures, html links, special symbols, and other advanced features.
%
% If you do not have access to the LaTeX software or a laser printer
% at your site, you can still prepare your paper following the
% instructions in the User Guide.  In such cases, the editors will
% process the file and make any necessary editorial adjustments.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%			    Paper ID Code
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Enter the proper paper identification code.  The ID code for your
% paper is the session number associated with your presentation as
% published in the official conference proceedings.  You can           
% find this number locating your abstract in the printed proceedings
% that you received at the meeting or on-line at the conference web
% site; the ID code is the letter/number sequence proceeding the title 
% of your presentation. 
%
% This will not appear in your paper; however, it allows different
% papers in the proceedings to cross-reference each other.  Note that
% you should only have one \paperID, and it should not include a
% trailing period.
%
% EXAMPLE: \paperID{O4-1}
% EXAMPLE: \paperID{P7-7}
%

\paperID{ }

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%		            Paper Title 
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Enter the title of the paper.
%
% EXAMPLE: \title{A Breakthrough in Astronomical Software Development}
% 
% If your title is so long as to fill the page header when you print it,
% then please supply a short form as a \titlemark.
%
% EXAMPLE: 
%  \title{Rapid Development for Distributed Computing, with Implications
%         for the Virtual Observatory}
%  \titlemark{Rapid Development for Distributed Computing}
%

\title{ }
%\titlemark{ }

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%		          Authors of Paper
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Enter the authors followed by their affiliations.  The \author and
% \affil commands may appear multiple times as necessary (see example
% below).  List each author by giving the first name or initials first
% followed by the last name.  Authors with the same affiliations
% should grouped together. 
%
% EXAMPLE: \author{Raymond Plante, Doug Roberts, 
%                  R.\ M.\ Crutcher\altaffilmark{1}}
%          \affil{National Center for Supercomputing Applications, 
%                 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL
%                 61801}
%          \author{Tom Troland}
%          \affil{University of Kentucky}
%
%          \altaffiltext{1}{Astronomy Department, UIUC}
%
% In this example, the first three authors, "Plante", "Roberts", and
% "Crutcher" are affiliated with "NCSA".  "Crutcher" has an alternate 
% affiliation with the "Astronomy Department".  The fourth author,
% "Troland", is affiliated with "University of Kentucky"

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%			 Contact Information
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% This information will not appear in the paper but will be used by
% the editors in case you need to be contacted concerning your
% submission.  Enter your name as the contact along with your email
% address.
% 
% EXAMPLE:  \contact{Dennis Crabtree}
%           \email{crabtree@cfht.hawaii.edu}
%

\contact{ }
\email{ }

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%		      Author Index Specification
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Specify how each author name should appear in the author index.  The 
% \paindex{ } should be used to indicate the primary author, and the
% \aindex for all other co-authors.  You MUST use the following
% syntax: 
%
% SYNTAX:  \aindex{Lastname, F. M.}
% 
% where F is the first initial and M is the second initial (if
% used).  This guarantees that authors that appear in multiple papers
% will appear only once in the author index.  
%
% EXAMPLE: \paindex{Crabtree, D.}
%          \aindex{Manset, N.}        
%          \aindex{Veillet, C.}        
%
% NOTE: this information is also used to build the author list that
% appears in the table of contents.  Authors will be listed in the order
% of the \paindex and \aindex commmands.
%

\paindex{ }
\aindex{ }     % Remove this line if there is only one author

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%		      Author list for page header	
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Please supply a list of author last names for the page header. in
% one of these formats:
%
% EXAMPLES:
% \authormark{Lastname}
% \authormark{Lastname1 \& Lastname2}
% \authormark{Lastname1, Lastname2, ... \& LastnameN}
% \authormark{Lastname et al.}
%
% Use the "et al." form in the case of seven or more authors, or if
% the preferred form is too long to fit in the header.

\authormark{ }

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%			Subject Index keywords
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Enter a comma separated list of up to 6 keywords describing your
% paper.  These will NOT be printed as part of your paper; however,
% they will be used to generate the subject index for the proceedings.
% There is no standard list; however, you can consult the indices
% for past proceedings (http://adass.org/adass/proceedings/).
%
% EXAMPLE:  \keywords{visualization, astronomy: radio, parallel
%                     computing, AIPS++, Galactic Center}
%
% In this example, the author noticed that "radio astronomy" appeared
% in the ADASS VII Index as "astronomy" being the major keyword and
% "radio" as the minor keyword.  The colon is used to introduce another
% level into the index.

\keywords{  }

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%			       Abstract
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Type abstract in the space below.  Consult the User Guide and Latex
% Information file for a list of supported macros (e.g. for typesetting 
% special symbols). Do not leave a blank line between \begin{abstract} 
% and the start of your text.

\begin{abstract}          % Leave intact
% Place the text of your abstract here - NO BLANK LINES

\end{abstract}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%			      Main Body
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Place the text for the main body of the paper here.  You should use
% the \section command to label the various sections; use of
% \subsection is optional.  Significant words in section titles should
% be capitalized.  Sections and subsections will be numbered
% automatically. 
%
% EXAMPLE:  \section{Introduction}
%           ...
%           \subsection{Our View of the World}
%           ...
%           \section{A New Approach}
%
% It is recommended that you look at the sample papers, sample1.tex
% and sample2.tex, for examples for formatting references, footnotes,
% figures, equations, html links, lists, and other special features.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%			      References
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% List your references below within the reference environment
% (i.e. between the \begin{references} and \end{references} tags).
% Each new reference should begin with a \reference command which sets
% up the proper indentation.  Observe the following order when listing
% bibliographical information for each reference:  author name(s),
% publication year, journal name, volume, and page number for
% articles.  Note that many journal names are available as macros; see
% the User Guide listing "macro-ized" journals.   
%
% EXAMPLE:  \reference Hagiwara, K., \& Zeppenfeld, D.\  1986, 
%                Nucl.Phys., 274, 1
%           \reference H\'enon, M.\  1961, Ann.d'Ap., 24, 369
%           \reference King, I.\ R.\  1966, \aj, 71, 276
%           \reference King, I.\ R.\  1975, in Dynamics of Stellar 
%                Systems, ed.\ A.\ Hayli (Dordrecht: Reidel), 99
%           \reference Tody, D.\  1998, \adassvii, 146
%           \reference Zacharias, N.\ \& Zacharias, M.\ 2003,
%                \adassxii, \paperref{P7.6}
% 
% Note the following tricks used in the example above:
%
%   o  \& is used to format an ampersand symbol (&).
%   o  \'e puts an accent agu over the letter e.  See the User Guide
%      and the sample files for details on formatting special
%      characters.  
%   o  "\ " after a period prevents LaTeX from interpreting the period 
%      as an end of a sentence.
%   o  \aj is a macro that expands to "Astron. J."  See the User Guide
%      for a full list of journal macros
%   o  \adassvii is a macro that expands to the full title, editor,
%      and publishing information for the ADASS VII conference
%      proceedings.  Such macros are defined for ADASS conferences I
%      through XI.
%   o  When referencing a paper in the current volume, use the
%      \adassxii and \paperref macros.  The argument to \paperref is
%      the paper ID code for the paper you are referencing.  See the 
%      note in the "Paper ID Code" section above for details on how to 
%      determine the paper ID code for the paper you reference.
