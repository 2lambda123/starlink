The GAIA application has been a popular choice for examining and analysing
astronomical images for several years. As data volumes have increased and
spectral and time data cubes have become more prevalent there has been a
strong demand for cube visualization. This paper will briefly describe the
major enhancements that have been made to GAIA to support data cubes including
real-time spectral extraction (single spectrum or area), calculation of
moments, creation of channel maps and movie displays. It will also describe
how PLASTIC interoperability can be used to send extracted spectra to
VO-enabled applications and receive catalogue information.

\section{Introduction}

The JAC has recently started producing data cubes using the HARP focal plane
array receiver and its digital autocorrelation spectrometer ACSIS. These
instruments will be used by astronomers of various levels of experience, so
require a straight-forward data visualisation system, but which is also
astronomically focused, that is has full support for celestial and spectral
coordinates, and can read astronomy data formats (FITS and NDF). A review of
what software is currently available was undertaken by Leech and Jenness, and
with those conclusions in mind work has been undertaken to enhance the GAIA
image display tool to work with data cubes from many different sources and
extreme sizes (4Gb+ on 64bit systems).

Interoperating within other environments, like the VO is clearly desirable for
such a tool, so we have extended GAIA to broadcast spectra, images and tables
and accept images and tables using the PLASTIC protocol (Taylor 2006 et al.).
This allows the sophisticated selections of a tool like TOPCAT, (Taylor, 2005)
to be used, without the need to extend GAIA's table handling.

\section{Displaying Image Slices from Cubes}

The most basic operation when handling cubes is displaying image slices. This
shown in Figure~\ref{D1.1-fig1}. Care has been taken to make sure moving
between slices is a very fast operation.

\begin{figure}
\epsscale{0.8}\plotone{D1.1_1.eps}
\caption{GAIA display a cube and the toolbox with controls for manipulating
the image slice, note that the slice is no.\ 131 along the third axis, which
has a frequency of $2.223439E+10$ Hz. You change the slice by dragging the
slider control}
\label{D1.1-fig1}
\end{figure}

\section{Spectral Extraction}

Extracting a spectrum from a cube is very simple, just clicking on an image
position. The results of doing that are shown in Figure~/ref{D1.1-fig2}.

\begin{figure}
\epsscale{0.8}\plotone{D1.1_2.eps}
\caption{GAIA extracting a spectrum for a single point}
\label{D1.1-fig2}
\end{figure}

In addition to single point extraction you can also extract spectra which are
averaged over regions, circles, rectangles, ellipses, polygons and lines of
various kinds. You can also mark an extracted spectrum as the reference
spectrum for simple point-to-point and region-to-region comparisons.

\section{Coordinate Systems}

The \textbf{Coords} menu offers the chance to switch between a preset list of
common coordinate systems. So you can see you extractions in wavelength,
frequency and (if a rest frequency is defined) velocity. Most of the spectral
systems defined in FITS paper III are supported (using the AST library).

\section{Other operations}

Other operations that are supported on cubes are animating through a range,
collapsing to various integrated measurements, creating channel map images
(where each sub-panel is itself a collapsed range), and interactive baseline
subtraction. Each extracted image can also be operated on by the image
analysis tools of GAIA, so you can get region statistics, aperture photometry,
object detection, contouring, grid overlays etc.

\section{Spectral analysis}

GAIA does not offer any spectral analysis features, concentrating mainly on
visualisation, so you can `send' the extracted spectrum to the SPLAT-VO
(Draper \& Taylor 2006) tool, or any other PLASTIC enabled spectral tool, as
they become available. You can also save spectra to several formats for more
traditional processing.

%\section{Command-line Support}
%
%Many of the GAIA cube facilities (and also its image ones) are available to be
%used from the command-line in the KAPPA (Currie \& Berry, 2006)
%package. Script support is available in the DATACUBE package (Allan \& Currie,
%2006).

\section{Future Developments}

The most obvious missing feature to support datacube visualisation is some
kind of 3D rendering. Clearly there are many sophisticated packages already
available in this field, but they tend to have a steep learning curve and to
not support astronomy concepts very well. With that in mind we expect to
produce a simple interface, that renders isosurfaces and volumes (to an
existing library) and that deals with coordinates and astronomy data formats.

Support for visualisation of CUPID results (HARP and SCUBA-2 data products,
Berry 2006) are also a priority.

\subsection{Obtaining the software}

GAIA is available under the GPL and is part of the `Keoe' JAC binary releases
described at:
\begin{quote}
\makeURL{http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/software/starlink/}
\end{quote}
Currently they are 32/64 bit Linux \& Mac OS X 10.4 builds.

The GAIA source code can be obtained from:
\begin{quote}
\makeURL{http://cvsweb.starlink.ac.uk} \\
\makeURL{http://dev.starlink.ac.uk}
\end{quote}
This known to build under Solaris, Tru64 UNIX, Cygwin
