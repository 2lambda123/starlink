The \htmladdnormallinkfoot{GAIA}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/gaia} application
is a popular choice for examining and analysing astronomical images. As data
volumes have increased and spectral and time data cubes have become more
prevalent there has been a strong demand for cube visualization. This paper
will briefly describe the major enhancements that have been made to GAIA to
support data cubes including real-time spectral extraction (single spectrum or
area), calculation of moments, creation of channel maps and movie displays. It
will also say how the PLASTIC protocol has been used to inter-operate with
Virtual Observatory (VO) enabled applications.

\section{Introduction}

The \htmladdnormallink{JAC}{http://www.jach.hawaii.edu} has started producing
data cubes using the HARP focal-plane array receiver and its digital
autocorrelation spectrometer ACSIS. These instruments will be used by
astronomers of various levels of experience, so require a straight\-forward
data-visualisation system, but which is also astronomically focused, that is,
has full support for celestial and spectral coordinates, and can read
astronomy data formats (FITS and NDF). A review of what software is currently
available was undertaken by Leech and Jenness (2004), and with those
conclusions in mind work has been undertaken to enhance the
\htmladdnormallink{GAIA}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/gaia} 
image display tool to work with data cubes from many different sources and
extreme sizes (4Gb+).

Inter-operating with other environments, like the VO, and co-operating with
specialised tools is clearly desirable, so we have extended 
\htmladdnormallink{GAIA}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/gaia} 
to broadcast spectra, images and tables and accept images and tables using the
\htmladdnormallink{PLASTIC}{http://plastic.sourceforge.net}
protocol (Taylor et al. 2006). This allows the sophisticated selections of a
tool like
\htmladdnormallink{TOPCAT}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat}
(Taylor, 2005) to be used, without the need to extend GAIA's
table handling.

\section{Displaying Image Slices from Cubes}

The most basic operation when handling cubes is displaying image slices. This
shown in Figure~\ref{D1.1-fig1}. Care has been taken to make sure moving
between slices is a very fast operation.

\begin{figure}
\epsscale{0.8}\plotone{D1.1_1.eps}
\caption{GAIA toolbox displaying a cube. Note the image slice is no.\ 114
along the 3rd axis, which has a velocity of $12.94929$ $km/s$.
%You change the slice by dragging the slider control
}
\label{D1.1-fig1}
\end{figure}

\section{Spectral Extraction}

Extracting and displaying a spectrum from a cube is very simple, just click on
an image position and drag around. The spectrum will be interactively updated.

In addition to single-point extraction you can also extract spectra that are
averaged over regions: circles, rectangles, ellipses, polygons and lines of
various kinds. You can also mark an extracted spectrum as the reference
spectrum for simple point-to-point and region-to-region comparisons.
The results of doing these operations are shown in Figure~\ref{D1.1-fig2}.

\begin{figure}
\epsscale{0.8}\plotone{D1.1_2.eps}
\caption{GAIA extracting region spectra. The two regions shown have been
averaged and extracted from the cube.}
\label{D1.1-fig2}
\end{figure}


\section{Coordinate Systems}

\htmladdnormallink{GAIA}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/gaia}
allows you to switch between a preset list of common coordinate systems. So
you can see spectra in wavelength, frequency and, if a rest-frequency is
defined, velocity. Most of the spectral systems defined in FITS paper III are
supported (using the
AST library, see: \htmladdURL{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/ast}).

\section{Other Operations}

Other operations that are supported on cubes are animating through a range,
collapsing to various integrated measurements, creating channel-map images
(where each sub-panel is itself a collapsed range), and interactive baseline
subtraction. Each extracted image can also be operated on by the image
analysis tools of GAIA, so you can get region statistics, aperture photometry,
object detection, contouring, grid overlays etc.

\section{Spectral analysis}

\htmladdnormallink{GAIA}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/gaia}
does not offer any spectral-analysis features, concentrating mainly on
visualisation, so you can `send' the extracted spectrum to the SPLAT-VO tool
(see: \htmladdURL{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/splat}), or any other
\htmladdnormallink{PLASTIC}{http://plastic.sourceforge.net}
enabled spectral tool, as they become available. You can also save spectra to
several formats (FITS, NDF \& text) for more traditional processing.

%\section{Command-line Support}
%
%Many of the GAIA cube facilities (and also its image ones) are available to be
%used from the command-line in the KAPPA (Currie \& Berry, 2006)
%package. Script support is available in the DATACUBE package (Allan \& Currie,
%2006).

\section{Future Developments}

The most obvious missing feature, to support data cube visualisation, is some
kind of 3D rendering. While there are many sophisticated packages already
available in this field, they tend to have a steep learning curve and to
not support astronomy concepts very well. With that in mind we expect to
produce a simple interface, that renders iso-surfaces and volumes (using an
existing library) and that deals with coordinates and astronomy data formats.

Support for visualisation of CUPID results (HARP and SCUBA-2 data products,
Berry 2006) are also a priority.

\subsection{Obtaining the software}

\htmladdnormallink{GAIA}{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/gaia}
is available under the GPL and is part of the `Keoe' JAC binary releases
described at (this release does not include PLASTIC spectrum support):
\begin{quote}
\htmladdURL{http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/software/starlink/}
\end{quote}
Currently they are 32/64 bit Linux \& Mac OS X 10.4 builds.
The GAIA source code can be obtained from (with latest developments):
\begin{quote}
\htmladdURL{http://cvsweb.starlink.ac.uk} \\
\htmladdURL{http://dev.starlink.ac.uk}
\end{quote}
This known to build under Solaris, Tru64 UNIX and Cygwin, as well.
